So within the space of two months, we have seen Nick Cannon go on an antisemitic rant, DeSean Jackson claim Hitler made good points, Shein released a Swastika pendant and now Wiley has gone on a 24 hour long twitter rant about how the Jews are Satanic and that we should 'hold the corn', literally meaning he is willing to kill us merely for being Jewish.
I as a Jew have gone on BLM marches, I have signed the petitions to take down statues I have donated my money to help these causes. I have called out the Chinese government for committing ethnic cleansing. I have called out the Israeli government over plans to annex the West bank and
over illegal settlments. The important thing is I as a Jew am not alone in this, every Jew I know has done the same.
So I beg with each and every one of you please condemn this antisemitism from anyone else who threatens us for being Jewish.
This is not a question of Zionism or anti-zionism, everyone must realise this. I am merely pleading with every person who claims to fight against racism and bigotry to include Jews in this fight. I truly fear if we are left alone to fight this our voices will never be loud enough.","#leedsfess22827

CW: Gender Dysphoria and Mental Health
I wanted to share something which to be honest has been on my mind for a few years now and have recently come to terms with this, also with what may contribute to my mental health struggles. As I was unsure what it was. Some of you may have an idea, some may not.
But basically, I'm essentially not comfortable with my body. Not just because of my figure, but because of my gender. I essentially feel like I am trapped in the wrong body. I present myself as very masculine, but mentally in my head I feel like I am masculine also. The only feminine aspect of me is basically my boobs and vagina.
I came more into terms with this when I was doing my dissertation back in 2018, with Judith Butler's theories on gender performance and psychology.
I have days where I just want to rip my boobs off and that I could be reborn as a guy, but then there's days where I am unphased. The worst days were when my last set of antidepressants weren't working and were making me have the most horrific hallucinations and hearing voices. Hallucinations of me just imagining I am cutting down my chest and stuff, shaving my head and all. Hearing voices that I am not the right person, etc. But fortunately now I am on better medication and I am in a better headspace.
Gender dysphoria is something that is constantly in the back of my head, I wanted to share this to give clarity on myself. As lockdown has given me a lot to think about and as I wanted to be more open about myself.
I have considered transitioning, however that is something I have decided not to go through with it. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this?","#leedsfess22824

I'm sick of getting shit for being a ""student landlord"". Please bear with while I explain why.
I get that most students have a really shit experience with landlords in general, hell, I did in first year and that was halls! But I've worked damn hard to get where I am and I'll not have some people tell me otherwise.
I started work at 14, I worked 12-20 hours a week while doing GCSEs and at least 18 while doing A Levels. I saved every goddamn penny. I was a free school meals kid all my life, I didn't get to go on all the school trips or days out with my mates and more often than not I didn't ask, I knew my mum couldn't afford it (especially as I was the eldest of 3 kids).
So when I hit 16 and started thinking about University, I hated the idea of paying rent, money that I'd worked so hard for felt almost wasted. So I decided to save for a house deposit. Now don't get me wrong, I was looking at shit houses pretty far away from uni (I'd always had my heart set on Leeds) but my mum started saving what she could, on the condition that I would pay her back when I could afford it so I could live somewhere half decent and closer to uni.
Between us, I managed to buy a house near the end of 1st year and got my mates moved in pretty quickly after. They got a lower rent, and I knew that my mortgage and bills were covered, so my ""rent"" every month of second year paid my mum back.
I worked 3 jobs alongside a full time degree, but I saved my entire student loan (and given my mum is a single parent household I qualified for the higher amount) which almost paid her back in full.
Now I'm going into third year, I've paid my mum back in full, my friends/tenants are all happy and if they have any issues I'm there instantly. When COVID fucks off I'll still be working 3 jobs in my final year but it's not easy maintaining a house. I've spent a lot on this house, all out of my own pocket, but to come from the poverty line to where I am now? I'm fucking proud of myself. So when you start having a go or lack sympathy for someone, anyone, take a second and realise you don't know their story.
Whether you're BAME, LGBTQ+, economically disadvantaged, struggling mentally, disabled, or just human in some way shape or form, please know that your story matters. People will give you shit because they think they're better than you, or because they think you're better off than them, but fuck 'em. I for one have had enough of people giving me shit when they don't know me or my situation.
I'm fucking proud to be a student landlord. It was not an easy task. Many fucks to you if you try to tell me otherwise.","#leedsfess22820

Just a few rules of thumb for speaking to your balding student mates:
- “You know you're receding?”, “you know you're going at the crown a bit?” ... don't worry we definitely already know.
As much as its bants to take the piss, balding lads will take it fine when they're with you but they'll be thinking about how you think they're lid is shit for a long time after you've said it. The worst thing about balding is its not you're choice, its not a result of your actions and there's very few things you can do about it.
The genuine options a balding lad has:
- Stay balding (taken the piss out of - affordable)
- Shave it off completely (frowned upon in early 20's but possibly one of the stronger options for mental health - affordable)
- Hair transplant (frowned upon - EXPENSIVE)
- Wear a toupee (very frowned upon - EXPENSIVE)
- Take finasteride (fucks with your hormones and can leave your sexually dysfunctional and depressed - EXPENSIVE)
- Use minoxidyll (pretty decent short term but EXPENSIVE)
I'm not complaining about balding. I'm just saying stop taking the piss out of balding lads cause its not easy and they're probably really struggling with all the comments you're making and you don't even know it. Losing your hair in your early 20's can be very sudden and pretty traumatic.","#leedsfess22814

Who would have thought the controversial Gogglebox ranker would make a comeback? This time I’ve gone for a score system approach, which only seemed fair for our Gogglebox Celebs.
Rylan and his: the ultimate mother/son duo, constant laughs made even better with their accents 9/10
Mo Gilligan & Babatunde: bounce jokes off each other constantly, 1 half comedian, great pair 8/10
Ashley Roberts & Jamie Theakston: pretty basic, couple of laughs but mainly average, 5/10
Shaun Ryder & Bez: their brains are basically fried from non-stop drugs in the 90’s and we love to see it, classic party bois, 10/10
Joanna David & Emilia Fox: who? 2/10
Eammon Holmes & Ruth Langsford: give me very classic wine mum and dad, have the same vibes as a Sunday Roast at your nan’s, 6.5/10
Martin & Roman Kemp: World’s Sexiest Dad and Lad 2020, would call them both Daddy, 9/10
Laura Whitmore & Iain Stirling: stick your Love Island maybe? Should be good but unfortunately fall flat, 4/10
Harry & Sandra Redknapp: Harry was raging about Jam Roly Poly once on I’m a Celeb and it’s the only funny thing he’s ever done, 3/10
Joe Swash & Stacey Solomon: quite disappointed tbh, our Stace is hilarious on insta but has failed to tickle my rib cage as of yet, 5/10
Denise Van Outen & Eddie: they wind each other up something rotten and it is hilarious, however jokes are few and far between, 7/10
Nick & Liv Grimshaw: literally the rich version of Peter and Sophie but boring, crack some jokes why don’t ya, 3/10
Zoey Ball & Woody: Woody was shit on The Circle and he is shit on Gogglebox, is scarily ‘edgy Leeds’, 4/10
KSI & S-X: We expected comedy and they did not disappoint, great friends so great banter, 7/10
Gyles & Maureen: Gyles is funny in an old academic way, which isn’t everyone’s cuppa tea, bang on average, 5/10
Nicola Adams & Ella Bain: haven’t seen much of these, but what I have seen I haven’t enjoyed, lacking the quality jokes a good gogglebox family needs, 4/10
Vic Reeves & Jools Holland: Where’s Bob Mortimer at Vic? We really needed him to save 2020, Jools stick to late night music, 3/10
Johnny Vegas & Bev: meh, Johnny Vegas doesn’t deliver on the comedy that we really need! Bev seems nice tho, 6/10
Nigel Havers & Denis Lawson: give me the biggest upper class Tory vibes, might as well have invited Stanley Johnson and Toff back for another season, would love to be Nigel’s sugar baby, 3/10
Judge Rinder & Susanna Reid: very great comedy duo, nice to see them not being serious for once, letting their hair down, 7/10
If any celebs are missing it’s because they’re unworthy of my time for some reason or another.

I have a friend going through these issues all simultaneously and is massively overwhelmed. I just want to be able to help and support them in the best way I possibly can to help them heal, but I feel lost at where to start and totally useless to them at the moment.

We have the power to change the Leeds student culture. Lets normalise that when you go home with someone, you have some water and some chips and make sure your partner isn’t too drunk to have sex. Ask the question and look for the signs. Consent isn’t just whether someone said yes. Consent is a yes from someone who is sober enough to make the decision. If someone has thrown up - don’t have sex. If someone won’t remember the sex in the morning - don’t have sex. And if you aren’t sure if someone is too drunk to have sex - don’t have sex. I trusted a friend to take care of me when I was drunk and was assaulted. My hope is that a few people change their attitudes having heard experiences of sexual assault on Leedsfess and start having these conversations before their one night stand. Their partner will then feel more comfortable and respected and make sure they do the same for their next hookup. Let’s keep each other safe because sex can be so fun but only when it’s consensual.","#leedsfess22803

I’ve been seeing lots of posts about sexual assault in Leeds. I was sexually assaulted in January and my housemate searched for resources which could help me come to terms with what happened. In the end I went to the Hazlehurstcentre which I would heavily recommend, they allowed me to tell them what happened in a safe space and wrote down my account of events, they took swabs as proof(not essential if you don’t want to take it to the police.) I knew the guy and didn’t want to get the police involved, which the centre didn’t push at all, it just provided me with a safe environment to share and feel heard.(They also keep everything for 7 years in case later on you do decide to take it to the police.) They also got in touch with victim support for me who have been supporting me ever since. I would really recommend if you feel able to get in touch with these resources as they have genuinely made processing the situation feel more bearable. There are a lot on the uni website but I completely appreciate that it is daunting and overwhelming to have to look by yourself or even properly come to terms with it.
Here are some links I’ve found that are on the website that might help: https://www.hazlehurstcentre.org/
https://www.idas.org.uk/
https://karmanirvana.org.uk/
And also the Jyoti service which is for BAME women and girls, with services available in Punjabi, Mir Puri and English.)
I just wanted to finish my very long leedsfess by saying although it’s an awful thing to happen, your sexual assault does not define you, you are so strong and will get through this.","#leedsfess22790

TW: Sexual assault
On my second day of first year I think I was spiked and sexually assaulted in uni accommodation. I didn't know anyone except people in my block. That night, there was a party across the entire residence i was living at. Myself and one of the people from my block went to another block to socialise. During this time I only drank one shot and half a can of beer, which was still in my hand. I remember talking to a guy who I thought was attractive for about 20 minutes and things started to go black.
I don't remember walking to my block with him in hand to my room. I don't remember letting him inside and being pushed onto the bed. I don't remember anything except a weird pulsing-feeling of blackness and then seeing him briefly after falling off the bed multiple times and being shocked into reality.
I woke up the next morning not remembering anything except feeling completely sore. I was a virgin. I checked my phone and apparently after the boy left the room, I called a girl I met on my first day to come over. She told me she came around 2/3am and told me I was sobbing, telling her that that boy used me.
I messaged the boy the morning after, and he denied anything further than oral.
I've bumped into these boy countless times and he hasn't once come up to me to say sorry for taking advantage of me in my moment of weakness.
I hope other freshers doesn't have to go through something like this.","#leedsfess22787

CW: Sexual Assault
In response to the post about male sexual assault, I have two experiences, first was at my leavers ball, when the only (to my knowledge) openly gay guy at school grabbed my ass, and when confronted about it he said it was because “I looked good in black tie”,
My second was in Leeds, and it was the same incident, a gay grabbed my ass, and when I turned to look at him I was smiled and winked at, which made me feel genuinely small, and devalued to just how looked.
My experiences aren’t as bad as I know a lot of guys are, but I cannot think of a discussion more important than male sexual harassment and assault, as a student body we all have to stand up against those who feel they can degrade individuals of any gender and feel they have the right to act in such a disgraceful way. And while mine are “minor” incidents, I know many more will have far worse and I hope they can speak about these one day, the mentality many men have is to simply ignore these and that simply cannot carry on.
I hope this might make a few guys feel like they can talk a bit more, and that as a community we can start to realise this is a genuine issue compounded by the general dismissal society has of male issues if this nature, especially mental health.
Big love, stay classy Leeds xx","#leedsfess22781

Just gonna bring the societies topic back up. So I personally think there needs to be more inclusion in some of them. I joined a few societies at the start of my second year and really thought the LGBT+ society at Beckett would be a great way to meet new people like me (also gay). I’m quite a shy and reserved person so I find it hard to make friends but I always went to the events and barely anyone seemed interested to get to know me even after the first time meeting. The problems with societies like these is that they have a friend group already built and they struggle to let new people in, for a society that was all about inclusion I felt very pushed out. Most of them would just smile acknowledge I was there and carry on clumping together in their own group. I made a couple good friends but overall I just think we need to support people better. If you’re joining a society it should feel like everyone is welcomed into the group no matter how many people are already friends, it’s more daunting for us the quiet ones to put ourselves out there in an already competitive community.","#leedsfess22779

After 4 months I still have difficulty breathing and a chronic post viral fatigue that leaves me exhausted and in bed after doing literally anything. Mental health suffering a bit because of it.

Here’s your daily reminder not to buy fast fashion. You are supporting the enslavement of vulnerable people and putting communities at risk of poor sanitation and Covid-19. What people usually fail to realise is that if you buy clothes from reputable brands with proper protections for their staff, the clothes may cost more, but they are better made and last longer. We cannot accept the argument that working class people are somehow exempt from a boycott of fast fashion because they can’t afford the alternative because it doesn’t make sense. A t shirt bought from Primark or Boohoo will last far less washes/wearing than one from a better brand. Therefore while you might save money on that particular item, over the lifetime of a more expensive product, you will have spent the equivalent on cheap clothing which puts money in the pockets of exploitative slave owners at Boohoo and the like. We all have to change our shopping practices together and those who don’t are just apologists for modern slavery quite frankly.","#leedsfess22775

CW: sexual abuse
Not really wanting to go into details as I've not fully accepted it but hoping to offer some personal thoughts on the subject as it feels like something that ain't talked about (by men, as far as I know).
While I've not knowingly been assaulted in my sleep for over a year or so I was manipulated and sexually abused (drug induced coercion n shit) by someone who I thought was a friend. I didn't realize throughout, and being a guy I didn't acknowledge how it was affecting me (a lot, apparently ).
Was only when mentioning it casually to a female friend that it was pointed out to me what was happening and the grim feelings felt justified. Took a while after to get out of it and really not through the woods yet in terms of dealing with the self hatred n resentment for the friends who were/ are still complicit.
While I don't have any real advice on how to deal with it, that female friend pointed out if I swapped the genders around and all the assumptions that came with them then I'd get a better idea of how it was. Ain't ideal in all situations but having a ""typically feminine"" personality in a lot of ways myself, it helped me see it in a way that wasn't coloured by my assumptions about gender roles in sexual abuse.
A few things that prevented me from coming to terms with it have been:
-At the time actually liking the non sexual side of it.
-Insecurity about my own masculinity, being used against me.
-Jordan Peterson.
-Not really knowing what was goin on.
-Them knowing no one would take it seriously.
-People finding out n either thinking im a pussy or hating her n it breaking up friendships (turns out both happened).
-People telling me I should have just physically pushed her away (felt like it would have just escalated the situation n previously she had become very violent).
A few things that helped:
-telling a close mate.
-Jordan Peterson.
-Realizing no one deserves it n it can even happen to them ripped guys who do rugby n talk manly shit.
-Time and distance.
- Laughing at that mid noughties song ""Boys Will Be Boys"" cosa the irony
-Remembering it can happen to anyone.
-Writing this to be fair.
Male sexual abuse is just sexual abuse, think it's good to share different experiences n while I don't think men being the victim as prevalent it is nuanced n experienced/perpetrated differently enough that without guys talking about it it's not gonna be properly addressed as a whole.
Hope I can sleep now, thx","#leedsfess22773

CW: Sexual Harassment/assault
In response to leedsfess22677, I think that there isn't enough attention raised around sexual assault/harassment regarding men at university. While my experience is not anywhere near as bad as what some of my female friends and girlfriend have gone through, it did leave me feeling rather uncomfortable. I have had girls try and kiss me unprovoked, pinch my arse, touch me over the trousers, and all of the experiences left me feeling somewhat powerless. I knew that if I complained to security or bouncers in any of these places I would be laughed out of there, which can be difficult as I know if the genders were reversed, and I was a girl instead of a big bloke and vice versa, they would be thrown out. It's a very common misconception that men simply do not experience sexual assault or harassment, from women or other men, and if they have and subsequently try and talk about it with friends, things are said like ""but you must have done something"" or ""but did you fancy her/him"", or its dismissed entirely because of the fact that you are a man. I hope that the stigma around male sexual assault changes as it isn't something that should be considered taboo. We're making progress (albeit not enough) to help women deal with assault and harassment from men, I would like to see more prominent movements supporting a male equivalent.
Just because a girl or guy is your friend, does not mean that their advancements upon you should be dismissed as a result. I recognise that in the current sociopolitical climate, we need to be doing a lot to liberate women from rapists. but I do feel that we should be doing more to acknowledge the impact of sexual assault upon men as well, and I hope the university can do more in this regard.","#leedsfess22770

So I’m a Leeds fan and I’m happy that leeds are going up. But I was just told that you can’t be mad about the football celebrations in Leeds when I wasn’t mad about the BLM protests.
Let me just explain why I can be mad about this.
Football celebrations are celebrations, their aim is not to change anything, you can have those celebrations in a smaller settings. You can’t do this with a protest.
Additionally all the pictures of the blm protests people were sober, socially distanced and most were wearing masks. At these football celebrations you can see drunk strangers hugging each other, during a pandemic. Not okay.
And finally, there is a shift in power here. The people who attended the BLM protests (families, POC etc) were treated with hostility by police and the media. The majority of football fans are white men, police let these celebrations happen, the media are referring to these white men as just ‘enjoying themselves’. Not saying they are risking lives, that it’s unnecessary or hooliganism, phrases they used to describe the BLM protesters that were calling for change, for something that really matters.
Thanks for coming to my ted talk","#leedsfess22765

Right, so bear with me.
In first year I joined a certain society, I didn’t know anything about initiation so I went along with it to not feel excluded. The peer pressure was very much in play but I also made the dumb decision to go along with it to not feel alone. The result was me blacking in and out and doing some stuff I’m not proud of.
I realised a couple of weeks later that people had filmed me without consent and when asked to delete videos I was brushed off. I went to the President at the time but nothing came of it and I was once again brushed aside.
I’m considering going to the union to get the people involved to delete these videos because they’ve also showed them to other people since.
What do I do?
Side note: when you realise someone is drunk beyond the reasonable point, don’t film them that’s a dick move. And don’t go the step further of showing it to people that causes great anxiety and psychological harm on someone.","#leedsfess22763

I’m considering going to the union to get the people involved to delete these videos because they’ve also showed them to other people since.
What do I do?
Side note: when you realise someone is drunk beyond the reasonable point, don’t film them that’s a dick move. And don’t go the step further of showing it to people that causes great anxiety and psychological harm on someone.",,1595183107,,,116,5,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=630707614216108&id=279761922644014,

Okay so I think I sorta solved world hunger.
Step one: nationalise Heinz baked beans
Step Two: if there are 70,000 Pallets of beans in the Heinz national distribution centre, with 100 cases per pallet and 24 cans per case and 460 beans in a can.... That's 77.3 Billion beans in one national distribution centre which equates roughly to 10 beans per person on the planet per day.
Step three: cut down the beef industry so less cows=less methane in the atmosphere (there are other reasons beef production is bad for the planet but that's not my point I still like steak I just wanna solve world hunger more than I wanna eat a cow)
Step four: invest money saved on beef production into building more Heinz baked beans factories and distribution centres and probably add some stuff so beans become like all the nutrients anyone needs
Step five: Everyone is given a bean ration for the day
Step six: methane levels stay the same because farts
In conclusion - save the planet with beans?
In further conclusions - I've got far too much time","#leedsfess22761

Uni is hard, yes you can get by without going to lectures and going out all the time but at the end of the day you have to put the work in.
I barely went to uni all three years of my course, I have scraped a 2:1 this year but at the cost of my mental health.
I have been through heartbreak, struggled with drinking/drug addiction and loneliness.
But I am graduating with friends that support me no matter what, that I can truly rely on, I have had had some wonderful times and to everyone still in Leeds next year, make the most of it bc sometimes you won’t know what you’ve lost til it’s over.","#leedsfess22757

'I just wish people would clean up their fucking quinoa'
'Tell you what this house needs, a nice cheeseboard'
'I'm adding chia seeds to my macaroni for aesthetic purposes'
(followed minutes later by)
'Ugh there's chia seeds all over the table'
'I'm always in the spinach mood !'

Okay niche but here's my take on what Leeds uni buildings would be as school years.
Year 7: Conference auditorium, it's obnoxious, it's big, it thinks it's better than it is, like fuck off noone has ever been like 'boy oh boy in going to conference auditorium, I just love the ambiance in there', grow up
Year 8: Laidlaw, it thinks it's cool and mature, but really it's kinda cringy and the bottom of the totem pole. Just because you've got a coffee and put on makeup doesn't make you mature, go back to where u belong
Year 9: 100% Roger Stevens it's awkward, it's average, the leedsfess about it having geography energy hit the nail on the head.
Year 10: EC stoner, it's getting there, but it's convuluted and bizzare, we'll never know quite why it's like 'that' but we're coming to accept it for it, and it's not really that bad.
Year 11: Parkinson thinks it's hot shit, it thinks it's the best around, and that it's reached the pinnacle of maturity, it's old, it's physically large, it's on the logo, what's not to like! Well sadly there's nothing rocking around inside really, and it's kinda pretentious.
Year 12: Fine art, it's cool, it's chique, it's sexy, it's got 'boys in the year below', it may never be too dog, but it could be better, and everyone knows it
Year 13: eddy B its truly is the best of the best, maybe a little big too big for its boots, maybe abit too 'edgy' to fit in, but it's well cool, and lots of the other buildings look up to it. But when you look at it from the outside perspective, you realise it's still just a kid, it's still kinda cringy and awkward, and it has a long way to come.","#leedsfess22737

Year 12: Fine art, it's cool, it's chique, it's sexy, it's got 'boys in the year below', it may never be too dog, but it could be better, and everyone knows it
Year 13: eddy B its truly is the best of the best, maybe a little big too big for its boots, maybe abit too 'edgy' to fit in, but it's well cool, and lots of the other buildings look up to it. But when you look at it from the outside perspective, you realise it's still just a kid, it's still kinda cringy and awkward, and it has a long way to come.",,1594988479,,,106,2,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=629235464363323&id=279761922644014,

Lockdown has literally felt like standing in the queue for walkabout on a Wednesday in February.
POV: You’re absolutely freezing your tits off for ages but you know the wait will be worth it. You salivate at the thought of all the doubles you can afford to get, the 3 jägers for a fiver, the cringe tunes they’ll blast. As soon as you walk in, the gust of warm air and the smell of booze and horny fresher boys hits you. The beep you hear from the card machine at the bar whilst paying for your drinks is a truly spectacular sound.
Before you know it, it’s four am and you’ve blown £30 just on jägers but life is good. You’ve pulled but are too drunk to see the guy’s face but you hastily add him on snap. As you stumble into the uber with the girls, open the window for some damage control (we don’t like being charged for puking in an Uber now do we?), you take a deep breath. The beautiful city of Leeds is in your lungs.
This is what I think lockdown and social distancing being eased permanently might feel like.

Seeing Car Mechanics, Gas Fitters and Plumbers being listed as various types of ""....... engineer"" is starting to make me angry. Using the term engineer for people who are (quite respectably) fitters, technicians, mechanics, plumbers, etc makes zero sense to many professional engineers.
Why is it that the term engineer has been diluted and devalued so much in the UK? I spent years learning how to integrate my arse off and am lumped into the same terminology. Why is Engineer not a protected title in the UK? I understand a Professional Engineer and Chartered Engineer is, yet it goes further than this and has devalued the term massively in this country.
Both are highly respected fields. I cannot do many things a gas fitter, mechanic or plumber does to the same high level. Yet I imagine they cannot do any of the high-level maths many engineers face daily. The classification is important? We design the things that they fix and fit. Engineers make moon landings possible, design replacement heart valves to keep people alive and will help save the planet with energy solutions. Yet without the tradespeople, technicians etc, we as Engineers would be lost building and maintaining these designs. WE NEED EACH OTHER.
Yet you get plumbers calling themselves Engineers all the time. Or people who fit and fix things doing the same?! In Germany, the title Engineer is just as respected as Doctor and Lawyer. The same cannot be said for the UK and I am fed up.
Engineers design, find solutions and invent. They don't simply fix, fit and maintain things like a ""Gas Engineer"" would. Engineers design combi boilers, fitters and plumbers fit and repair them so stop the fraudulent use of the term ""engineer"".
TL;DR I half don't want to tell people what I do, for the idea that they'll see me as someone who fixes their car. The UK needs to stop referring to tradespeople as Engineers. They are not us. Over 2 million people in the UK use the term Engineer and it is getting a joke.

CW: Sexual assault
This year alone I have been assaulted 3 times the first time was my boyfriend at the time, the other time was a stranger whom one I don’t know and other was someone I thought was a friend. I told my friends are there really supportive but it took a while for it to even hit me, during quarantine was when I clicked that what had happened was sexual assault. I haven’t told my family I don’t want them to know.
There is very few guys I trust now. There’s not one single person I know who hasn’t been sexually assault and some still have not hit that that’s what it was. I’m scared to be out on my own or even in a group, I’m scared to be in a house with locked doors by myself. It haunts me That I was assaulted and that just like many others haven’t and won’t go to the police. It still feels like I’m a burden to everyone and I don’t want to burden with with this problem. I know the police won’t listen as there’s no evidence anymore due to it been months after. Physically I’m ok now but mentally I’m drained, I’m scared and feel completely alone.
There’s so much more to my story like there is everyone’s and nobody will completely tell you there story.
I wanted to share a part of mine I feel like it might help someone to know there not alone, it can be a friend or family or a complete stranger; you can know right away or it can take months or years to know and understand what happened some choose to not believe it, I feel like we need a better sex education as most are not taught basic consent.","#leedsfess22710

I know the police won’t listen as there’s no evidence anymore due to it been months after. Physically I’m ok now but mentally I’m drained, I’m scared and feel completely alone.
There’s so much more to my story like there is everyone’s and nobody will completely tell you there story.
I wanted to share a part of mine I feel like it might help someone to know there not alone, it can be a friend or family or a complete stranger; you can know right away or it can take months or years to know and understand what happened some choose to not believe it, I feel like we need a better sex education as most are not taught basic consent.",,1594749847,,,59,0,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=627536104533259&id=279761922644014,

When I was traveling in Europe I ran out of money so my dads best friend paid for a hotel near him. When I got there he text me saying he was in the hotel bar waiting for a catch up. When I got there he was SO drunk and started being so weird with me saying how good my body looked and saying he liked me touching my knee and stuff. He then ordered us a cab to a bar and I felt weird about it but couldn’t rly say no because he’d done me a huge favour with the hotel. When we got there he was being even more touchy until he bought me a drink when I leaned over to get it he slapped my arse then pulled me to him by the waist. I left pissed off and upset then nothing was ever said. I’ve never told my dad but I really don’t know if I should. Like it was THAT deep but at the same time it’s his friend but at the same time he was so drunk idk if he’d even remember. I’m torn any advice?","#leedsfess22706

Internalised homophobia is a real issue within the LGBTQ community. I am a gay man who used to be fixated on the idea of “trying to pass” and trying to be more masculine than I probably am in order to seem as straight acting as possible, even though I‘m not ashamed or embarrassed to say I’m gay. I didn’t want to be associated with the flamboyant gay male stereotype, thinking that it would be an attack on my character in some way. But even if I was, why did I think this was so bad? I’ve been proud to welcome people as they are, and coming across people from all walks of life I have met many fabulous and flamboyant characters and not judged them, yet I didn’t want my image to be associated with this.
Furthermore, when I log onto tinder or Grindr (we have needs what can I say) nearly every other profile will say something along the lines of “straight acting only, only into masculine guys” and we’re very quick to put each other into a box and presume that if they’re not overtly masculine or the straight male type then we’re not going to be interested and to discard them.
I’ve honestly thought about this a lot recently and realised how ridiculous I was being. I am who I am and I would be the same if I liked women, and people need to realise that being gay or whatever does not define your personality nor is personality trait. Everyone is neither fully effeminate nor complete masculine, gender is fluid. Having a preference is one thing, but we are creating a stigma within our own community when we have enough prejudice from the outside world to be dealing with. We are who we are, and we happen to be a little camp so fucking what, a camp world with rainbows is looking far more desirable than the crumbling world we currently have anyway.","#leedsfess22704

When I worked at dominos, whever we ran out of toppings, we'd go to the nearest shop to buy the most similar looking alternative.
My manager also changed the dates on the meats (they had us date them ourselves) so we were pretty much always serving out of date meat.
The chain is so dead on wanting profits that they made it easy for us to do these things which meant they would ask us under the radar to do them.
A prime example that if anything went wrong, it'd be us in store who would take the heat and those higher up would pretend they knew nothing about it.
If the profits weren't high enough, targets weren't being met, and we didn't do the sketchy things they'd ask of us, they would threaten to fire us or cut down the stores staff hours. Some shifts we'd have one driver and one person in store (who took orders and made pizzas) which is pretty much impossible to run efficiently.
Since everyone there was in need of a job, everyone stuck it out until we found something better.
The dominos stores are split into branches so they all have different managements. I know the ones in leeds aren't a part of the branch I worked in but they probably aren't much better.","#leedsfess22699

I really wasn't sure of how I could go back to Leeds after travelling down to Bristol and get involved in all of the standard freshers festivities. However, people I had known for literally a week, rallied around me, and supported me.
What I am trying to say is that you will have tough times, but there are genuine people who are always willing to help you out.

And without doubt, I have had serious issues over the last three years; however, the people that I've met have gone above and beyond their duty in helping and supporting me through some tough times.

So, if you're a prospective student and/or someone who's just finished first year, let me tell you this. There will be tough times, there's no denying that. However, there are some truly sensational people at Leeds who I know will help anyone through anything.

CW: Sexual assault
Okay, this feels really weird/scary opening up about this, even if it is anonymous. But I have been struggling with these events that have happened to me over the past years which I have kept in the notes on my phone. Growing up, I didn't really know what sexual assault was, as in my mind it was usually always rape that involved violence. The following experiences made me so uncomfortable and for years I would question whether or not these were assault or if I was just being dramatic. Some of these seem insignificant, but I have been feeling broken, ashamed and used over the past few months.
Age 12/13: A grown man in my family felt my bra straps and made a remark about me wearing a bra already. He would also tell me what food I should eat to make my breasts grow and would always feel my back to feel if I was wearing a bra. I felt so uncomfortable but didn't know why.
Age 15: I was groped by a group of older guys (around 5) in a club who formed a circle around me in a corner. They grabbed my chest, butt and all over my body for only a few seconds. I was underage, they were around 18/19.
Age 16: An older man, maybe in his fifties, watched me trying on a bra in the changing rooms of a lingerie shop. I didn't realise until I made eye contact with him in the mirror as the curtains were not wide enough and left a gap. I felt violated, mostly because of his age.
Age 18: A guy in a club started kissing me after I was having a friendly chat with him. I tried to pull away but he forced his tongue in my mouth and held onto me. It was so forceful, I could not get away.
Age 18: A man lied about his age to appear younger, pressured me to have unprotected sex after saying no several times but kept insisting.
Age 19: A man in his forties wanted me to kiss him because he had ""done me a favour"" and I needed to ""repay him"". I kissed him on the cheek and he turned his face and forced me to kiss him on the mouth.
Age 19: A guy I kissed at a house party later wanted to sleep next to me. Me and my friends were all sleeping at this house and I shared a bed with him and my friend. I was falling asleep, and he started pushing his penis into me from behind. I just pretended to be asleep.
Age 20/21: My boyfriend wanted to try anal sex and I said no several times, but eventually said okay. It was so painful that I cried and kept saying how much it hurt. He said, ""I know, I know, it will soon be over"".
I hate to think of other girls going through the same thing and only experiencing the trauma years later. Some of these experiences involve people in my life, so I don't feel comfortable talking to someone who knows me. I wish I could be part of a safe space with other girls sharing their experiences who can validate my experiences so I don't feel like I'm overthinking all this. I don't know where to turn to right now.","#leedsfess22681
CW: Sexual assault
Okay, this feels really weird/scary opening up about this, even if it is anonymous. But I have been struggling with these events that have happened to me over the past years which I have kept in the notes on my phone. Growing up, I didn't really know what sexual assault was, as in my mind it was usually always rape that involved violence. The following experiences made me so uncomfortable and for years I would question whether or not these were assault or if I was just being dramatic. Some of these seem insignificant, but I have been feeling broken, ashamed and used over the past few months.

Do many guys get sexually assaulted? For those that have, how did you feel about and deal with it?
I've mostly only ever heard about things from a girl's perspective but not really any men who would technically fall under the same category.
Personally, being an incredibly deep sleeper, I've had 3 girls take advantage of that, from kissing to ""touching"". I'm not entirely sure what to think of it, I've mostly just passed it off because they were girls I had some feelings or attraction towards.","#leedsfess22677

There have been a lot of posts recently about how the uni have dealt with the pandemic, and a lot of people seem dissatisfied with how their school have handled the situation, so I’m here to talk about how student nurses have been treated by the school of healthcare these last few months. I’m by no means saying that we’ve been treated the worst or that we’re worse off than other courses, just want people to understand what we’ve been through.
We were given the choice to either go into a paid placement or to stay at home, the majority of us chose placement and many turned down jobs and moved back to Leeds etc. The communication from the uni was shocking, we were given so little information about our options and when we finally were given options, we received barely any info on when we’d be starting and how it’d impact the course.
After weeks of hardly any communication from the uni we were told that we’d be starting in 2 weeks and that we needed to do our training and get ready for placement ASAP. We were then told A FEW DAYS before starting training that we weren’t needed anymore and that we’d have a shorter placement in August. Again, many of us turned down jobs for this and had already paid for train tickets etc.
Having a shorter placement also means that we likely will have to make up the hours at some point, we’ll either have to overwork ourselves in 3rd year OR do an extra placement at the end of 3rd year and qualify late.
I understand that not all of this is the uni’s fault, but the communication we got from them was appalling and the fact that they’ve refused to accept ANY responsibility is even worse.
Sincerely, a very stressed student nurse who just wants to qualify","#leedsfess22675

Since some of us are talking about Hong Kong and the CCP I wish to address the Uighur situation: please note that I wish to keep politics out of discussion as much as possible – I want to focus solely on the humanitarian side, and what we can do to help (see end)
In Brief: Over 1 million Uighur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and other minorities have been taken from their homes and placed into camps. 500,000 minors have been separated from families, and thousands more fled. Families have been torn apart, homes and livelihoods taken, and all religious and cultural symbols removed. I have only linked impartial reports below, but many are reported to have died, with stories of torture, abuse and worse in the tens of thousands. The CCP has explained this as re-education and anti-terrorism measures, but to the Uighur people, it is the removal of their identity.
Separatism is an oft-cited defence of the CCP’s actions, an explanation for a history of violence in the region. May I reiterate that there is NO justification for ethnic cleansing; to punish all Uighurs for separatism is to target them by ethnicity. You cannot tell me that children, mothers, grandmothers and all other loved ones are guilty of a shared crime. I may also add that drawing parallels to Western abuses of power is unhelpful; they are ALL examples of abuse. Again, I would like to take separatist politics out of it –have your view on whether the CCP should act or not – but there is no denying that THESE actions are disproportionate, indiscriminate and inhumane.
Many of us around the world feel helpless to act; unlike other protests, petitions to China fall on deaf ears and protests drown in the upheaval the world is experiencing. I would ask you, if nothing else, to share these stories so people are aware.
Petition and Protest your government – the CCP may not listen but force your government to. Many have made symbolic gestures – force them to take direct action. I cannot share petitions here for validity sake but share them in the comments.
NGO’s: Amnesty, MSF, The Red Cross and Crescent have proven records: these NGO’s take no sides except that of the victim. If you cannot act, them all your support so they can. Again, share more (verified NGO’s) in the comments.
To remain silent is NOT to remain neutral – it is to choose the side of the oppressor. Posts not only spread awareness; they remind those of us who care that we are not alone.

Since the topic of societies is booming, let's give some praise and support for the cultural societies, especially the smaller socieities like the Filipino, Mayanmar, Bengali, Brunei and all the cultural societies for that matter! Many cultural societies are widely inclusive, providing a space, community and a home from those missing their home and/or for those wanting to learn about other people's cultures and traditions! Although some societies may have their own problems with inclusiveness, let us not forget the importance of cultural societies at the university! I understand it maybe daunting for a person not from a certain culture to participate in these societies but I will vouch for myself that the societies try the absolute best to not exclude anyone regardless of their background or identity! A certain society may not be inclusive but there are many other societies out there who will welcome you! Don't forget to support the smaller societies! ❤","#leedsfess22669

Everyone's being told to be careful of Corona by the government. The responsibility for keeping the country safe is being put on us, which means we will also be blamed for a 2nd wave. Whether you support Boris or not, the government is ultimately responsible for this crisis because they have the experts. Me and my GCSE in science doesn't equip me to ""be alert"" of an invisible virus. Yes, don't be a bellend and have a house party but when pubs open going for a sensible pint doesn't mean you are responsible for another wave.

But the worst part is when you let it affect other people. Sure if you wanna do that to yourself then go ahead, but yesterday like lots of other people I was queueing to get my new keys and these guys behind me were smoking weed the whole 45 mins I was there and I couldn't breathe. The smell knocks me sick. I felt so stuck because obviously I needed to get my keys so couldn't leave the queue. I know you thought you looked cool. Honestly you were really attractive guys but as soon as you lit up and started acting like prats, you instantly put me off and I know I'm not alone on this. If you're gonna use drugs them fine, but don't put others in that position with you.","#leedsfess22642

I understand there must be fear to speak out even in the UK but I strongly believe we need to stand up against the CCP and with the people of Hong Kong. Perhaps through demonstrations on campus.
This is also of great importance as the CCP is getting a greater hold of uni’s here in the UK and forcing universities to do their bidding, which i encourage others to research.","#leedsfess22641

I no longer feel I am in danger of being abused and have been in this situation for many years before uni after the abuse stopped however coming home at the end of uni is making it harder to readjust to the situation, especially now I've processed it for what it was. I've not told anyone else in my family or even spoken about it with my abuser out of fear that I somehow made it up (my flashbacks and memories are still a bit hazy) but I do have friends who I can talk to. Does anyone have any advice for addressing your abuser and if this is even a good idea or would just cause more drama and hurt? Also how do you know if your abuser may put someone else at risk or if you were just a one off? Whilst I know this a very difficult topic to discuss on Fb any advice or web links would be greatly appreciated as looking through all the information still triggers me after all this time.

A love (ish) letter to my first uni room:
First of all thank you for being home this past year. You’ve allowed to have a taste of true adulthood and for that I can only ever thank you. However, this year you have been the backdrop of my declining mental health. You were claustrophobic at times (so many times) and sometimes I wanted to be anywhere but here. The flat mates I shared with were not people I got on with, and at times actively hated some of them. It made me feel really alone, stuck and unable to breath. But with the help with the friend upstairs and a couple of other pals I could handle you, know I had other places to go, to stay that wasn’t with you.
Now it’s my last couple of days before I hand you over to your new occupant, a new fresher to enjoy you as their home and I can’t help but I feel a little upset. You gave me new freedoms that I couldn’t have dreamt of two years ago and now I’m leaving you behind. My love/hate relationship with you will stick with me and as I prepare to move into a new room, in a house with people I love, I can’t help but wonder what’s in store for you. More breakdowns? A blossoming relationship? Who knows. But what I do know is this. I will miss you but I can’t wait to leave you behind.
Sincerely,

This post is going to get a lot of hatred, and I’ve resigned myself to that. I don’t know if Leedsfess will even post this. But I am currently very concerned about the political discourse in this country, and I believe others are too.
I voted Conservative in the general election. My suspicion is that if I stood up in front of LUU and announced as such, I would not be very popular to say the least. I appreciate that Leeds, especially university campus, is a very heavily left-leaning environment. I have lots of friends who would never even dream of entertaining ideas that come from the right, and we get along perfectly well. I’m also not one of those idiots who says things like “it’s harder to come out as Tory than it is to come out as gay”. However, what concerns me is the current demonisation of certain political ideologies and viewpoints that is rapidly spreading from uni campuses to the outside world.
I’m not about to come out in defence of every single right-wing policy, but I believe that there is currently a massive hatred of those with right-leaning political opinions. I cannot count the number of times that I have seen or heard students seriously tossing around comments like “if you voted Tory you’re evil” or “Tory voters are responsible for every bad thing in the world” or “how can you vote Tory and not be a racist?”. I’m not really offended by most of these comments (believe me, I know there are much more offensive things to hear), but it is difficult to hear when you’re genuinely not someone like that, and it is symptomatic of this growing culture of hatred for almost anyone who does not hold a left-wing viewpoint.
Voting Conservative is not an indication of far-right fascism, xenophobia, elitism or racism, it’s a mainstream political viewpoint, as we have seen from the millions of people who voted them in. It’s pretty likely that one of your mates did so, even if they didn’t say anything. And this is precisely why.
My general point is, even if you don’t like the ideas espoused by those on the right at all, it’s quite healthy to hear conflicting viewpoints; and it’s necessary to talk more openly about these things rather than throwing around accusations of being evil. This goes for all political viewpoints, by the way. I wish I didn’t have to say these things on an anonymous platform, but as I mentioned before it wouldn’t exactly make me popular if I proclaimed this on campus.
Hearing different viewpoints (and being friends with those who have different viewpoints) is absolutely crucial, and at the moment I feel that we are in danger of losing that. Social media sites in particular show us how careful you have to be in order that you don’t say The Wrong Things; things which, a great deal of the time, are fairly innocuous and supported by much of the population. A culture that aligns itself to a single viewpoint and abuses those who do not conform is not a healthy one.
I’ve seen people lose friendships over political views (I’m not counting things like racism or homophobia here, if you’re wondering), and it’s not nice. I would just like to implore people to have sensible conversations if they disagree politically, rather than spitting hatred at each other. I’m sure that we do not want our kids to grow up in an environment where they are afraid to express their opinions to their friends.","#leedsfess22625

CW // Abuse, gaslighting, sexual assault, r*pe
This is to those who deep uncomfortable with their friends who are misogynistic etc.
I moved to leeds and started dating a guy. It moved pretty quickly, I became friends with his housemates and friends etc. As time progressed I realised my independence was disappearing, I tried to go to my house more but when I did it would be a problem, I suffered heavily with my mental health often getting confused with what I wanted because of my partner and what he would say at the time. My mental health had got to one of the scariest points that I hadn't experienced yet, where I just needed someone to hold me. The way I was feeling was stronger than the sadness I felt before. There were alot of times he would verbally abuse me and get really angry, tell me he would drag me out of my house if I didn't go to his house, he called the police on me saying that I was trying to kill myself when I said I wasn't going to, he did this at his house where his housemates could and did see me have to get into a police van and not know why. I asked one of his housemates if he was mentally abusing me and she was like 'its just how he is, its hard for him to learn' after realising the relationship was damaging me making me lose pretty much the life I started in leeds for this guy and his friends, he made me take the morning after pill about 7 times because that's when he chose to cum in me, he would listen to asmr and get off on it with me asleep next to him, he would touch me in my sleep, he would carry on fucking me when I didn't want it. After he decided to break up with me when he went home for summer, he still messaged me abuse every day but trying to keep me around, eventually sent me more than 25,000 words in separate notes ( which I have saved) of him trying to compliment and get me back, when really it was twisted and manipulative.
This guy that everyone is 'friends' with,
None of you want this uncomfortable conversation because you know you're still friends and tolerate an abuser, even when being addressed.","#leedsfess22623

First of all, thank you Leedsfess community for being (mostly) so positive, inclusive and wholesome ❤ I've been having quite a tough time lately, and reading some posts here and the comments is giving me the strength to deal with it and work on myself. Which brings me to the question: does anybody have any suggestions about good therapists in Leeds? It's my first time seeking help, so I don't even know where to start or what to look for. I guess I'd just like someone friendly who would listen and take me seriously. I think I might feel more confortable with a woman and with someone who's first language is not English (since many of my issues come from either one of those things), but it's not that important, as long as they let me feel safe and understood.
(I've been to the Uni counselling and it didn't quite work for me, I think I need a more specific, consistent and ""personalised"" approach). Also, it goes without saying, the cheaper the better 😅
If anybody has had good experiences with their therapist, know someone who they like and trust, or have any other suggestion/advice in general, please comment here. Thank you 💞","#leedsfess22621

CW // Sexual assault
Reply to #22557, I am also in the same position as you. I was sexually assaulted by someone on my course, thankfully I had supporting friends who helped me report it to the police. The university knew about this but took around a week to reach out to me, this meant I saw my abuser in my lectures which caused panic attacks. I barely attended university that week, until finally the university reached out to me and limited how me and him will ‘bump’ into each other. I have gone through such a bad experience with how the university handled my situation, not only did they not reach out to me quickly but their lack of response and care for such victims absolutely baffles me. When my advisor and head of student cases did not reply to me for over 3 weeks, and I have multiple emails and call receipts to prove their lack of communication, I was actually even blamed by an LUU worker who I reached out to for help that it was actually ME who was not responding and she continued to defend the university. There’s a lot more I have to say about the university and how they’ve treated me, but it involves the higher committee board and it scares me the lack of compassion they show assault victims. I was actually told that ‘2 months is enough time’ between the assault and exams to basically not be affected. When I say the university only cares about their reputation and only sees us as walking piles of money, I really mean it. If you look at some other universities, they have a whole website for just assault victims. I think it’s up to us to try and voice how little support there is, because if you don’t like councelling then university pretty much can’t offer you anything else. I’ve always felt more listened to by those who can relate to me, and it’s helpful to hear how others have dealt with their trauma.","#leedsfess22619

And a PSA for those who think “younger people will be alright” - no, the whole point of a novel disease is not knowing the long term consequences, I’ve already seen younger people with reduced lung function as a result of this despite having very mild symptoms.

Poem
Life gave me lemons, and I made lemonade
A library I climbed and a hero I was made
Legendary as it was, I knew I’d been played
As I went on social media to see my stunt displayed
As trouble arrived, I needn’t worry, I knew I could count on the kindness of Leeds Uni
Banned from the library, with a helluva a fine,
I knew it would be best to lay low some time
But I knew the months of silence would never last
Reminiscing on the fame I had in the past
It made me who I am, for that I am proud
I’ll return to Hyde Park to sing it out loud
Now here I am, so far from Leeds and lonely
Knowing Eddy B library will always own me
Can’t wait to return to the place where it began
Yours sincerely, Leeds Spider-Man
Ps: Leedsfess #22547 - I’m doing very well. Going into second year. Shakas bro.","#leedsfess22609

CW // Sexual assault, r*pe
A few weeks before lockdown, I was seeing a boy for a couple of weeks. We went out one night and he stayed at mine, we had sex and we went to sleep. At around 6, I woke up to him holding my hips and trying to put his penis inside of me whilst I was asleep. I squirmed away and then went back to sleep. When we woke up later, I said to him that what he did wasn’t right and made me really uncomfortable. He said he couldn’t remember it, apologised and then begged me not to tell anyone so I didn’t. At the time I didn’t want to think about it because I was embarrassed and it made me feel so icky, so I didn’t tell anyone. I saw him again and tried to bring it up how it made me feel gross, but he shouted at me and asked why I was bringing it up when he’d already apologised, so I dropped it. Looking back at it, I think it was quite bad what he did to me? And I feel stupid for not kicking up more of a fuss, I just felt and still feel really confused as to whether it counts as sexual assault because we had had sex a few hours before or whatever, idk because if it was then I feel stupid for speaking to him still after (even though I ended it a week later anyway)","#leedsfess22605

The Maths department strikes again!
They have just decided to disregard a 15 credit compulsory module we just completed in second year. Apparently the marks were too high and close together to differentiate and so now it will just be Pas or Fail and not count towards the final degree.
I'm sorry but am I a wasteman, grafting for a full semester on this module; doing 4 courseworks and the end of year exam replacement assessment? What makes it worse is this lecturer was the worst ever, no word of a lie. I don't get how you can be so bad at teaching content - truly baffles me. So we had to self-teach ourselves the entire semester (even his online notes were dead) only to be told our efforts mean nothing. Absolute BS. Just feels like we, as Maths students, get hard done by in every possible way. Some lecturers are awesome but definitely an arrogant aura in the decision making by the department.","#leedsfess22600

Hi guys, I'm the author of #22578. I just wanted to clear up some things I said in relation to how I describe my nationality (and how many HK people do to) and what the whole situation means to me. I was born in Hong Kong after 1997, which was when HK ceased to be British Hong Kong, so technically I am Chinese just like everyone else born after 1997. The rest of my family on the other hand were of course born before, and so are technically British-Chinese. However, we all proudly describe ourselves as just 'British'. My parents taught my brother and I English from a young age and they made an effort to instill 'British values' into our everyday life. My dad spent 10 years here in England when he served in the Army, and he describes HK as 'little Britain' (he was not aware of the TV show :)) because it truly is a melting pot of both Chinese and British culture.
This isn't just unique to me. Thousands of other HK people think the same way. We value the democracy we enjoyed under British rule and influence, but most importantly, we're willing to fight for it. We all are so incredibly grateful for everything Britain did for Hong Kong, if it was up to us, we'd still like to be part of the Commonwealth. The CCP is evil, and I've been lucky enough to know a Hong Kong that was democratic. My grandparents suffered under the Maoist regime, when millions of innocent people died during arguably the worst government created famine in human history. The CCP serves as an example as to why extreme politics should never be allowed to manifest itself within a nation. I'm praying for Hong Kong.
PS. Thank you for all the likes the other post received, it's nice to know people are sparing a thought about HK in these already troubled times.","#leedsfess22596

I have spoken to fellow Jews and know that this is not an uncommon thing for people to experience. I came to university wearing my Star of David which is the Jewish religious symbol and am now scared to wear it. I hope that people are able to educate themselves about the Jewish religion and not listen to the stereotypes you may have heard. The holocaust did happen and it sickens me that there are people out who deny it. We are all human and one race. There is no need to single any person out.

This is the first time as a POC I feel like I’ve had a platform. Stop trying to argue against something you have no experience in. It’s like trying to deny that giving birth hurts when you’ve never given birth. It’s like saying you know what having a period is like if you were born with a penis. YOU LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT RACISM. There is no argument. Racism exist in all parts of the world. We need to grow and progress not deny it’s existence.","#leedsfess22584

I'm gonna share with you the issues that societies have in Leeds. Using performance societies as a prime example, because they're the ones I have the most knowledge of.
All the members of these societies you're fab, congrats for getting into them I'm sure it was well earned. Not gonna tear you down cos you also have dreams, here's the issue tho.
1) Societies that put on such performances get awards and recognition at the Riley, which celebrates and encourages this type of behaviour. When certain shows that have whitewashed their cast get nominated for 'best show', when societies that have the same white ppl cast in their shows over and over again and then get nominated for 'most inclusive society'. That's the definition of a joke.
2) This idea that only the 'best' get to perform is BS and goes for every single society. It creates an elitist system that puts pressure on people who don't have an ""in"" in the society. Example: I went to a certain musical society. I'm by no means the greatest singer/actor/dancer. BUT upon arriving, the prod team were cold and distant towards ppl they didn't know and warm and joking with others. I noticed that the ""others"" were the same white people cast in the previous show.
3) Societies don't try to collaborate with other societies to get a diverse cast/ members. As it has been said, there are 30 000 students (or so) in Leeds, are you seriously gonna say none of the students who auditioned were Poc of talent?! And if there are none, which I doubt, why aren't you actively advertising to culture societies?!
We all know uni culture is all about knowing people. But by casting the same white people you discourage people who have the talent to join the society and represent their culture. They don't come to activities and you find yourself in a situation where you get called out for not being diverse enough, like this one.
Make a fucking change. I'm tired of escaping systemic racism by seeing musicals and plays only to find out its made its way to our stages. Make a change, we're watching you.","#leedsfess22582

The Communist government is restricting the Hong Kong people's rights concerning freedom of speech, assembly and association. You can now be arrested for playing any pro-British anthems and you can be punished for even describing yourself as British. Any anti-government speech is also prohibited... My family and I describe ourselves as British, like so many other people from HK, I'd really appreciate if you guys would consider donating or even writing to some of the many charities and action groups helping the Hong Kong people.

Does anyone who is shielding feel extremely let down by all their friends going around fucking hugging everyone they see and basically just trying to get as close as possible to strangers at every opportunity? Lockdown is over for practically everyone now, so it’s really funny seeing people do this shit when there’s still a very real possibility I could die from this. They’re talking of a second wave in August now, right when I will no longer have to shield. It’s clearly the governments fault for lifting restrictions too early (practically all virologists say it is too early) but when people you know well can’t even make tiny sacrifices to give me a chance at some sort of normal life eventually really pisses me off. However having said all this at the same time I’m conflicted, part of me wants people to just mingle as much as possible so we can get some natural immunity going.

Many have already signed for houses under the assumption that term would start as normal in September and will miss out financially. No other UK universities have taken this kind of action and it contradicts strongly with undergraduates returning in September.

How do we all feel about the term BAME (black, asian, minority ethnic)? Obviously, people from various minority ethnic backgrounds have similarities in their experiences, but they can also be wildly different. Many are arguing that BAME is too reductionist. For example, in 2015/16, the percentage of black caribbean pupils attaining A* to C in English and Maths GCSE was 51%, whereas for black Africans it was 63% (both from the black category). And then for Indian students it was 77%, and for Pakistani students it was 58% (both from the asian category). This is just one example, but there are many many more out there. The race disparity audit is a good place to investigate differences in experience among minority ethnic groups.
I'm sure many people have seen the headline 'BAME students make up one-fifth of new Oxford Undergraduates'. But how many of these BAME students are black? How many are eastern asian? southern asian? ""The proportion of UK-domiciled students admitted to Oxford who indicate in their UCAS application that they identify as Asian has risen from 6.4% in 2015 to 9.6% in 2019"", those that ""identify as Bangladeshi or Pakistani [have] risen from 0.7% in 2015 to 2.1% in 2019"", those that ""identify as Black [have] risen from 1.5% in 2015 to 3.2% in 2019.""
The term BAME hides these differences. For example, Oxford university could truthfully say 1/5 of their students are BAME, but in reality it could mean 85% of these students were Chinese, 10% were southern asian and 5% were black (I've just made this up but you can see how even though there's massive differences between groups, they can all be conveniently lumped into one group).
Personally, I think terms like BAME are a ""one size fits all"" approach. It's important to recognise the differences as well as the similarities in the experiences of different minority ethnic groups. Anti-black racism exists. Anti-Asian racism exists (and that affects Eastern and southern Asians differently). And they exist in different amounts too.
No, this is not divisive. Deconstructing BAME is not an attempt to sever the ties between minority ethnic groups. It's an attempt to recognise the differences we often ignore when we assume all minority ethnic people experience the same things because they have the commonality of not being white. Obviously, this is not true. Sure, BAME is a very handy acronym. But I'm interested in whether people think it's reductiveness is more apparent than its ""usefulness""??

There's already been plenty of LeedsFess' outlining how shit students treat Hyde Park, but this is aimed directly at the selfishness, ignorance and stupidity shown by many returning this week. LeedsFess has a gigantic following now and I am writing this to hopefully make a lot of the students, whether you are Uni of, Beckett, Leeds Arts or more, realise how idiotic they are being simply for their enjoyment.
A significant portion of Leeds students check this daily, so call out the cunts breaking social distancing JUST so they can ping in their garden with a few tinnies and a ton of their mates (plus from what I've heard, terrible taste in Liquid DnB)
Currently, my family and more are all having to shield. Due to this, I was stuck up in Leeds for months alone, trying to work out ways to get home safely and not put my family at risk. I see tons of student’s flock back to Leeds and the overall sights are disgusting.
Do half of you twats (anyone who went to a house party the past week is a twat, will not even apologise) not have any care for the millions still shielding and more that this pandemic has affected. That you just MUST host gigantic house parties, which no regard for social distancing? Add alcohol and social distancing will not be enforced by these students alone, so you cannot say ""we were being safe and 2m"" it's blatantly a lie.
Do not use the excuse, I am graduating and will not get to see these people for ages. Do not use the excuse, I have just been bored at home with my parents ugh. Who fucking cares? People are dying and their friends and families will never get to see them again, so maybe grow up and realise you don't have to snort ket with your mate from Surrey you've known for 2 years because you miss the sesh. IF ANYTHING, YOU DID NOT NEED TO RETURN TO LEEDS AT ALL YET?
Think. How many students have moved back from all over the country turning Hyde Park into a literal melting pot of Corona? The park alone is scary to witness. We are not through the pandemic at all yet, regardless of what BoJo tries to say. With 30+ people in houses/gardens drinking as if the entire world is not mid-crisis. The Pubs reopening or other lockdown measures being relaxed is not an excuse for you have gigantic parties with your uni mates because ""we're outside so it doesn't matter"". Sure, when you are centimetres away from each other packed in like main floor Fruity, Corona deffo won't be passed between you at all...
As proof. Lots of people I once thought were intelligent and my friends, I've since seen posting Instagram stories of house parties. Which, unless you live in a house of 30, is not just your household. Take a hard look at yourselves, doubt you'll like what you see. Just have some respect.
My rant is over. Peace.","#leedsfess22563
There's already been plenty of LeedsFess' outlining how shit students treat Hyde Park, but this is aimed directly at the selfishness, ignorance and stupidity shown by many returning this week. LeedsFess has a gigantic following now and I am writing this to hopefully make a lot of the students, whether you are Uni of, Beckett, Leeds Arts or more, realise how idiotic they are being simply for their enjoyment.
A significant portion of Leeds students check this daily, so call out the cunts breaking social distancing JUST so they can ping in their garden with a few tinnies and a ton of their mates (plus from what I've heard, terrible taste in Liquid DnB)
Currently, my family and more are all having to shield. Due to this, I was stuck up in Leeds for months alone, trying to work out ways to get home safely and not put my family at risk. I see tons of student’s flock back to Leeds and the overall sights are disgusting.
Do half of you twats (anyone who went to a house party the past week is a twat, will not even apologise) not have any care for the millions still shielding and more that this pandemic has affected. That you just MUST host gigantic house parties, which no regard for social distancing? Add alcohol and social distancing will not be enforced by these students alone, so you cannot say ""we were being safe and 2m"" it's blatantly a lie.

This is a hard post to write but some time back I was sexually assaulted and it has really affected me mentally and physically to this day. After speaking to my friends about it I found out that 80% of my friends had the same or similar experience. I want to do something about this so that the university can perhaps create a ‘#metoo’ safe space so students can talk about their experience and not have to feel embarrassed or scared (in private of course). This is really important to me as I feel like the university needs to become more aware of this issue that affects many men and women to this day! I’m posting this as I need some advice on how to start? Should I email the university or the student union? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.","#22557

It’s funny to me how in primary school, kids would mock me for being Chinese by pulling their eyes into slits but now I see TikTok tutorials on how to make your eyes look higher and slimmer.
It’s funny to me how I once heard someone say ‘do they think they’re too good to breathe the same air as us?’ when an Asian student in a mask walked by, but now you wear masks to protect yourself from infection.
It’s funny to me how people say we should be thankful to live in the UK and that our attitudes are rude, but then sexualise Ao Dai’s, which have significant cultural heritage.
Unfortunately, there’s still a line between what’s acceptable for a culture in the UK and what’s not, and that line is drawn by white people. Maybe without always realising it, I admit, but the systematic bias is still there.
People will pick what they like about us and make it benefit them, then criticise us for celebrating our culture, telling us to go ‘back to where we came from’.
We’re called Ch*nks and mocked for our eyes, but now it’s ok because it’s stylised. We wore masks to protect ourselves from infection and were told we’re elitist but now it’s ok because it protects everyone. We were told your dresses were an appreciation for our culture, but you tarnish the meaning behind our cultural dress.
We are not a fashion trend for when it suits you. Stop your performative activism and give us the equality and the respect we deserve.","#22554

TW//Sexual Assault
Last year my boyfriend at the time sexually assaulted me (I think). We’d had a drink and he started trying things when we were in bed. I really hate sex whilst I’m drunk because of a traumatic previous experience, and he knew this. I tried to stop him verbally at first and he kept going, putting his hands down my pants and kissing my neck when I wouldn’t kiss him back so I had to physically push him off of me. He stopped after that and went to sleep. I felt off around him for a few days afterwards and eventually brought it up, to which he said he couldn’t remember it happening but he did actually apologise for it and so I tried to forget about it.
We dated for maybe 3/4 months after this but we didn’t actually do anything sexual. I still thought we were happy and blamed other things for the lack of sex. We broke up eventually (he cheated on me lol) but we stayed friends because we got on well and had a lot in common.
But lately, I’ve been rethinking everything and should I really have forgiven him just because he was drunk and said sorry? Should I talk to him about it again even though it happened last year? I kinda just needed to get this off of my chest because I’ve seen a lot of people speaking out lately, and also because I really could do with any advice at all :(","#22553

pls give non-dickish advice. basically, ages ago I was slaughtered on a a night out and woke up the next morning in someone else’s bed. I didn’t have any clothes on, my phone was dead and the person I was with informed me that I’d lost my keys. my mates have had different opinions about the situation. some have said it was really dodgy, that I was so drunk I had no idea where I met this person or when/if I agreed to go home with them and I literally have no idea if we slept together or not. other mates have just sort of acted like it was a normal one night stand and we’ve like laughed about it. but the more I think about it, the more I don’t think it was okay? I don’t usually black out or get bad hangovers so I must have been exceptionally drunk and definitely not able to consent to anything? also this person knew that I had no way of getting into my room so they knew I was vulnerable?

To the friends of the boys who screamed ‘fucking slags’ at us from the roof of their campus accommodation, please ask your mates why it’s acceptable to treat women like this. Ask them why when we retaliated they continued to hurl abuse.
Sexual harassment at the hands of men is a constant presence in women’s lives. Ask the men in your life if they’ve ever said something like these boys said, ever thought it was ‘just banter’ - heads up, this wasn’t the only time we were sexually harassed by male students that day, so it’s probably more common than you think. Don’t take your judgement on the scale of this situation as a given.
Ask yourself why maybe you find yourself not grasping why catcalling/ verbal sexual harassment is more than a nuisance to women and is actually a threatening presence in our lives. Ask yourself how verbal sexual harassment relates to other symbolic and physical violence perpetrated against women by men on a daily basis: from micro aggressions in the workplace to sexual abuse and assault, and so on. Ask yourself why you’ve not done the research to see the bigger picture. Ask yourself if you’re taking pause to LISTEN to the women in your life about these experiences they’re having. Ask yourself if you’re taking the time to understand the ever present effect this potential and actual violence has on our behaviour, from what kind of clothes we’ll wear if we’ll be walking alone to the route we’ll take.
To the friends of those guys who thought it was okay to shout what they did and to the rest of you, please take this as a call to action to speak to your friends about their behaviour and to reflect on your own - maybe you’ll stop more women being sexually harassed or assaulted/ abused. Because idk about you, but I’m pretty fucking sick of it.
To the women reading this post I’m sorry this is a constant fucking feature of our lives and I’m sorry if anything here was triggering for you. I don’t know a single woman who hasn’t experienced harassment, I hardly know a single women who hasn’t experienced some form of sexual assault. We see you and we stand with you.","#22545

As it’s almost time housing tenancies start, I thought I’d give some advice from personal experience on how to avoid making a mess of setting up bills yourself.
First things first, I’d say only go bills separately if your group are the following:
1. People who want to save money (obvious but if your parents are paying then it won’t be as big a deal for you)
2. People who are proactive and committed to the extra hassle
3. People who don’t mind calling up companies😅 (optional)
This is because without motivation, nothing will get sorted on time, you’ll rack up big delay charges plus you won’t find the best deals. So a couple of tips:
* Set up bills in July, don’t wait until you’ve moved in fully in September:
Energy companies can charge you whatever they like from the start of the contract until you’re set up (ie. high standing charges) so have a look at comparison websites ASAP
* Share the responsibility:
Get a different person to set up each bill (water, gas & electric, broadband & TV) This means one person doesn’t become the villain asking for payments each month; additionally you can ask the others to set up standing orders to the bill payer so there’s no nagging.
In summary, don’t be assholes in order to shy away from responsibility, you’re all in it together. Also, don’t worry about being too firm at the beginning of the tenancy, it saves the hassle for the rest of it.","#22542
As it’s almost time housing tenancies start, I thought I’d give some advice from personal experience on how to avoid making a mess of setting up bills yourself.
First things first, I’d say only go bills separately if your group are the following:
1. People who want to save money (obvious but if your parents are paying then it won’t be as big a deal for you)
2. People who are proactive and committed to the extra hassle
3. People who don’t mind calling up companies😅 (optional)
This is because without motivation, nothing will get sorted on time, you’ll rack up big delay charges plus you won’t find the best deals. So a couple of tips:
* Set up bills in July, don’t wait until you’ve moved in fully in September:

Response to #22479 I am a member of a Leeds uni performance society and I cannot disagree that membership is overwhelmingly white and a more concerted effort to increase diversity absolutely needs to be implemented in the coming year. The same can be said for a lot of other societies with different interests. Societies are a microcosm of the more general interests they represent and sadly they exhibit how deeply rooted white privilege is in many of the extracurricular, perhaps ‘luxury’ activities that many people are not able to take part in growing up. I hope to see change come September.","#22540

In reply to #22479, saying ‘oh well societies are voluntary’ yes that’s a fair enough point however, I think you may need to think about WHY poc aren't joining your society. If you are looking to join a society and everyone in it is white is that really a welcoming environment or are you just going to be seen as the ‘token POC’. As someone in a sport society the number of times on nights out I have heard vulgar and demeaning language used against POC is actually disgusting and if you call it out (which myself and my fellow team mates do) people tell you to chill because it’s ‘just a joke’ and ‘how you can’t say anything anymore’. Similarly I have heard a theatre girl say that she was glad the girl she was up against (who was biracial) didn’t get the part because she ‘didn’t fit the look’. It’s these aggressions that lead to your society being less diverse and seen as welcoming. If that’s too hard to understand then think of it as only having a straight society where no one is LGBTQ+, if you look to join will you be seen as the token gay/trans/non binary person, will you be welcomed or will people only want to be around you because they’ve watch ru paul and just loveeeee gays? It’s finding a way in which to make your society more approachable and diverse, be it by talking to religious societies (that aren’t white dominated) and poc societies to get a better understanding of how to achieve this, getting a better understanding yourself about the stigmas that’s poc students feel and face at Leeds. At the end of the day your society may still remain undiverse simply because it’s not the one poc students want to join, but by just saying ‘well we’re voluntary so can’t do anything about it’ isn’t enough in this day and age, learn things about new cultures and backgrounds so you can have a better understanding and idea of perhaps why your society is lacking diversity and how it can try to change that.","#22537

To the people in the comments who STILL don’t understand the definition of racism: first of all, if you’re white please stop trying to define it for us POC. It’s prejudice plus power and we know that because we deal with it every. Fucking. Day.
‘Personal racism’ is not a thing. What you’re referring to is prejudice, which I am not denying is hurtful, but it is not backed up by a SYSTEM that is built to oppress based on race. Racism, on the other hand, is when the system is built to back up these prejudices at every level of society. Each personal account of racism from a POC is a manifestation of this system. Racism IS institutional, so please stop using it interchangeably when talking about prejudice that isn’t perpetuated by a system.
To the white people who say it’s not their fault oppression bingo is a thing: it is your fault. Those of you who rabbit “wHaT aBoUt wHiTe wOrKiNg cLaSs pEoPLe?”, do you think that working class POC don’t exist? And why do you only seem to care about white working class people in this scenario, when their class oppression is suddenly useful to you? Don’t use them as a device to gaslight POC when they’re trying to talk about their experiences of racism, it’s fucking gross.
Oh, and one last thing. To those of you who keep bringing up South Africa as some bullshit reverse racism talking point: STOP glossing over apartheid and acting like it happened ages ago when it only ended in the 1990s. To ignore the effects of it as though it isn’t within living memory is not only foolish, it’s dangerous and dismissive too.","#22532

The UK is not innocent. The British Empire committed a plethora of inhumane crimes, ranging from slavery to native genocide, across the globe.
Your taxes have been used to pay off the reparations given to slaveowners after the abolishment of slavery. But former colonies continue to pay for the actions of their colonial rulers.
For example, Haiti fought and won a war for their independence in 1804. Then in 1825 France forced Haiti to pay THEM reparations for the loss of “property”. The reparations are estimated to be worth US $21 BILLION today. You can imagine how a small fledging nation like Haiti struggled under the enormity of such a crushing debt. Haiti was not able to pay off the loan (including interest!) used for the reparations until 1947. However, they continue to suffer from the repercussions of France’s actions today and remain one of the poorest countries in the world.
Haiti is not the only country that continues to suffer from the legacies of colonialism. Former colonies continue to be stuck in an endless cycle of poverty. Britain and other imperial nations stole the wealth and resources of their colonies to develop their own economies. This put the development of former colonies at a historic disadvantage. So, while former slaveowners were able to leave behind wealth for their children, former slaves were only able to leave behind poverty.
Slavery has been acknowledged as a crime against humanity, but colonial rulers, like Britain, have yet to issue a formal apology, much less acknowledge their role in native genocide. This is part of why the BLM movement is so important. People of African descendant have historically suffered at the hands of white colonialists and the systems they put in place across the globe.
Colonialism has been shown to have generational ramifications across the world. This leads me to two important conclusions: the movement for reparatory justice and decolonising the curriculum. Reparations for former colonies will never erase what happened but it can go a long way to help develop former colonies. CARICOM created a 10-point plan for reparatory justice and the first step is a formal apology for slavery and colonialism. Decolonising the curriculum is also an incredibly important step forward. I am not trying to shame you for being the passive beneficiaries of colonialism, but we need to acknowledge how we have benefitted and continue to benefit from the legacies of colonialism.
To start with, we need to hold our institutions accountable. University of Glasgow pledged £20 million in reparations last year after discovering how they have benefitted from the slave trade. The Leeds universities should follow their example and investigate how they have benefitted from slavery and atone for these actions.
Furthermore, we need to demand the UK government issue an apology for slavery. It is incredibly embarrassing that this has not happened yet, and they continue to act as if black and brown communities around the world do not still suffer from the legacies of colonialism.
We will never be able to undo the past, but we can work together for a better future.

So, while former slaveowners were able to leave behind wealth for their children, former slaves were only able to leave behind poverty.
Slavery has been acknowledged as a crime against humanity, but colonial rulers, like Britain, have yet to issue a formal apology, much less acknowledge their role in native genocide. This is part of why the BLM movement is so important. People of African descendant have historically suffered at the hands of white colonialists and the systems they put in place across the globe.
Colonialism has been shown to have generational ramifications across the world. This leads me to two important conclusions: the movement for reparatory justice and decolonising the curriculum. Reparations for former colonies will never erase what happened but it can go a long way to help develop former colonies. CARICOM created a 10-point plan for reparatory justice and the first step is a formal apology for slavery and colonialism. Decolonising the curriculum is also an incredibly important step forward. I am not trying to shame you for being the passive beneficiaries of colonialism, but we need to acknowledge how we have benefitted and continue to benefit from the legacies of colonialism.
To start with, we need to hold our institutions accountable. University of Glasgow pledged £20 million in reparations last year after discovering how they have benefitted from the slave trade. The Leeds universities should follow their example and investigate how they have benefitted from slavery and atone for these actions.
Furthermore, we need to demand the UK government issue an apology for slavery. It is incredibly embarrassing that this has not happened yet, and they continue to act as if black and brown communities around the world do not still suffer from the legacies of colonialism.
We will never be able to undo the past, but we can work together for a better future.

To people that have periods: please consider a menstrual cup.
I've been using them for 2 years now and have really got to understand the benefits of them in comparison to tampons and pads.
I understand they're not for everyone but they definitely have a lot of good qualities! For example:
- They usually only need changing in the morning and before bed (a lot less maintenance than alternatives)
- They're reusable. Most can last from 5-10 years. THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU CAN SAVE! One cup costs £20 but just think of it as a long term investment. Also this means they are way better for the environment too! It's a win-win!
- They're better for your body. Tampons are often bleached meaning chemicals are entering your bodies and harming them! By using a cup there are less toxic substances going into your body, leading to less chance of infections!
- They reduce the chance of toxic shock syndrome
- You can still go swimming when you wear a cup! In fact, you're less likely to leak using a cup than a tampon
- People worry about not being able to insert the cup properly but it is a lot easier than it seems! It's a very flexible material and sometimes it just takes a little practice at first and getting used to - trust me!

As the ardest cunt animal on the planet, the honey badger would fight you, and your dad for fuck all and win. Seriously. These bastards can take the bite of a snake while ripping it's insides out and get drunk off its venom. It's a madness! They've got the bravery of a... well a fuckin honey badger m8, comparing it to another animal's is downright insulting you lil BITCH. They will take on 6 lions at once at the size of of meerkat with sheer attitude alone, whilst you can't take on one at the size of a PUSSYOLE! And don't mess with no momma honey badger. Oh HELLLL no. If a leapord snatches it's young to eat, the honey badger simply tells that dumbfuck to give it back, and the leapord (simply knowing the consequences if it doesn't) will give the baby back and its own young for the hassle, without hesitation. The honey badger then blows up the pathetic leapord-spawn with its mind lol. And if it were possible, they would be awarded the highest rank that the army can offer: a Stone Island badge.
In conclusion do not fuck with the honey badger, or my passion for them.
Also if you understand this code's meaning you're a top 2 tier mammal, just beneath the honey badger:

So despite us filling in required forms, the uni moved our belongings out of our rooms and into store rooms. Roommates have gone back to collect and found rooms bare and only a few items in store rooms, so looks like people are treating it as a free for all. Pretty disgusted at how poorly the uni has handled this situation- not all of us can afford to replace stuff at the drop of a hat.
Also if you're stealing from store rooms you're human scum 😇","#22427

I am white, and I have a friend. I live with them, they’re also white, but their partner is black.
At the moment, with the current political climate, my friend is posting all about BLM and encouraging people to donate to charities which is obviously great.
However, the way they act behind the back of their partner is so hurt fully racist.
On multiple occasions they’ve used the word “slave” to describe their partner when making them do simple tasks for them. Even though their black partner is the guest, my friend makes them do these tasks even though it’s their flat and they’re their belongings. Plus everyone knows, if you’re hosting, you clean up. It’s basic manners.
And on one other occasion they used the N word to describe their black partner too. This was because they weren’t doing something they thought they should be doing.
I’d hate to think that they can use these racist terms just because they’re in a relationship with a black person. But because I know this person and the type of personality they have, I do believe they think they can use these terms in a casual setting and have it be okay.
When it most definitely is NOT okay AT ALL.
To make it worse, my friend has also said “don’t tell (them) I said that, because (they) don’t know I call (them) that.”
Which shows they know what they’re saying would upset their partner and they want to actively hide it.
As an outsider I don’t want to intrude on a relationship I am not involved in. However, part of me wants to tell my friends partner because they way my friend acts with them in general is hurtful and hard to witness.
I want to help, and I want to inform my friends partner, but I don’t know if it’s my place to get involved. Especially with the fact that me and my friend have a history of falling out.
I am torn between an anger for my friends behaviour and a fear of meddling. Please help 😅","#22426

In light of the sheer volume of ignorance I’ve seen in the comments on posts of personal experiences made by POC, I’m choosing to address you all at once right here. As you have so much time to comment your bullshit on this very page, I’m sure you’ve got the time to read these words. It also stops you from receiving the individual attention that you so obviously crave by leaving your controversial (read: racist) garbage for POC to deal with. Again.
So, here’s another post on white privilege. For the billionth time, it does NOT mean your life has been as smooth sailing as Dominic Cummings escaping any kind of consequences for his quarantine-breaking trip to Durham. It literally just means that no one is going to murder you for the colour of your skin. You might STILL experience oppression at the hands of the class system, as a woman, as a member of the LGBT+ community, but as a white person you will never have to experience racism. And it’s not fucking oppression bingo: don’t act like experiencing one negates the other.
Maybe your ignorance stems from the fact that you don’t realise the system itself is racist. Remember: racism is oppression plus power. Racism is not just composed of slurs and stereotypes, it is also Britain greedily consuming the world to form its ‘glorious’ empire by looting countries of their people, erasing their culture, stealing their resources, their spices (and still having the audacity to eat plain white chicken), it would be an understatement to say that list can in no way sum up the level of these atrocities. Racism is the fact that the Britain we live in now is not so different from the Britain that enslaved people and sold them alongside cattle, it’s just taking the form of Grenfell, of Windrush, of statues of slave owners still standing in our streets. It is a curriculum that only paints Britain in a flattering light, that somehow neglects to mention that Churchill’s government was responsible for a genocide in India that killed up to three million people (among a laundry list of more atrocities), that Britain was the organiser and instigator of the chattel slave trade. It is people saving their outrage for a metal statue of Edward Colston is thrown in the harbour he traded slaves from, when the same people stayed silent as black lives were taken away on our streets. The list, again, goes on.
And I am sick and tired of people feigning ignorance and hiding behind it as an excuse to be racist. Black people have already written the words, made the films, bared their trauma and you’re too lazy to read a book, watch a film, even just scroll through the Instagram accounts of black women like @dominiquedrakeford and @munroebergdorf? Lists on the best materials to become anti-racist are circulating everywhere you look - you don’t even have to find the best resources yourself! It is so, SO easy that it’s disgusting and shameful if you haven’t even tried.
If you aren’t black you don’t have to deal with the intergenerational trauma of slavery. You don’t have to deal with the risk of being killed for your skin colour. You don’t have to deal with people complaining about the possibility of admitting that hey, maybe your life DOES matter, maybe you should be allowed to exist peacefully after all.
So please, miss us POC with your games of oppression bingo. If this somehow still doesn’t compute in your head, I’ll happily smack you across the face with Reni Eddo-Lodge’s magnificent book: “Why I’m no longer talking to white people about race”.","#22423

Adding on to the leedsfess about ""No, where do you really come from"".
I have been asked where I'm from an inestimable amount of times and until I went to uni I never realized there was more than one answer. I was born in england and have lived here my whole life and therefore would reply with where I'm from in England. This was always accepted. Then at uni when I was surrounded by a larger variety of people I realized that many people replied with where they're family were from or where they were born, even if they had been raised here. My dad was not born in this country, nor were my grandparents on my mother's side and I suddenly find myself confused for the first time about how to answer that simple question. However, the point of this post is to help people understand white privilege. My family were immigrants and noone questions that I'm English and noone knows until I tell them ( and even then I have never been told that this isn't my country, possibly because the country my family came from is also predominantly white and therefore they were the ""right kind of immigrants "" ?? ). The difference is if I was black it would not have took me 18 years to learn the complexity of that question, I'd be much more likely to be asked it in the first place and then I would have to come up with a ""good enough"" answer. I cant imagine what that feels like. White people face discrimination, noone is questioning that, but this is one of many situations where just the colour of your skin can change so much and it doesnt take away from your struggles to accept that someone else has it worse.","#22413

I wanted to clarify a few things, which i thought was important ,about my confession on my experience as a BAME student.
I realised I used a poor choice of words when describing how I felt. When I said “I felt sick” I should have expanded on what I meant and explained that the feeling of sickness I experienced was the because of the dread I felt. Honestly it was because I realised I’m going to stand out In class and I’d spend the rest of my uni experience trying to hide in the back of the class so that I don’t draw attention to myself. To those who think being a minority in a classroom is not a big deal and we should “get over it” I’m shocked I have to explain myself further but I’d like to expand on how it feels. I know I’m visibly different and even though I’ve worked equally as hard as my peers I felt and still feel as though I’m inadequate and undeserving of my place. I can already predict the comments on “that’s to do with your own confidence issues”. However, this is how me and multiple minority students feel so don’t trivialise it. This led to me not always speaking up and defending BAME communities & immigrants when my peers made stereotypical comments in fear of drawing attention to myself. I should have called them out and educated them on the subject. Something which I regret and wish I did more.
Also, to the ignorant comment underneath the most which kinda left me stunned. To the one guy who thought it was funny to tag all 4 of his mates underneath the post and suggested instead of going to uni (because I have a problem with my course not being diverse) I should spend my £9000 on a night out in fruity instead and to stop complaining because the UK is a majority white country. First of all your ignorance baffles me you’re totally missing the point about my post. Secondly, Yes the UK is majority white- however institutional racism DOES EXIST and it makes it harder for BAME Students to access places or even attain a higher education. Arguing that 6 BAME students is suffice for a cohort size of 65 is not it. Something I failed to mention which would have provide better context was how there is NOT A SINGLE BLACK STUDENT on my course- I should have added that in for clarity and for people to understand why I was so upset and shocked at the lack of representation. As an asian I acknowledge that I have privilege as well- I’ve been giving the opportunity to study something I’m passionate about- i should be grateful as noone from the black community has been given the same opportunity as me and many other asians. The lack of diversity in my course is shocking FULL STOP, there is no excuse for it and no way you can justify it. Stop making excuses for it and trying to invalidate my feelings because it doesn’t fit your agenda and you’re not directly affected by racial prejudice. Secondly if you think the best way to spend £9000 is on a night out to fruity you clearly need to reconsider a few things.
Finally to the students who understood and acknowledged my feelings rather than trivialising them, thank you it meant a LOT!! It was refreshing to see students acknowledge their white privilege and educate those in the comment section. It’s nice to see so many of you use your platform to spread awareness and utilise it to enforce change! And to the students who experienced and/or are living through something similar. BE proud of your heritage and your culture. You are beautiful, smart and strong!! Yes you may have days where you’re exhausted but remember that you are equally as deserving of your place!! And to those who thought they’d trivialise my experience, don’t think white privilege exists or want to “get me a paracetamol”- you are contributing to the problem!! If a BAME student is telling you how they feel do not mock and joke about their situation- try understand why they are frustrated and feel a certain way! White privilege doesn’t mean that your life is not and hard and you’re not struggling- it means that the colour of your skin and your racial background isn’t one of the factors making it harder. You are responsible for educating yourself and becoming more ethical when it comes to these matters.
Support the black lives matter movement, understand that they are frustrated because they have been oppressed for decades under a system which targets them because of their skin colour and educate yourself on struggles ethnic minorities face- a few links to help ya out

I know I’m visibly different and even though I’ve worked equally as hard as my peers I felt and still feel as though I’m inadequate and undeserving of my place. I can already predict the comments on “that’s to do with your own confidence issues”. However, this is how me and multiple minority students feel so don’t trivialise it. This led to me not always speaking up and defending BAME communities & immigrants when my peers made stereotypical comments in fear of drawing attention to myself. I should have called them out and educated them on the subject. Something which I regret and wish I did more.
Also, to the ignorant comment underneath the most which kinda left me stunned. To the one guy who thought it was funny to tag all 4 of his mates underneath the post and suggested instead of going to uni (because I have a problem with my course not being diverse) I should spend my £9000 on a night out in fruity instead and to stop complaining because the UK is a majority white country. First of all your ignorance baffles me you’re totally missing the point about my post. Secondly, Yes the UK is majority white- however institutional racism DOES EXIST and it makes it harder for BAME Students to access places or even attain a higher education. Arguing that 6 BAME students is suffice for a cohort size of 65 is not it. Something I failed to mention which would have provide better context was how there is NOT A SINGLE BLACK STUDENT on my course- I should have added that in for clarity and for people to understand why I was so upset and shocked at the lack of representation. As an asian I acknowledge that I have privilege as well- I’ve been giving the opportunity to study something I’m passionate about- i should be grateful as noone from the black community has been given the same opportunity as me and many other asians. The lack of diversity in my course is shocking FULL STOP, there is no excuse for it and no way you can justify it. Stop making excuses for it and trying to invalidate my feelings because it doesn’t fit your agenda and you’re not directly affected by racial prejudice. Secondly if you think the best way to spend £9000 is on a night out to fruity you clearly need to reconsider a few things.
Finally to the students who understood and acknowledged my feelings rather than trivialising them, thank you it meant a LOT!! It was refreshing to see students acknowledge their white privilege and educate those in the comment section. It’s nice to see so many of you use your platform to spread awareness and utilise it to enforce change! And to the students who experienced and/or are living through something similar. BE proud of your heritage and your culture. You are beautiful, smart and strong!! Yes you may have days where you’re exhausted but remember that you are equally as deserving of your place!! And to those who thought they’d trivialise my experience, don’t think white privilege exists or want to “get me a paracetamol”- you are contributing to the problem!! If a BAME student is telling you how they feel do not mock and joke about their situation- try understand why they are frustrated and feel a certain way! White privilege doesn’t mean that your life is not and hard and you’re not struggling- it means that the colour of your skin and your racial background isn’t one of the factors making it harder. You are responsible for educating yourself and becoming more ethical when it comes to these matters.
Support the black lives matter movement, understand that they are frustrated because they have been oppressed for decades under a system which targets them because of their skin colour and educate yourself on struggles ethnic minorities face- a few links to help ya out

Just here to explain what white privilege is for those who don’t understand it or refuse to understand it. It’s self-explanatory, so I’m not entirely sure why this is needed, but just reading the comments under a LeedsFess post makes it very clear that it needs to be spelt out for some. White privilege is where a white person has privilege SIMPLY because of the colour of their skin. No other reason.
The main reason I can see people denying that white privilege exists is that working-class white people might face more hardships than an economically better off POC, and therefore they do not have white privilege. In CLASS TERMS, they have less privilege than someone who is better off than them. In RACIAL TERMS, they do not have less privilege than a POC. I really don’t think I need to say this, but I will for those who still aren’t getting it. The reason white people have more privilege than POC is because of racism. Don’t think that comes as a shock to anyone does it? Can you see that white people (without taking things like class, gender, sexuality, etc. into consideration) have more privileges in society than POC because they are white? Yes? Well then, you understand white privilege exists and you acknowledge its existence. Fab. If you want to understand what those privileges are, then google them.
I am not denying that race and class (and other factors) don’t intersect, because they obviously do, and people who say white privilege exists are not denying that. We are not saying white people haven’t experienced hardships in their lives. What we are arguing is that, simply due to the colour of their skin, a white person, regardless of their economic background, automatically has more privilege than a POC. This is due to racism (which both discriminates against POC AND benefits white people).
I am middle-class and mixed-race. I will never understand what it feels like to come from a working-class background. I acknowledge that, and I understand that middle-class people have far more privileges in this society than working-class people. I have an amazing friend who is working-class and white. She will never understand what it feels like to come from a minority ethnic background. She acknowledges that, and she understands that white people have far more privileges in this society than POC. Easy as that.","#22382

I just found out that whilst I was still with my ex he posted some nude videos of me online without my consent and I don’t know what to do. They’ve literally been seen by over 1,000 people and I’ve just spent the past three hours crying because all my future employers will be able to see them and you can see my face in some of them. Really need people’s help with what to do. I don’t want to go to the police because if it gets taken to court won’t they show the videos as evidence but I don’t see how else I can get the videos taken down.

Since lots of you lovely people have been heading back to Hyde Park recently I thought I'd provide the information I've gathered on the best local providers of the most important part of the food pyramid. The delicious garlic margherita. Here we go.
Pizza la Fonte - good for when you wanna do that thing where you pull the cheese out with your teeth like you’re in an advert. Lovely cheese. But oddly, a bit sweet. Average crust.
64 Pizzeria - good but very salty, the base is a bit too floury. Option to add stuffed crust for £2 but it isn’t really worth it.
Venezia Pizza - they put some good herb shit on there that makes it tasty as fuck, but not my first choice.
Pizza Pazza - bad don’t bother. Same with Ozmoz. Ubereats will try to convince you but don’t do it.
Pitza Cano - the king. Unparalleled. I could write epic poems of the weathers I’ve battled through to retrieve one of these bad boys. Unfortunately the holy land Pitza Cano has been closed during lockdown which makes me want to die but hopefully it will soon return.
Yes, I am aware this is not an extensive list but there’s only so many garlic margheritas I can order a week before I look weird thanks","#22376

After seeing the raw passion that went into that Avatar: The Last Airbender post about waterbending, I thought I would make one about a topic that I'm passionate about relating to the show.
The topic in question seems to be more controversial, at least from what I've read online (yes I know that's sad but I have a lot of free time and I keep getting recommended ATLA videos on YT recently).
Therefore, I'm going to be putting the case forward that Zutara and not Kataang should have been the final couple at the end of the series.
First of all, I'm going to address why Kataang wouldn't work.
One of the main arguments of why they were put together was because they had 'history' and went on a journey together and a fucking fortune teller. Just because you know someone for a long time and have gone through a lot with them, and get a vague fortune telling doesn't mean that you fall in love with them.
Secondly, everyone seems to be upset that Aang would be heartbreakon if Katara didn't choose him, but love is a two-way street and a relationship wouldn't last if Katara literally just picked Aang out of pity and their romance wasn't mutual. Even if you disagree with my argument, you have to agree their kisses were fucking cringe and forced.
Thirdly, Katara mothers Aang so much. I know this is simply just in her nature and is one of her strongest character traits, but she really does have more of an older sibling relationship with Aang and this would result in a platonic relationship. Aang is also 12 and Katara 14 at the end of the show (while Zuko is 16). I don't think this point holds much weight as it is a kids TV show and the age difference is the same, but I'll mention it anyway. Aang was an immature kid with God powers, while Zuko was a reckless and aimless yet determined 16 y/o and Katara a mature 14 y/o. I just think these traits reinforce the argument of Aang ultimately being more like a younger sibling and predominantly the Avatar who Katara loves but not in a romantic way. While Zutara works and they balance each other out well.
Yes, I acknowledge that Zuko tried to kill her about a dozen times and the betrayal in S2 was near unforgivable, and that his nation was basically genociding the world. BUT, Zuko pretty much has the best character arc in media ever (better than Walter White, Jamie Lannister - excluding S8, Harvey Dent in TDK etc.) He shares with Katara the history of a completely broken or disfunctional family. Katara lost her's besides Sokka due to the war, while Zuko's Mum was exiled (although he thought she was dead) and then he was physically and psychologically abused by his own father and sister. The extent of this abuse is shown by how he was manipulated to the extent that he spent years trying to impress them and come home even though he had finally escaped their abuse while exiled to capture the Avatar. Zuko made bad decisions, he did terrible things to Katara and betrayed her trust, but he finally realised what he wanted and that he had been lieing to himself and did the right thing in the end when it wasn't too late. Iroh forgave Zuko and could see the light in him throughout the whole show and never gave up. I believe someone with Katara's maturity would also be able to realise this over time and by Zuko's actions and right decisions in the final season.
These complexities that Zutara share just makes them seem more of a compatible couple. They actually challenge and help each other and had to overcome immense obstacles to forgive oneanother. Zuko helped Katara track down the soldier who killed her mother so she could finally come to peace with her loss, while Zuko took Azula's lightning strike during the final Agni Kai which probably would have been fatal if it hit Katara - she then returns to heal him while shedding a tear and them thanking eachother.
I feel like this is getting a bit too long so I will just summarise my opionion. Kutaang is incompatable due to a platonic, sibling relationship, she was put with him just for fan pandering and the children (us) watching, plus the argument that she has known Aang longer and some dumb, vague fortune telling is such bs. On the other hand, Zutara felt way more natural, more chemistry, their ages and traits made more sense to go together. Katara's maturaty and Zuko's instability but determination makes them a great couple. Finally, their relationship was built up and not forced, they put mutual and balanced effort into the relationship by doing thing's for each other and realised over time that could forgive each other and they had more in common than they first realised (bad upbringings and defeating the Fire Nation). Remember, Katara was the last of team Avatar to accept and trust Zuko, yet ended up being closest to him during Sozin's Comet.
If you think Zutaang worked better then you're stuck in 2008 kid. The hero got the girl because he was the hero not because it worked.
(Btw, check out the official ATLA youtube channel if you're bored in lockdown but cba to watch the whole thing. They seem to be uploading HD clips very recently during quarantine. If you made it this far thank you for reading and feel free to disagree you child.)","#22373

Hi, I thought it was perfect timing to write a few things. Responding to the post on racism and white privilege.
When I first started uni I walked into a room which was filled with majority white students. Literally walking into that room made my heart drop and I felt sick. As someone who comes from a very diverse area seeing the lack of diversity in the classroom left me speechless. People don’t understand the effect that racism and lack of diversity has on BAME students. Out of 65 students 6 students are from the BAME community. Institutional racism exists and when I look around the lecture hall it becomes apparent to me that uni are doing little to step away from that narrative and accept more BAME students into courses, ESPECIALLY healthcare courses.
I spoke to the head of my course about how the lack of diversity is shocking and as a Russell Group uni they should be taking steps to tackle these issues rather than ignoring them. My first year led to me having serious self confidence and image issues because I found it hard to fit in and relate to white middle class students as a working class asian student. I hope that me speaking out about the issues helped the head of my course acknowledge the lack of diversity and work towards changing it so no student feels the same way.
I also found it frustrating when I expressed my concerns and my feelings were trivialised. I think it definitely woke me up and made me more aware of the racism and lack of diversity in society. I don’t think I can comprehend the struggles and hurt that the black community is facing right now. I stand with them and I’m making sure I spread awareness and educate those around me about the brutality and oppression the black community faces daily. I do think it’s important as students to educate ourselves and learn more about these issues. For anyone who’s wanting to educate themselves more on the racial struggle and learn more about how racism exists in a western society Yale have open lectures on the African American history and it gives an in-depth understanding of how the foundation of western society is build on oppression and slavery but also the racial struggles POC have to experience in modern day society. And the struggle the black community faces daily under a government which is silencing them.
It’s important to educate your peers, your family, work colleagues etc, understand your white privilege and how to utilise it to create change. Use the privilege you have to do some good, spread awareness and NOT REMAIN SILENT. Just because this issue makes you uncomfortable doesn’t mean you can ignore it and remain silent. That’s just contributing towards the issue and dismissing the struggle that people are facing daily.
Racism exists, so don’t ignore it because it doesn’t fit your agenda. Acknowledge it and speak out because it does make a difference.","#22372

In this leedsfess I will defend my opinion that water bending was clearly the strongest and most versatile form of bending presented in avatar the last airbender, and basically the only major limitation of it, was the shows child friendly age rating, and waterbenders lack of creativity.
Disclaimer: I will not be citing sources, I am kinda drunk, I am writing this at 3:48am, I have seen avatar recently but I have not seen Korra for years, I am a stem student who can't write essays, and my tutor has said that my writing is hard to follow and is in great need of work. Ps fuck anyone who disagrees with me.
Water bending is on par with the other forms of bending in the small scale, martial art fights mostly shown by the show. We routinely see Katara / Aang / Kora hold their own against multiple different fire, air and earth benders throughout the show using waterbending. Waterbending is also used in Korra to make a sword, and whilst weapons arnt used much in bending combat in the ATLA world, it still seems pretty helpful. Whilst in the show waterbending certainly seems slightly weaker, or atleast less flashy than firebending and airbending in many fights, when push comes to shove it can end a fight extremely quickly, for example Katara instantly and completely encasing azula in ice in the final episode, or when she encases zuko in an ice sphere at the spirit oasis.
Hand to hand combat: 3/5
We also see waterbending used on huge scales to creat tsunamis, or move thousands of tonnes of water and ice. Whilst similar large scale bending is shown for earth bending too, firebending could only reach similar feats during sozhins comet. Water bending could also be used to fucking cut clean through metal, albeit relatively slowly, and could cut through solid rocks like they were paper. This means that waterbending would nearly definitely be the most deadly in combat if it wasn't a kids show (apart from maybe the lightning part of firebending, and zaheers highly skilled use of airbending)
Raw power: 5/5
Waterbending also provided pretty good movement, waterbenders could obviously move very quickly on, in or above large bodies of water, but on land water bending allowed for frozone-esque ice sliding & the water spout flying. This movement is obviously inferior to the movement provided by airbending, but is probably on par with the sliding, wall running, and land surfing provided by earthbending. Firebending seems to provide very limited increases to mobility (azula sliding up the chain in the prison episode, and the occasionally fire boosted jump are the only examples I can think of, except during sozhins comet where firebenders could firebend to fly).
Even though it's good, I still have to give it a low score as inferior to normal airbending, and leagues behind the airbending done by Zaheer in Korra, or the avatar in the avatar state.
Mobility 2/5
Waterbending is also incredibly versatile, whilst firebending can use some lightning (and maybe explosions, we don't know how that dude shoots explosions from his head afaik) and earth bending can use crystals, sand, magma and metal. Waterbending allows for control of so many mediums.
For example the control of plants is immensely strong, Huu bending plants in the swamps to form a swamp monster holds his own against both team avatar very well, and the firebender tanks on the eclipse day, however this is not really expanded upon in the show at all so we don't know the extent of it.
In a similar vein, Kataras bending of slurry during the drill fight, aswell as bending of ink and other liquids, shows that waterbending extends to so many other mediums that weren't really explored by the show. This incidates that there are many more tools available to waterbenders, both to get water for normal use, or for controlling other mediums, and that the main limitation to pure water was either a natrative choice by the writers, or the lack creativity and surrificent skill of the waterbender. Also the manipulation of water vapour and clouds, are used for cover frequently in the show, and further build on the idea that waterbending works on water in many forms.
General versatility 5/5
The bending of ice is also on par with earth bending in many situations, allowing katara to form walls, armour, tools, and weapons, but with much more control than most earth bending we see.
For example nearly all earth ending seems to involve throwing rocks or shards of rock, but afaik these are rarley, if ever controlled with great precision mid air, (the hands the dai li use are rerouted but there's no fine control from a distance), kataras control of the needles of ice she throws is so much greater, in one instance forming rain into ice, launching them at her target, and stopping them in mid air inches infront of his face, all within a few second.
However it is worth noting that many of the feats achieved with earth bending are not repeated using ice, despite the opportunity presenting itself to strong benders like Katara, aang, Korra, pakku, amon, kya, varrik, and Ming hua, we can only assume that ice bending is just more limited in many ways. Control, & earth bending with ice 3/5
Waterbending also gave the ability to heal (for some people), which is obviously super strong in so many ways that I'm not even gonna defend it, (also using bending to soothe spirits is also another huge advantage but idk what to say about soothing spirits, and the spirit stuff is mainly in Korra S2 which is garbage imo).
Healing and soothing 5/5 (not that any others even qualify)
In terms of power ups, The full moon water bending powerup is alot more common than a comment that only comes around every ~100 years for boosting firebending, however the effects do seem less pronounced. The poweroff during the lunar eclipse seems comparable to firebending during a solar eclipse, or if anything slightly better as it happens at night, not curing the day. (afaik they never disclaimed an earth or air bending powerup astrology event).
Space stuff 3/5
Finally fucking blood bending! You literally can control people like puppets and it can also be used to take away their bending! Initially this is said to only be possible on a full moon, but Katara does this to the captain of the southern raiders too, and I'm not sure if that was a full moon, and then in Korra multiple baddies do it during the day. Also if it wasn't a kids show, blood bending could probably explode them or some shit. In Korra Zaheer airbends the air out of someone's lungs, so if that's possible I can't see why bloobending can't be used for instant murder. Or maybe just water could be pulled from corpses or animals in the same way it's pulled from plants. Either way it's OP as fuck. Also blood bending is used to beat BOTH of our avatar main characters, the avatars would obviously be your main threat if you were gonna use your waterbending / blood bending to be an awesome murder villan, and the fact that they're not resistant or some bullshit is very helpful.
Mind control 1000/5
Taking away people's bending 5/5
Murder 5/5
So basically, the supposed drawback of waterbending was that it isn't as readily available / produced as the other types of bending. Fire could just be produced at will (as long as you had enough emotion inside of you), air bending works everywhere universally, and earthbending was only really limited by large wooden/ metal buildings, or by being in the sky.
But by the third season we see benders pulling water:
• out if their sweat,
• out of clouds thousands of feet in the sky,
• out of grass & flowers,
• out of mixed drinks, perfume, stew & ink
• out of moisture in the air,
• out of damp fabrics,
• out of blood
• from the water table under the earth,
• and out of solid tree trunks
• aswell as obviously from all sources of water and ice.
Basically the only limitations / weaknesses to being a badass waterbender are:
• if theres no water around, your only choice in combat is to just kill them with blood bending really,
• that you cant fly as freely as the other types of bending as you need a large body of water near by to hold your weight.
• that lightning bending, or metal bending could possibly beat you? But theyre both high skill bending types akin to bloodbending so that kind of seems fair.

Advice pls. Should I message my friend who has a girlfriend (just to check-in)?
One of my friends has been quiet on the group chat. It's a big group chat with lots of people in, so it's not that odd that he's been so silent. Still, given the circumstances I kind of want to check-in to see how he is and make sure he's alright.
My dilemma is that he has a girlfriend, also in the group. I actually knew her first, and only really came to know him as a result of knowing her. I never normally message him, but I would normally see him around uni, and obviously, I can't do that now.
I'm pretty sure his girlfriend wouldn't care but I'm worried it will make him uncomfortable if I message him. I'm not interested in sliding into him DMs, but I'm concerned he'll worry that's what I'm doing. I just want him to know that his friends care about him.
I'm 100% overthinking this but would appreciate others' input, especially if you're in a relationship.

Thank you so much to the older couple I met today. I'm living at home with my family, and my home situation isn't always great, and things got heated, not even with me involved but it was just too much for me and I had to leave. I was walking down the hill away from my house sobbing, and that just made me so embarrassed, and everyone was staring at me and I just felt so fucking alone. Then I was sitting in park unable to stop crying, and an older couple came up to, and the woman broke her social distancing, and put herself at risk to give me a hug. She didn't judge a 6'2 male stranger for crying alone in a busy park in the centr of a city, and it was one of the kindest things anyone has done for me. I feel bad for putting her at risk but there are some fucking incredible people out there.","#22343

So..I’ve been going out with someone for 1.5 years, I care about them so much but they are very manipulative and jealous. I’ve tried to break up with them over lockdown when I was at home and told my friends and parents about things they’ve said to me. I know I should keep some relationship matters private but I was so upset about everything I just let it spill. Everyone (including our mutual friend) says it’s a long time coming and that the person doesn’t treat me right. I officially ended it the other night, but the next day they came round to get their stuff and I just couldn’t. My vagina took over and we had sex... worst mistake of my life, I couldn’t go through with the break up after that. When I’m sober I think of them fondly but as soon as I’ve had a drink I hate them and don’t even want to think about them. I just keep wondering if they mean that they’re going to change, even after I’ve brought the manipulative and controlling issue up multiple times? Are things really going to change? I’ve been working for almost a year and hardly know anyone there because I feel like I can’t go out and fully let go without them having an issue with it or making me feel bad for going out! I’m just finding it hard to come to terms with it and I don’t want to take them back, I just feel like I’m not me when I’m with them but I love them so much that I don’t want to hurt?!
Long but yeah, any thoughts/opinions?
Also they’ve already bought me birthday presents, how do you deal with that?","#22342

Okay so there are many people skateboarding or roller blading on the streets of their places where there are very few cars, that’s how they use their workout-time during the quarantine (skateparks are closed); the police is absolutely okay with that, i assure you. me and my boyfriend are one of those people, picked up the activity to learn something new and move more, always being polite, getting out of the way when the cars come, sometimes waving to the people who pass by, laughing with them when we fall. 99% of the time the experience is amazing, but then there’s 1% of it, when someone shouts at you for not moving out of the way ‘enough’, and says they’re gonna drive through you, that they’ve seen you skate/roll every day and that you’re shit at it (while holding some fast food in their hands and boasting about having a car more expensive than your skateboard (you don’t say mate)). then they call you a ‘fucking idiot’ (being much bigger dudes than me-a petite girl). the whole day is ruined, don’t wanna go outside again to that only patch of smooth concrete anywhere around our place. everything those people said tells me much more about them, not us, for a conversation is impossible, just the repetitive ‘fucking idiot’ thing. you’d think these times would mean mutual understanding of people’s wellbeing, but it doesn’t seem so even regarding such a simple situation as this one. it will take some time to get self-confidence back and find a new place to skate. pls be nice. and don’t create unecessary conflicts - asking to move aside more nicely is enough and everyone skating/rolling will respond to that much more effectively.","#22334

A moment to appreciate how peak it’s going to be for freshers this year. When lectures get moved online for the first semester which is inevitably going to happen, the only chance they’re going to get to meet people is in halls, which if you don’t get lucky is one of the worst places for this. And even if they are lucky enough to find a few people they like, they won’t be able to consolidate the friendship by doing stupid things on a night out. They’ll just be stuck in their rooms with minimal work and nothing to do. RIP 2020/2021 freshers","#22319

Absolutely shitting myself at the prospect of all lectures being online for semester one.
My parents are very strict and being at Uni this year, despite some mental health issues, was the first time I finally had the chance to be myself 24/7. The first time in my life that I wasn’t constantly belittled, gaslighted and made to feel like a literal pile of shit everyday.
Isolation with them has been a nightmare. It’s like walking on eggshells living here. Sometimes I starve myself so I don’t have to face going downstairs to see them incase I say something wrong and start another argument. I’m made to feel guilty for existing.
The thing is, if lectures are online, my parents will forbid me from coming back to Leeds for the semester in order to save money. You might be like, “oh but you can just leave because you’re an adult.” Well jokes because my parents like to remind me that I don’t deserve to be treated like one and haven’t earned the right yet. Also, it’s quite complicated considering I have younger siblings I want to look out for.
It’s either I live by my parents’ terms until I graduate to be able to be there for my siblings, or I leave and can’t be there for them when they need me.
I wish things were different and we had a little more clarity about what’s happening. I just want my safe space back tbh.
To those who might suspect your friend is struggling in any way, please check up on them. A little message from you might mean the world to them. Honestly, whenever I get a message from my friends it’s like a little light is turned on in the midst of all the darkness.
And to anyone else out there who’s struggling with family issues in isolation, just know you’re not alone. We can get through this and we’re strong as fuck. ❤️❤️","#22306

2) panic the day before the exam starts as you realise how much you're gonna have to do and start frantically trying to ingest any information at all
3) get up at 7am the day of, down at least 3 mugs of black coffee and get ready
4) google what the essay title means and frantically half read 20 study abstracts in between lengthy procrastination sessions
5) half write a hazy 1500 abomination of the english language and go to bed. its the end of day 1
6) lie in bed thinking restlessly about how much you have fucked up the entire module grade
7) have a long lie in, after all you've already written most of the essay and it just needs tidying up now.
8) re-read your essay and realise its completely irrelevant to the essay title and repeat steps 4 and 5.
9) dont even bother re-reading the essay this time youll just get more and more anxious
10) submit your barely a 3rd essay

I'd just like to warn people that I'm mentioning someone who passed away in this confession.
My granny passed away a couple of day, we'd been expecting it for a while because she had been dealing with dementia for the last decade or so. My last two years at university have both concluded in the death of relatives as last year my grandpa and uncle also passed. The situation is different this time as I'm unable to leave my country to go to the funeral in may. And I feel numb, empty and lost.
And its ok. It's ok not to feel alright in time like these, it's sad and it's heartbreaking for me to say goodbye to another family member, but I know it's okay for me to have a few mental health days, and not deal with the shit life throws my way for as long as I need. The moment will come when I'll need to get back up and move on but that moment isn't now. For now I'm, and you're, allowed to stay in bed, and process what just happened.
I guess what I'm trying to say is give yourself a break. You're not feeling good because of everything happening and you don't have to put a smile on your face and pretend. For anyone who's lost a member of their family in this crisis whether it's covid related or not. I'm with you. You aren't alone and above all you're valid. I just wanna make that abundantly clear ❤️❤️❤️","#22104

Dear everyone,
I am sat writing this through tears on my way home for the foreseeable future. The past three years I have spent in Leeds has safely been the best three years of my life. I don’t think I have gone a day without laughing uncontrollably at least once. That is thanks to my amazing friends, and all the other fantastic people that make of the University of Leeds. Times are tough, but it has really made me appreciate those that I love even more! So from the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone for the memories, and for the future memorable moments that we will inevitably share! 🥺🤗 Tell your friends you love them, tell them how happy they’ve made you! Life is too short not too! Good luck everybody, you’re all amazing! And once again to my friends, thanks for everything! 🤯😚

Oh Lord above help me.
I'm on placement, always said ""Don't shit where you eat"" and laughed at all the grads who did.
Shoulda fucking listened to myself should I?! Cos karma is a bitch and I've full on explosive diarrheaed where I eat.
Got with a cute grad from work last week and one thing led to another...
Mid master bj, he shakes, like full on body shakes, which makes me laugh doesn't it, cos I mean I know I'm good but I didn't know I was that good. Mistake. He cums at that moment and I full on choke on little swimmers.
You ever laughed while having a drink and it's come (pun intended) out your nose? Well it happened didn't it. Ejaculated from his penis, to my mouth, from my nose back on to his penis.
We both look stunned at the mucussy gentleman's relish on his dick and slowly raise our eyes till they meet. I have never seen such a horror in someone's eyes.
Found out today we are now on the same project until the end of my placement.","#21981

I didn’t think this needed saying but since a friend was assaulted I’m just gonna say it.
Consent is fucking important. It should be verbal, clear and consistent. No one is gonna be annoyed you asked if they’re okay. It doesn’t matter if you’ve already been making out, doing bits or you’ve had sex in the past does not mean you can assume they consent. Check in regularly, even if you’re already having sex people can change their minds, that’s fine, and you should not make people feel bad about it.
And finally, BELIEVE VICTIMS, if someone tells you they’ve been assaulted they probably have been, be supportive, be caring, and don’t doubt them.","#21978

To #21965 and anyone else who has stopped going into uni...
First of all, the reason you stopped going into uni and can't get back into it is probably a bit to do with anxiety, so take some time to look after yourself. Have a day where you have orange juice and lots of vitamins, do any washing up and cleaning, wash your bedding, shower, and put nice fresh clothes on. Get some ABBA on while you do it to keep you pumped.
Pack a bag the night before with everything you need, and write a list of what you'll do in the morning step by step, e.g. eat pancakes, brush teeth, get dressed, set off
In the morning, get up as soon as your alarm goes off and follow your list.
If you're still struggling, reach out to your tutor, lecturer, or friends and ask them to help encourage you.
Good luck and don't give up. We're all just slowly dying so don't waste your precious time slobbing about the house","#21972

As you stand around still talking to your friends you feel a bit of dampness in your underwear and become a bit flustered, asking yourself, was that just a wet fart or was there more to it? Luckily, your bedroom is closest to the kitchen so you waddle out, the cold bedroom air hitting your face, and the smell of air freshener hanging around, almost taunting you as if it knows what awaits for you. You go into the bathroom, close your door firmly, and gradually pull your trousers down, being as cautious as possible. Once you’re sat on the toilet the horror is revealed. You’ve stone-cold sober sharted into your pants, the amount of wetness cannot be fathomed and a big streak of faeces stares you right in the eyes. My life has gone downhill since this moment. I am ashamed. But nothing will ever make me happier than seeing the looks on my flat mates faces when I showed them my newly decorated underwear x","#21937

You go into the bathroom, close your door firmly, and gradually pull your trousers down, being as cautious as possible. Once you’re sat on the toilet the horror is revealed. You’ve stone-cold sober sharted into your pants, the amount of wetness cannot be fathomed and a big streak of faeces stares you right in the eyes. My life has gone downhill since this moment. I am ashamed. But nothing will ever make me happier than seeing the looks on my flat mates faces when I showed them my newly decorated underwear x",,1583693768,,,43,15,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=551693878784149&id=279761922644014,

The other one is decent got benches n that along with yet again metal fencing around reminding me of my time in a young offenders institution. Overall - 6/10
4. Fruity - I mean the main smokers at fruity has a class vibe and bare space but the bouncers get so pi*sy about drinks. I always find myself talking to randoms for the whole night in there, rather than enjoying the beautiful sound of Pitbull/Taio Cruz in the main room. 7/10

I would never leave if I could but I always get complaints from my mates that I only wanna sit there to smoke, especially whilst this lovely storm is about.

Hi, this has been really difficult for me to write. It opens up a lot of confused feelings that I haven’t been able to confront until now. Please read this passage and if you can, help me end my suffering.
The time I met Poo Boy:
It’s the middle of the night, I’m on the dance floor but I need the toilet. No-one wants to come with me but it’s fine, it can’t be that scary?
I reach the toilet. The atmosphere is solemn. A crowd surrounds the facilities. Each individual glances around the room scathingly, tuts and mutters echo in between furious scribbles on clipboards. All of a sudden, the room falls silent. Every member of this toilet cult stares in anticipation at the slowly opening cubicle door. There, standing in the doorway, expression furrowed with concentration, their messiah - poo boy.
Every action poo boy makes is deliberate, synchronised with the whirls and crashes of the flushing loo behind him. He contemplates the crowd, judging each member with a scouring gaze. At last he pulls up his clipboard and clears his throat.
“Space - 5/10”
The clan gasp. Their eyes dart erratically from clipboard to poo boy. Silence. Then the slow clap begins. One member, then two, then all. Woops, cheers, calls and whistles. The room erupts into a roar of adulation. But poo boy merely nods his head. He does not do this for the praise, the plaudits, the glory. He does it because if he doesn’t, no-one will.
It’s at this moment that I am spotted. Poo boy’s eyes fall on me. I will never forget those eyes. Serious. Strong. Dependable.
I shuddered. And then I ran.
There was nothing else I could do. With tears streaming down my face I ran. Out of the club and into the street I ran. Into feelings and a longing that I could never imagine, I ran.
My friends don’t understand. No-one does. This is my final attempt to find those dependable eyes once again.
Poo Boy, who are you?","#20683

What the Christmas break says about the future of your situationship/friend with benefits (from a very tired fourth year who’s seen it all):
Visited each other at least once: made the effort to actually trek to the other person’s home town, good sign. Bonus points for meeting the parents. DOUBLE bonus points if the journey was over 2 hours. The “what are we?” conversation could be on the horizon
“I miss you” texts: interesting one. Maybe they do actually miss you but maybe they just miss having someone to shag.
Barely spoke to each other: this one speaks for itself. If they liked you, they’d be texting you. A relationship is looking unlikely mate
Gave each other Christmas presents: this is cute and something that tends to only happen in relationships. implies there might be some deeper feelings there, likely to get wifed up soon
They fucked their ex: we all have the temptation when we’re back home and know a familiar shag is only a 2am text away. Don’t deep this one too much, especially if you shagged yours too. What happens at home stays at home. Relationship is still possible
Talked everyday: another interesting one. You could really like each other BUT they could just be staying in contact to ensure they’ll still have a guaranteed fuck buddy when they get back to uni
In conclusion, if you want it to get serious then you have to ask. Say fuck it and just send that text. Best case scenario is you end up together. Worst case scenario is they tell you to do one and it’s back to Tinder you go.","#20642

In respone to #LeedsFess17616 this isn't irrational!
I would suggest giving one or two of your friends the address of where you're going, the persons name and maybe number or social media handle(s), and letting them know that you'll check in by a certain time, that way if they haven't heard from you by that time they can call you and take it from there. Or maybe put your location on too.
If you're really concered about this maybe just try meeting them in public a few times first, or just talking to them about your concerns (most people feel the say)
Hope this helps x","#LeedsFess17780

My family poops big. Maybe it's genetic, maybe it's our diet, but everyone births giant logs of crap. If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.
Growing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out ""hey, can you get me the poop knife""?
I thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife.
Fast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.
""My what?""
Your poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please.
""Wtf is a poop knife?""
Obviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.
He starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.
I told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes.
She will be getting her own utility knife now.
Why was this not in the bathroom instead of the laundry room? We only had one poop knife, and the laundry room was central to all three bathrooms. I have no idea why we didn't have three poop knives. All I know is that we didn't. We had the one. Possibly because my father was notoriously cheap about the weirdest things. So yes, we shared our poop knife.","#LeedsFess9625

Can’t believe I’ve seen posts on here saying that individual action against climate change won’t do anything because the top 100 polluting companies who produce 71% of emissions are really to blame. Companies and governments WON’T change if the consumer / political will isn’t there, so activist movements and increasing consumer awareness are important and will affect positive change! Saying that individual action doesn’t change anything is like saying you shouldn’t vote because you’re just one person. Also, these companies are ran on our money; vote with your money and stop supporting them if you can, instead of just shrugging and saying there’s nothing you can do as an individual. They don’t want to lose profit.
Plus, governments and corporations move slowly but there are things you can do to change today; for example, the UK throws away 7 million coffee cups daily even though it would easy and cheap for everyone to switch to reusable cups. We could stop 2.5 BILLION coffee cups being thrown away every year if each individual made the choice to switch to reusables. But, sure, pollution is just the fault of the oil companies.

RE: #LeedsFess8507
You only enjoy this situation because you are insecure, and you get off on the idea that more than one person could like you simultaneously. It's not right to your girlfriend to be a cheat, it is never right to cheat. As for the other girl, she literally mugged you off for another geezer... why would you want to revisit that when she clearly doesn't respect you. If you want to be a player then be a man, respectfully break up with your girl and stand on your own to feet. Stop being so pathetically wet about it though.","#LeedsFess8775

Re: Leedsfess8377. Sexual assault is something that is extremely traumatic and can have lasting emotional scars. For significant others, this can be very difficult to deal with, as they now have an association of touching with that night. Give her time, be patient. She needs to look after herself and get to a point where she can separate what happened to her from other future sexual encounters. More than ever is she going to need support from those closest to her, to remind her that she is not alone, that she is safe. I know you have to look after yourself and make sure you're getting what you need in the relationship, but she will be so grateful to you for waiting until she is ready, respecting and helping her to be confident in herself again. I really hope that you both are okay, and can work through this together. x","#LeedsFess8568
