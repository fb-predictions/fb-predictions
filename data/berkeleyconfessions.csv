2731794010430353,"6779.5. Response to #6764: This is quite frankly the most idiotic argument I've ever read.
Your first argument is that fraternities only improve professional skills for their members. What about everyone else? Well, you're free to join a club that teaches similar content or even learn those skills on your own. Who's stopping you? I can guarantee any useful content that you learn during pledging can be found in a business course or online (FREE).
The second argument is that Greek organizations are ""fronts for exclusion and nepotism based on arbitrary social cues rather than actual merit."" So, in other words, you're mad they have a network? Like cmon, I think even you realize that everything in life is not based on merit. If so let's get rid of HKN and UPE along with every honor society on campus. Every individual at Cal fights to get their job. No recruiter will come to you because you are the most qualified. Even colleges use personal statements. I have tough news for you buttercup. Your personality and social ability will play a part in how successful you are.
Finally, you say ""some"" Greek communities are good. But then go onto say ""all"" Greek communities are terrible and resistant to any positive change or social movements. Well, I regret to tell you apart from contradicting yourself, you also contradict basic logic. Lots of fraternities on campus have taken steps towards reducing rape at parties. They hold workshops for their members and do their best to keep each other accountable. Just because rapes are more common at parties (because ppl are intoxicated) you can't blame frats for it. I know a lot of brothers who would take a rape accusation very seriously and make sure whoever committed the crime is thrown out (Nicholas Zhao for example was banned from a lot of frats).
And finally, the corona incident. First, not all fraternities were complicit. And yeah it's regrettable, but people chose to attend those parties. Those same people would have most likely partied regardless of the existence of fraternities. So you're just mad that people are not taking COVID seriously, but somehow that's the fault of Greek life? The semester would never have been mostly in-person anyway.
Overall, the argument has really terrible logic. People join fraternities so they get a close group of friends WHILE learning key professional principles. Frats help people grow and hold parties for fun too.
The only argument against fraternities that I do concede and want to improve is the lack of diversity. Frats at Cal aren't explicitly racist, but they have started to notice the lack of diversity present in recruiting cycles and in the groups they reach out to. So if you have any constructive feedback for fraternities please do tell, but stop hating on society just because you feel excluded from professional/social activities or don't have a network.","6779.5.

I'm Indian and I grew up in a mostly white area, so I'm used to being ridiculed or at least given weird looks for embracing anything close to my culture (my religion Hinduism, or my traditional clothes, or Bollywood). I was never too much into yoga but it's so fucking annoying to see yoga everywhere, and white companies profiting off of selling yoga pants (and how they're just SO sexy and turn guys on). Like jeez have a little respect. It hasn't even been 100 years since the British stopped fucking colonizing us and you're already profiting off of us at the expense of diluting our culture and rebranding it so it's tasteful for white people? And don't even get me started on celebrities wearing bindis and shit, like I genuinely don't understand why white people find it so hard not to take things from other cultures lmao?? Like I have a lot of friends from different backgrounds (Hispanic, Chinese, Japanese, etc.) and I've NEVER felt the urge to want to wear a kimono for Halloween or eat a taco every week while hating Mexicans. IF ITS NOT YOURS DONT TRY TO TAKE IT, ITS THAT SIMPLE! And if you don't think cultural appropriation is real, just try talking to ANY of your POC friends about it and I guarantee you every one of us is sick of being your Halloween costume and your Coachella outfit and the companies you make that use Hinduism, MY religion, as a fucking trend to try to get people to ""reach enlightenment."" Fuck your enlightenment, and your soul searching. There's nothing wrong with converting to Hinduism or Buddhism or whatever, but if you're going to profit off of ancient religions that didn't belong to your ancestors, think about why you think that's OK?? Colonialism may be ""over,"" but the effects of it sure aren't. It's visible in Japan where the US decided to decimate 2 atomic bombs, it's present in Vietnam where so many babies are born with birth defects from Agent Orange, it's present in how the current day police target Black people, it's present in how Mexicans are called ""illegal"" in their native land, it's fucking responsible for the rise of Islamic terrorism which White Americans love to twist to their benefit by demonizing an entire religion instead of realizing they're the real fucking terrorists.

Sometimes, they discreetly cross the street, or inconspicuously look over their shoulders, while speeding up. Experiencing these reactions throughout my life made me hyper-aware of body language and how strangers react differently when facing white or Asian peers. I understand how unsafe Berkeley surroundings can be especially for women, and I try to look friendly when passing by a stranger, but I forgot how many times I had to slow down my pace after I perceived some signs of distress, or how many times I had to walk past as far away as it was possible, to make the other person comfortable. Throughout my life, I've tried to be the best version of myself to compensate for the pervasive stereotypes of my people, but it gets exhausting, it gets exhausting.

To be honest, it was very bitter and tasted like soap. So the following day I decided to drink 8 oz of pineapple juice and then cummed a few hours later, but my cum still tasted the same.
I figured it was because my body didn't have enough time to metabolize it so, my scientific curiosity getting the best of me, decided to spend all week drinking and eating pineapple and then check again at the end of the week.

tldr don't mess around and get bad grades ur freshman year
When I was a freshman I thought it was ok to get bad grades, because upperclassmen were always talking about how they got Tesla or Adobe jobs with a gpa in the low 3's or even 2-something. So I kinda slacked off a little, especially in my non-EE/CS classes and got a goodly amount of B's.
Well, scamper forward one year ? two years ? (or maybe more, who still keeps track of time nowadays?) I have spent the majority of my short life receiving rejection after rejection from EECS research labs because they only recruit people with a GPA of 3.8 or higher.
I guess my freshman ass couldn't have known that I might have wanted to do research and go to grad school someday, but honestly I should have considered that possibility before skipping those R1A assignments :((
Also @ those people who are always braggin about getting a cool job or research op with a low gpa, pls keep in mind that u may be misleading dumb impressionable freshmen. but I guess it's kinda my own fault for believing anecdotal evidence i guess. i was pretty dumb. still dumb now, but my current dumb is more of like a my-own-fault kinda dumb; freshman me was a not-my-own-fault kinda dumb.","6771.

Since quarantine, I've been having suicidal thoughts. It's gotten a lot worse recently, the past few weeks - casual intrusive thoughts in the middle of working, eating, living. One dinner, I was having similar thoughts - and I realized my family laughing and having a conversation. I feel so pained that I wanted to die even if I were to leave them behind. I don't know how I feel about this... I want to die, I want to stop, but I don't want to have them in pain. Or anyone.","6765. cw: suicide

2730824280527326,"6764. Given the news that the recent surge in covid-19 cases was due to irresponsible partying by our school's Greek societies, and also that fall semester will (for now) be completely online, I think it's time to seriously evaluate whether social Greek societies contribute a net positive or negative experience for ALL students. All we hear is pathetic excuses about how frats help their members learn ""business skills,"" or the value of ""brotherhood,"" or how sororities help advance the state of women in business and academia, but that's specifically for the members themselves. What about everyone else? In addition to the recent attention they're getting for shutting down the campus, it's well documented that many of our frats exemplify and ignore rape culture, racial tribalism, alcohol abuse, and economic inequality. Even outside of social fraternities and sororities, Greek societies that claim to help students build skills in business, networking, or academia in their chosen professional field just end up being fronts for exclusion and nepotism based on arbitrary social cues rather than actual merit. All they end up doing is creating these bubbles of self-aggrandizing privilege, completely ignorant to the state of the actual world, in the name of brotherhood or sisterhood. I get even more angry when I think about how people justify this system by the ""immense"" amount of community service or fundraising that Greek societies participate in. I can promise you that if you want to help your community by volunteering or donating, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of organizations in the Bay Area that welcome volunteers, donations, and help that don't also protect rapists.
This isn't meant to paint a broad brushstroke over all Greek societies, or even all social Greek societies. A lot protect and support marginalized communities, dedicate themselves to their craft or profession, and generally speaking, operate like any other club on campus. But as we think more about how abstract systems of oppression in the real world operate, we have to realize that all Greek societies on campus are ignorant, and even defensive, when it comes to improving how they operate. And while some might defend their place in our school by saying that they give members experience in business or academia, networking skills, and professional guidance, all of these are already provided by other organizations and clubs on campus. At the end of the day, the only thing that distinguishes Greek societies is the negatives. This is why we, as a complete campus (and not just a bunch of pissed Greek members trying to describe their experiences as ""formative"") need to decide whether we want Greek societies to continue to receive ASUC sponsorship and funding (which comes from ALL students' tuition), whether or not we want the administration to place sanctions on members of Greek societies (like was recently enacted in Harvard), or whether we want to abolish them outright. It is OUR decision, as the entire student body, to make, and should not be dominated by the voices of the Greek societies themselves.","6764.

So idk why but I just remembered this book I read a few years ago about a school shooting (it was fictional and it was called Nineteen Minutes, it’s a good book!!) Basically in the book the author explores the events that lead up to the main character going on a shooting spree. I don’t think the book glorifies school shooters, but it showed how the shooter guy (Peter? I think) was continuosuly bullied since kindergarten and he finally lashed out in an unfortunately violent way. And the book also depicted how everyone heaped all the blame on his parents for “not raising him right.” I also watched a TED talk by the mom of one of the Columbine school shooters, and she also talked about how everyone blamed her and her husband but she seemed like the sweetest woman. I just think it’s completely reductive to blame parents for the actions of their kids. I’m referring to parents that stuck around and raised their kids as well as they could, not parents that left or did bad things. But it also wasn’t necessarily the fault of everyone who bullied him, but they shouldn’t have done it because that’s just a shitty thing to do. But no one just randomly decides to shoot a bunch of their classmates without contemplating it for a very long time. It’s obviously the shooter’s fault but it’s also more complex than that.","6761. cw: school shootings

His jaw was huge and boney. He had a perfectly trimmed 5 oclock shadow, huge shoulders, and beefy biceps. But then, his last pic got my pussy throbbing uncontrollably. He showed himself completely naked, except for a towel, that was hanging off his dick, but his dick was HUGGEEE. I mean it was basically the size of a pringles can. I frantically swiped right, and he had already liked me back. We start messaging and he tells me he is working in a lab testing a covid19 vaccine. OMG. My pussy is literally dripping into my panties at this point.
A day later, I finally go over to his place about a mile away. When I come inside, he shows me a piece of paper. He tells me it's a covid19 test result he got the day before to make me feel safe and secure. OMG. This guy is fucking lit. He started kissing me and jammed his huge, manly hands into my pussy. After a few minutes, I feel his python start to harden and stiffen. It makes me tremble with delight. I can feel a huge, hot warm log pressing into my thigh. "" I want you, do whatever you want to me"".
At that moment, he rips out his dick, and I swear, I just orgasmed from looking at it. It had a head the size of a large apple and a shaft like a freaking pringles can. It was the sexiest organ in the entire universe. I felt almost commanded by it. He ordered me on my back and legs spread. I followed his command. When the head grazed the lips of my pussy, I couldn't stop thinking of how much cum he was going to pump into my tiny womb, or how I might get pregnant with 10 of his children.
""Baby, i'm about to cum, and I'm going to cum so hard i'm going to vaccinate you against the coronavirus"".
He came, and my god, I literally felt like someone stuck a hose up my pussy and turned the water pressure on max. I saw my abdomen bloating with his beloved, wonderful seed. I simply collapsed after that, in a bliss of his seed and manly goodness.","6758. Bored, sitting in my apartment in Berkeley, I whipped out tinder and started flipping through some guys.

2730825747193846,"6766. I swear straight guys have the shittiest gaydar ever. They always try to look for superficial signs of gayness (not every gay is a RuPaul loving femqueen with a lisp and ""Born This Way"" tattooed on their arms y'all) and not any of the actual cues. So from a fellow guy, here are seven ways to tell if another guy is gay:
1. Gay guys never compliment other guys' looks to their face, not even a new haircut or nice clothes. Often, this is due to their insecurity that other guys (especially straight guys) would take the compliments the wrong way.
2. Gay guys always take their sweet time figuring out if another guy is gay before flirting with them (or sliding in their DMs), often employing tactics like ""the gayze"" and carefully placed leading questions and comments. They would never outright flirt with or hit on a guy in fear that if the guy is straight, then they could lose their friendship, or worse, become the subject of homophobic attacks.
3. Gay guys easily become flustered when they receive even the most simple of compliments from guys they perceive as straight. They would close off and often have the slightest hesitation in their response. Either that or they become slightly defensive and agitated.
4. Gay guys don't have a filter around straight women and tend to treat them as friends instead of love interests. Contrastingly, straight guys tend to be either 1) extremely calculating around women, or 2) extremely direct and creepy (to overcompensate for their low self-esteem).
5. Gay guys tend to be a little more obsessively insecure about their image than straight guys (not saying that straight guys don't want to look good, but there is much less of an attachment between looking good and feeling confident). And no, I'm not necessarily talking about fashion, but habits. This could be anything from obsessively gymming, trying to look ""straight"" around other guys, eating disorders, etc.
6. Gay guys get very nervous about engaging in physical contact with other guys, especially hugs (honestly it's the cutest thing ever).
7. Gay guys like dick and as long as it's not your dick it's none of your damn business if they're gay or not. If they happen to like your dick, you can politely decline and remain friends with them. At the end of the day, you should be there for your gay friends, love them for who they are, and help them be a better version of themselves.","6766.

So anyways, I love the taste of cum. I grew an addiction to it during my first year at Cal. If I use a condom, I always dig it back up from the trash so I can save the cum for consumption later. I usually have at least one stored away at a time in case of emergency. Is this weird or does anyone do this too? What sucks about my addiction is that quarantine has hit me really hard because I’ve been deprived of the taste for months. I’ve started to go crazy. Every time I give head, I cherish every minute I have with the taste lingering in my mouth until it unfortunately has to go away. I another thing I do is I try to see how many different guys’ seeds I can hold in my ass at a time until I have to take a shit because the more I have in me at a time, the more confident and sexy I feel. And the thing that turns me on the most is being seen as the innocent virgin who studies all day but is secretly walking around campus, sitting in lecture, and seeing friends while carrying loads from various guys. Go Bears!","6754.

I don’t know what to do. I feel depraved and dysfunctional and insane. My dad used to physically discipline us, and I know that he thinks it was only discipline, but I think he went out of control a lot. He used to hit me and tear up my homework and barge into my room and break things and throw me around. He once grabbed my throat because I talked back to him. He would call me all sorts of names and say all sorts of horrible things to me. He’s given me all sorts of issues with authority and men in general. I was really anxious about coming home because I didn’t want to deal with him but we’ve mostly been avoiding each other, so that’s been good. Today my brother said something to me which hurt my feelings so I went to my room and locked the door and he (my brother) and my mom knocked on the door and when I didn’t open it they picked the lock (it’s a stupidly easy lock to pick you can just slide a toothpick into a hole in the doorknob and it opens) and then they came into my room and I didn’t want to talk so I kept telling them to go away and they wouldn’t. My mom sat down on my bed so close to me and I kept telling them to leave me alone and they wouldn’t and I just wanted to be left alone which is why I locked the fucking door. They didn’t leave and they kept telling me to stop overreacting and it was fine and my brother apologized but they wouldn’t fucking leave no matter how many times I told them to go away. I was losing it and I grabbed the first thing I could find (a highlighter) and just chucked it at my brother and I didn’t even mean to hit him and i have terrible aim but it hit him on the forehead and I didn’t mean to do it so I apologized but they still wouldn’t fucking leave so I chucked my pillows at him and I started screaming and kicking my legs like a child having a tantrum and I got my mom on the shin and she made a huge show of limping out of the room and then my brother still wouldn’t fucking leave and he just kept silently staring at me and wouldn’t tell me what he wanted and I kept screaming and trying to make him go and even tried to physically shove him out of the door but he’s stronger than me and I could only get him to budge a little bit and so I tried to close the door but he stuck his hand there and he and my mom tried to keep me from closing the door and I kept saying please just stop just go and they fucking wouldn’t and my mom was like “owww my hand” and I was like let go!!! But they fucking wouldn’t so eventually I stopped trying to close the door and my brother was just standing in the door way not saying anything and I said please go and he didn’t even move and I said I’m serious literally get out and he didn’t so I uncapped my water bottle and poured it on his head and drenched him in water. My mom started screeching and she kicked me and said to me “you’re just like your dad you’re exactly like your dad” and I was like can you please just fucking go and they still didn’t so I ran to the garage and I was going to run somewhere but I have nowhere to go and no friends and I didn’t bring a mask and my brother followed me so I went out to the backyard and when he got out there I ran back into the garage and locked him outside. When I went back to my room my mom was gone so I went back in and locked the door. And I’ve spent the whole day here.

2729066627369758,"6745. I thought I met the love of my life a year ago. But as it turns out, love isn’t real. We started off all cute and were the couple our friends admired, but it didn't take long for everything to fall apart. I started to see a new side of him; the side of him that wouldn't walk me home from Soda Hall at 3am. The side of him that wouldn’t respond to my messages for a week. The side of him that would flirt with the barista at UCha, right in front of my face.
Earlier this year, as I would go on my daily Taco Bell on Durant trip with my boyfriend, I saw this couple walking by every day. He was a scrawny Indian boy and she was this olive-skinned girl with wavy hair. Some days they would sit at La Burritta, discussing philosophy over their chips and salsa. Others they’d simply walk by.
But that wasn’t what stood out to me. Every day I watched, he walked her every day, and walked back alone, avoiding the homeless people as though with fear. I wanted to know why he was willing to do that, every single day. Isn't that weird? My boyfriend wouldn't do that for me, what makes her so special?
So one day I followed them. I told my boyfriend I had a paper to finish, and I ran away. I don’t what he thought I was actually doing since I wasn’t running in the right direction. I saw him walk her slowly, close together as if they had a secret to hide. When they arrived at Unit 2, he walked her into the building, and they stayed there for a couple of minutes. Then he walked out, and continued his path past Asian Ghetto, as he always did.
I decided to stay though. I walked into her dorm, I don’t remember which building it’s called but I think it started with a U.
I walked to every floor, trying to see if she was there. I finally saw her on one of the highest floors, and she was with some other boys. Her demeanor was enthusiastic, touchy, flirty even. I could that they were all reciprocating her interest. She treated them just like she treated the scrawny boy with hickeys.
I knew at that moment, this girl wasn’t meant for love. If this girl, who was in such a committed relationship with the scrawny boy, wasn’t meant for love, were any of us? Are any of us? He thought he was meant for love but he wasn’t. And if he wasn’t I wasn’t.
I texted my boyfriend that night and said we were done. I blocked him too. None of us are meant for love. The happiest couples, as they seem, aren’t that happy at all. Why are we, as a society, obsessed with the fact we have to find one person and stay with them forever? Why do we need love? We don’t. And it’s not real. The only thing that’s real is the California burrito from La Burritta (Southside)","6745. I thought I met the love of my life a year ago. But as it turns out, love isn’t real.

Even though I know what everything is in my head, it just LOOKS so complicated and it makes me feel like I'm big brain lmao.
Also, if you are a humanities major and you think I am trying to say STEM is cooler I'm not lol, so please don't be butt hurt. I just think STEM classes can be super cool in their own (underrated) way!",,1595451655,,,74,14,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2729066040703150&id=2156420374634389,

E. Lindsay Yang from CS188 is honestly one of my favorite TAs at Berkeley. She does a great job of keeping the positive energy up, while also being kind of dorky (in a good way)!

G. Michelle the 61B haed TA is so nice and cute. Watch her lab and homework video workthrough if you don't believe me (lowkey watched it three times so that I can get a better understanding of the material). God bless her!
H. Albert Yu is an amazing cs188 ta. He's always available to help and seems to really enjoy helping students to learn. This shows in his levels of Piazza engagement. I just wanted people to know what a legend this guy is.","6743. (WHOLESOME WEDNESDAY)

2728467637429657,"6738. So my partner is seeing someone. Which is fine cause we're in a strong long-term open relationship. We each have seen other people before but it's always been people the other person doesn't know closely.
Throughout quarantine, my partner and I (who live together) have been meeting a small group of friends to play DnD so that we aren't all depressed etc. As our group is consistently the same 5-6 people and we are all conscious and careful in public, it has been at least impressionally safe. In fact, compared to the co-op I lived in, this small communion of nerds is much safer than my situation when I was up in Berkeley.
The thing is my partner started dating one of the other guys in the group and while I am usually adverse to PDA he has no problem cuddling and even kissing my partner in front of me.
I was honest when my partner asked if I was ok, and I said that I didn't feel comfortable seeing it right in front of me (which has never happened before) but also I know I haven't a right to police their actions or relationships., But I have since been skipping a lot of the game nights and now my partner spends several days at a time at his house, and I have been alone taking care of the garden they started and their cat for them while they are at this guy's house.
Really I don't know if any of this would bother me if I had my own car or the ability to see other people myself and not be so alone or at least be able to buy more pot to occupy my time alone. As it is, I am miles outside of town with no transportation. I am even outside the range of any pot or even restaraunt delivery.
For the first time in our relationship I am starting to resent them seeing other people.
I know it's not fair and I want them to be happy, and really I need to control my own reactions and emotions, and I've talked to them about this but there really doesn't seem to be a solution besides demanding that they stay here with me so we can be depressed together which is unhealthy and unfair.

Anyway, I hope none of this came off the wrong way, but I’ve been able to really appreciate the world beyond my dumbass conservative suburb at Cal and I’m very grateful to anyone that has shared a little bit of their experience with me instead of dismissing me as a dumb white boy lol.

2727637387512682,"6726. this is a hate letter to indian boys. Growing up as an Indian girl, I've been lucky enough not to be in a family that conforms to the archaic stereotype that boys are better than girls. I've been lucky to be raised in the Bay Area, where my gender isn't something that makes me less than (at least, not every day).
So when an Indian (/South Asian, this problem is pervasive af) boy has the AUDACITY to make me feel less than, to make me feel as if I'm an imposter, to automatically assume that his decision is right, with no regard for my opinions, I rightfully get VERY PISSED OFF.
Indian communities CODDLE Indian boys, to the point that they think they can do no wrong. Even though I've been lucky, my friends (fellow Indian girls of the struggle themselves) are frequently demeaned, told to ""go back to the kitchen"", literally having their voices silenced because for some reason, Indian families can't even fathom the idea that girls can be humans too, instead of just dishwashers, launderers, cookers, etc etc. I'm frankly astounded at how much hate Indian girls have to go through from the people who are supposed to love them the most: their family. It'd be one thing if it was just our parents. It could die down eventually. But when the boys, the ones who get to go out all the time, the ones who don't constantly have their actions scrutinized by the community, literally the ones who get more resources, and the ones who are not the victims of FEMALE INFANTICIDE are ALSO perpetrating this inequality to their female peers, my blood literally starts to boil.
How is it that despite getting a good education, wanting for nothing, being a little raja in your household, you can't stand to see an Indian girl achieve the same things as you without having to demean her? Is there nowhere an Indian girl can simply exist without having to be confronted by this stifling mindset?
If I ever hear ""are you sure you're experienced enough to do this?"" or ""maybe you should let me handle [the coding/the logic/the calculations]"" from an Indian boy at Berkeley again, I will literally go feral. You're at Berkeley. You're smart. Do better. Be better than that.
It goes further than just imposter syndrome though. If you are an indian boy. treat the indian girls in your life with more respect. listen to them as you would your male friends. make the change in your life, bc that's the only way things are gonna change. thank you for coming to my ted talk.

I’ve tried to tell some of my friends about it, but the consensus seemed to be, I should feel lucky, I mean I got lucky right? Waking up to sex is great! But I don’t feel great... I don’t like being touched in the morning at all, by anyone anymore...(lol I know this is a weird hang-up) I’m afraid that this is going to affect a future relationship.

2726826164260471,"6718. “Can someone explain how my Asian immigrant parents were able to become rich & successful in America despite discrimination? How is this different from what black people face?”
If you were getting ready to flame me just for asking this question, SHAME ON YOU. Genuine people are wondering this, and if we call them racist for asking, or tell them to educate themselves, we give right-wingers reason to believe we don’t have a good response.
I’m gonna provide an earnest answer to this question, drawing a meaningful distinction between blacks and other successful minorities, and showing why black people are not in any way to “blame” for their own current predicament.
First of all, discrimination affects groups differently, so in this “experiment”, we can’t treat it as a controlled variable. All minorities face casual racism and unfair portrayals in the media. Yet Asians, for example, uniquely face the “perpetual foreigner” microaggression that no other group can relate to. Black people face their own unique forms of discrimination such as police targeting, and bias in hiring (Asians face this in the sense that they are often assumed to be introverted, but the point I’m trying to drive home is that there are different /types/ of discrimination).
So maybe different types of discrimination could explain the differences in outcome? Well, not entirely. Some “black” groups like Nigerian-Americans and Ghanaian-Americans look “black” and are thus obviously subject to the same discrimination as the 80% of blacks who are descendants of American slaves (from here on: African-Americans), but Nigerians and Ghanaians have incomes that are /higher/ than the national average. Thus, there must be some explanation besides present-day discrimination (things like resume screens and police brutality).
So that brings us to the /inherited/ difficulties that African-Americans face, and that’s a story that starts with slavery. We all know how bad slavery was to the individuals, but I think the civilizational trauma inflicted on African-Americans is still understated. Literally NOWHERE else in history has a group been so thoroughly stripped of any previous identity they had, and forced to start from scratch. In bondage, Africans from basically the entire continent were mixed together, and had their languages, religions, customs, values, traditions, family bonds, and ethnic ties completely removed. Their children were born without a cultural identity, living the absolute barest form of human existence. Millions of people existed like this for over 200 years, never having even a chance to advance themselves. In 1865, when these millions of slaves were freed, they had no common heroes, stories, values, or anything that typically binds an ethnic group together.
Furthermore, the systems they faced throughout the next 100 years such as segregation, exclusion from housing, capital, and education, and medical racism were simply undeniably created to hold down this group as they tried to emerge from slavery and form a culture that could join the fabric of mainstream society.
I’ve been talking as though African-Americans were a single unified bloc, and they may have identified as such, but this was an identity that had only very recently emerged, and didn’t have much to center around besides the fact that they were all previously slaves. In your mind, compare this to what it means to be your ethnicity, and how strong that can make a community when they share values, traditions, etc. that go back hundreds or thousands of years. Japanese people, for example, can point to the literary, artistic, and architectural works of their ancestors from a thousand years before Columbus – any African-American doesn’t know anything about their ancestry that’s more specific than “Africa”.
Despite their loose collectivity and a state actively trying to keep them down, black people did manage to make some gains, in the process opening the door for new minority groups to enter the US in earnest.
-----------------------------------
But wait, you may interrupt me here, why does it matter whether you have a strong culture or whatever? Shouldn’t everyone just do the best they can regardless of their situation? I would respond that this is indeed what any individual black person should do, and it is indeed what black people have done for their entire existence, as there is a black middle class and upper class. But being part of an ethnic community gives access to certain values that can help the group as a whole (and help us to explain the massive differences in average group outcomes) – say, Confucian belief that stresses filial piety, or Jewish culture which emphasizes legalism. African-American culture doesn’t /lack/ values like these, but it hasn’t had the centuries of experience to refine, entrench, and propagate them. Remember, slavery led to an ethnic group that basically needed to start everything from scratch less than 200 years ago.
Ok, I hear you respond, sounds like their culture is the problem, why don’t they just make a better culture? I’m [insert high-income ethnicity] and we value education, wouldn’t that help? Ok so I would agree that any individual black person /should/ value education, but that doesn’t solve group-level differences, and an entire culture can’t be changed by any individual.
There have in fact been active efforts to build a stronger African-American identity – think Kwanzaa, a deliberate creation designed to give black people something to celebrate in opposition to Christmas. Or basing a black identity around Islam (which is the reason black people often have Arabic names like Jamal). But you should be able to tell from these examples that artificial attempts to create a culture don’t really work at all (more broadly, we can point to Mao’s botched Cultural Revolution, or the USSR’s failed state atheism). This type of change takes time, and it can’t be forced by one leader or one organization.
So that leads us to the present – the worst eras of systemic racism against black people aren’t /that/ long ago, we’re only ~5 generations away from slavery, and MLKJ would likely still be alive today if he wasn’t assassinated. The present-day forms of discrimination are different between black people and what other immigrant families face, and African-Americans are still in the process of developing an identity to rally around after theirs were stolen from them during slavery. This movement and these discussions are part of the process. Black people’s average group outcomes are not the fault of any individual black person, it’s not the fault of black culture, and it most certainly isn’t because of any intrinsic part of being black, it’s the result of historical injustice, and the recovery process must be long. The world is complicated, let’s treat it as such.
I hope I didn’t make any faulty arguments here. I also hope I was able to convincingly answer someone’s question, or at least show that the left does have an answer. Let’s start real conversations about these things, rather than calling anyone who asks racist. We don’t want scared “allies”, who learn what to avoid saying, but who will secretly wonder “but how did the Asians do it?”. No, we want converts. True believers who understand why we believe the things we do.","6718. “Can someone explain how my Asian immigrant parents were able to become rich & successful in America despite discrimination?

There have in fact been active efforts to build a stronger African-American identity – think Kwanzaa, a deliberate creation designed to give black people something to celebrate in opposition to Christmas. Or basing a black identity around Islam (which is the reason black people often have Arabic names like Jamal). But you should be able to tell from these examples that artificial attempts to create a culture don’t really work at all (more broadly, we can point to Mao’s botched Cultural Revolution, or the USSR’s failed state atheism). This type of change takes time, and it can’t be forced by one leader or one organization.
So that leads us to the present – the worst eras of systemic racism against black people aren’t /that/ long ago, we’re only ~5 generations away from slavery, and MLKJ would likely still be alive today if he wasn’t assassinated. The present-day forms of discrimination are different between black people and what other immigrant families face, and African-Americans are still in the process of developing an identity to rally around after theirs were stolen from them during slavery. This movement and these discussions are part of the process. Black people’s average group outcomes are not the fault of any individual black person, it’s not the fault of black culture, and it most certainly isn’t because of any intrinsic part of being black, it’s the result of historical injustice, and the recovery process must be long. The world is complicated, let’s treat it as such.
I hope I didn’t make any faulty arguments here. I also hope I was able to convincingly answer someone’s question, or at least show that the left does have an answer. Let’s start real conversations about these things, rather than calling anyone who asks racist. We don’t want scared “allies”, who learn what to avoid saying, but who will secretly wonder “but how did the Asians do it?”. No, we want converts. True believers who understand why we believe the things we do.",,1595214051,,,223,24,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2726826164260471&id=2156420374634389,

Well, it was a Pornhub video. I was about to quit out because I didn't want to get horny from watching porn (like come on, I'm trying to study here) but then I saw some really big boobs and immediately forgot about that. What can I say, I really like boobs.
Here's the cruel part; the woman lifted her shirt up, and right as she was about to show her nipples, the video cut to an actual calculus lecture. Like come on, I've got my dick out now, and now you decide bring out the math? I guess I should have noticed that ""u-substitution"" has the word ""tit"" in it.
There was no turning back at this point, so I proceeded to browse Pornhub for the next hour or so. When I returned to sanity after jerking off, I realized that I still didn't now what u-substitution was, but it was already 3 am, so I gave up.
Here's the worst part; I think my friend has conditioned some sort of Pavlovian response in me. Like, whenever I watch a video about u-substitution, I immediately get horny and have to jerk myself off. As you might be able to tell, I still don't know how to do u-subs.
I guess what I'm trying to say is, can someone teach me u-substitution? Like I'll be fucked harder than the people on Pornhub if I don't learn this by the final. Please help.","6717.

I feel like I'm choosing the lesser of two evils. I've been stuck at home with my parents since covid came to berkeley in march, and I feel like I've been going insane from seeing them every single day. I love them of course, but it's mostly from the fact that I haven't come out to them yet because they're homophobic (asian immigrants who grew up in a different culture). I've been putting off coming out for years mostly because I'm straight up scared of anything bad that might happen (arguing, fighting, maybe getting kicked out but I doubt that far).
All my friends and my sis already know, and they've helped me stay sane because I would spend most of my days with them in high school and at Berkeley more than I would with my parents. But now that I know I'll be spending fall semester online, I don't know if I could handle being around them 24/7, especially after my friends leave for college in the fall and since my sister doesn't live with us anymore. It's already tough enough as it is since we went home during last spring semester. Being around my parents without seeing my friends and sis as much makes me feel like I can't breathe.
Basically, I feel like I'm stuck with a choice. I can either not come out and suffer mentally because I can't be honest with the people whom I will be around constantly for the next 6 months. Or, I can finally do something I've been putting off for years, coming out to them, and hope that at least the honesty won't make me feel like I'm drowning anymore. I'm leaning towards the second choice both because (1) the opportunity presented itself) and (2) I love my parents and don't want to lie to them anymore, but it's not necessarily something I would've done now if corona hadn't come around.
I don't know if other people here would also have experienced this since, I mean, covid is not a usual occurrence, but any help/advice/tips is helpful. Thanks guys :)","6713. tl;dr coming out to homophobic parents due to corona

2726074751002279,"6708. I feel terrible for thinking this but I need genuine advice and I don't know who to go to. Thus, a confession.
Me and my girlfriend have been dating ever since my mid highschool senior year. I am now an incoming sophomore, and she is an incoming senior in high school (we're two grade levels apart). We've been dating for about one and a half years now. I love her to death - we're the couple that are each other's best friends. We have the same exact humor, a billion inside jokes, and can talk about nothing for hours. I honestly could see myself living the rest of my life with her - I want to wake up in the morning with her cuddled around me. I want to cook with her, play video games with her, have sexytimes without getting cut short due to time. We've lasted through long distance which was tough but we managed. We tell each other our deepest secrets. And we've yet to have a single fight - there are times where we've been hurt by each other, but not a single time have we given each other the silent treatment, stormed off in anger, or just any kind of raised voices or anything related to an argument. So much is pointing to how perfect she is and how I want to spend the rest of my life with her.
But there is a lot about our relationship that is just fundamentally unfulfilling simply due to our age gap and circumstances. And this is why I'm conflicted, because I love her so so much but I feel like I'm being incredibly selfish and ungrateful by 'complaining' about this. So if you're reading this I'd really like your honest advice.
We are each other's first everything. First girlfriend/boyfriend, first date, first kiss, etc. When I first asked her out mid senior year, it was because I had a mild crush on her, never dated anyone before and yknow, it was my senior year. I wanted to try something new. I didn't expect it to last past the summer - I assumed it would be fun but we'd break up before I left for college. We were both under the impression it wouldn't be a longterm relationship. And now that it is, I'm not unhappy, on the contrary I'm so happy we got to this point. But I'm also scared of commitment. I know marriage is far off, but I never would have imagined even considering marrying the first person I dated. I know this sounds selfish, but I really want the experience. I want to date at least a couple of different girls before I find the One. And another thing, is that I want a normal dating experience. Me and my girlfriend's relationship isn't normal in a lot of ways.
When we first started dating, she wanted to keep it a secret because she's a naturally shy and secretive person. I had no problem with that, especially considering it wasn't going to last anyways. We had fun times during my last semester of highschool, but none of either of our friends knew we were dating. We went on dates over the summer, and at the end decided to keep dating, because things were going well and we could always break off if something happens. We've talked about the status of our secret relationship much since then and have decided that it isn't a secret anymore. But it still is. Most of my college friends know about her, but none of her friends know about me. She's so secretive that unless someone asks her directly, she'll never bring me up or acknowledge that I exist (as a boyfriend). None of her friends have any clue, and I am actually friends with some of her friends because we went to the same high school. So, I wouldn't dare to post anything on social media about us because both college and high school friends follow me, and none of my highschool friends know. And it's not that I care about social media - I don't use it often at all, actually. It's just that I can't be public about the person I love, so it still feels like I'm in a secret relationship, despite the fact that we're one and a half years in.
And speaking of secret, while her parents know that we're dating, my parents have no clue, and I intend to keep it that way (unless we marry, which is another point). My parents are incredibly rude and judgmental and would try extremely hard to prevent our relationship if they were to ever find out. Not because they dislike the idea of me dating, but rather because of our age gap, I'm a college student and she's still in high school, they feel like she'd weigh me down. I need to be free and explore college, not get tied with some highschool chick. And, they are also very subjective, and... I think my girlfriend is beautiful but objectively speaking, she's not the most attractive person in the world and my parents would say that I could ""do better"". If our relationship becomes any more serious than it is already, I don't know how I could break the news to my parents. It's just another barrier preventing me from going further with her.
Another thing is that our relationship has been almost entirely secret and long distance. We hung out during school my last semester, but not much since it was a secret. We hung out a lot during the summer, and that was one of the happiest summers of my life. But starting college and from then on, it's not going to get any better. Once I started college, since I'm out of state, we were reduced to entirely calls and texts. And like I said, we managed, and it was tough but if anything it made our relationship stronger. But it's just... If I decide she's the one, I'll never have a normal dating experience. I'll never get to wander around campus with my SO, I'll never get to sit next to her in class and distract her from lecture. I'll never get to study with her or invite her over to my dorm. I'll never get invited to social events together with her, where we arrive and everyone there knows we're dating, and it's natural. I'll never have the normal feeling, the normal identity of 'someone that's dating someone else'. She's going to be a senior this fall, and that means she's applying to colleges, and she's going to apply to Cal. But there's no guarantee that she'll choose it, and even if she does, she'll be entering Cal as a freshman while I'll be a junior. Then, we might finally have a normal dating experience, but it still won't be the same. Two years isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things, but it's a lot now. We're in different stages of our life. She'd just be starting college while I just became an upperclassmen. We have really compatible personalities and senses of humor, but there are still subtle differences I can tell in our interactions that clearly shows the age gap. For instance, she's uncomfortable with swearing, inappropriate humor, drinking and drugs, and I know that people in college are like that too. And I'm not a crazy partier or drug addict, but what I loved about college was that I felt so much more freedom to do what I wanted to do. Everyone was so down for going on 2am boba runs or randomly traveling to SF or pulling all nighters just to hang out with friends. But I know she's a lot more reserved about that kind of stuff. A lot of my friends have had jobs or currently do, so they don't mind spending a little on boba every now and then. A lot of my friends can also drive, and while this doesn't really apply to Berkeley, it's just a lot easier to get around with a car and a license. But she's never had a job, so she never wants to spend money on anything including activities that cost money, such as going to SF or karaoke. When I'm back home, we'd never be able to drive to anyplace, and mostly just hung out at her house. Basically I sound terrible but I'm not trying to force her to spend money to hang out with me, I know there are free things we can do. I just pointed it out to show clear independence differences due to our ages. And I honestly want to someday date someone where we both have autonomy over our actions, and it'll feel less like ""we can't watch a movie because our parents can't pick us up"" and more ""we're both adults, we both can take care of ourselves, be independent and have fun"". Its something that has honestly been itching at me our entire relationship, despite the fact that everything about her unrelated to our circumstances is perfect.
I love her, I probably sound super hypocritical but I really love her with the bottom of my heart and I can't imagine breaking up with her because I don't know what I'd do without our daily calls. But is it wrong of me to wish that I hope in the future I can date other people in the same stage of life as me? Where I won't have to hide our relationship, where I can introduce them to my parents without worry, where I won't be in long distance with them and we can spend our day to day lives together, as students going to the same school? I really want that, but I also really want her and I feel bad because I feel like I should prioritize her over those kinds of traditional experiences. I don't know what to do.","6708.

I think my girlfriend is beautiful but objectively speaking, she's not the most attractive person in the world and my parents would say that I could ""do better"". If our relationship becomes any more serious than it is already, I don't know how I could break the news to my parents. It's just another barrier preventing me from going further with her.
Another thing is that our relationship has been almost entirely secret and long distance. We hung out during school my last semester, but not much since it was a secret. We hung out a lot during the summer, and that was one of the happiest summers of my life. But starting college and from then on, it's not going to get any better. Once I started college, since I'm out of state, we were reduced to entirely calls and texts. And like I said, we managed, and it was tough but if anything it made our relationship stronger. But it's just... If I decide she's the one, I'll never have a normal dating experience. I'll never get to wander around campus with my SO, I'll never get to sit next to her in class and distract her from lecture. I'll never get to study with her or invite her over to my dorm. I'll never get invited to social events together with her, where we arrive and everyone there knows we're dating, and it's natural. I'll never have the normal feeling, the normal identity of 'someone that's dating someone else'. She's going to be a senior this fall, and that means she's applying to colleges, and she's going to apply to Cal. But there's no guarantee that she'll choose it, and even if she does, she'll be entering Cal as a freshman while I'll be a junior. Then, we might finally have a normal dating experience, but it still won't be the same. Two years isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things, but it's a lot now. We're in different stages of our life. She'd just be starting college while I just became an upperclassmen. We have really compatible personalities and senses of humor, but there are still subtle differences I can tell in our interactions that clearly shows the age gap. For instance, she's uncomfortable with swearing, inappropriate humor, drinking and drugs, and I know that people in college are like that too. And I'm not a crazy partier or drug addict, but what I loved about college was that I felt so much more freedom to do what I wanted to do. Everyone was so down for going on 2am boba runs or randomly traveling to SF or pulling all nighters just to hang out with friends. But I know she's a lot more reserved about that kind of stuff. A lot of my friends have had jobs or currently do, so they don't mind spending a little on boba every now and then. A lot of my friends can also drive, and while this doesn't really apply to Berkeley, it's just a lot easier to get around with a car and a license. But she's never had a job, so she never wants to spend money on anything including activities that cost money, such as going to SF or karaoke. When I'm back home, we'd never be able to drive to anyplace, and mostly just hung out at her house. Basically I sound terrible but I'm not trying to force her to spend money to hang out with me, I know there are free things we can do. I just pointed it out to show clear independence differences due to our ages. And I honestly want to someday date someone where we both have autonomy over our actions, and it'll feel less like ""we can't watch a movie because our parents can't pick us up"" and more ""we're both adults, we both can take care of ourselves, be independent and have fun"". Its something that has honestly been itching at me our entire relationship, despite the fact that everything about her unrelated to our circumstances is perfect.
I love her, I probably sound super hypocritical but I really love her with the bottom of my heart and I can't imagine breaking up with her because I don't know what I'd do without our daily calls. But is it wrong of me to wish that I hope in the future I can date other people in the same stage of life as me? Where I won't have to hide our relationship, where I can introduce them to my parents without worry, where I won't be in long distance with them and we can spend our day to day lives together, as students going to the same school? I really want that, but I also really want her and I feel bad because I feel like I should prioritize her over those kinds of traditional experiences. I don't know what to do.",,1595127603,,,27,21,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2726074751002279&id=2156420374634389,

2726072954335792,"6706. Going off of Confession #6431...to all the incoming freshman ladies, here are some of my ""big sister""ly tips regarding things that me and some of my friends wish we knew REGARDING MEN before coming to Cal:
1 - I would highly advise against jumping into a relationship your first semester in college, especially with someone who lives on your floor/in your building. If things go awry between the two of you (in most cases they do), it is always extremely awkward to have to see them all the time for the remainder of freshman year. The same logic applies for hooking up.
2 - If you go to a frat party and get hit on by an upperclassman guy, I would advise you to proceed with caution. It's very likely that they're preying on your perceived innocence/inexperience, and they are often extremely creepy.
3 - Please don't join Greek life JUST to meet frat boys--personality-wise, most of them are just not it, sis.
4 - If you are coming into college as a virgin, please don't let ANY guy coerce you into having sex with them. I've dealt with this multiple times with horny Cal boys who knew that I was and they either shamed me for not putting out, tried to pressure me, or ghosted me after the first date. Anyone who does any of the above is not worth your time.
5 - If you're looking for a relationship, having sex with a guy is NOT going to make him commit--he needs to be either in love with you or have a very strong emotional connection with you to want to lock you down (or in certain cases, sucking his dick like his cum is your only source of oxygen can work too). Don't fall for their affectionate gestures (e.g. kisses on the forehead, cuddles) or taking you out to dinner dates as signals that they want something serious--fuckboys have evolved, like any disease, and will do or say almost anything to get you to fuck them. Unless he has verbally expressed that he wants commitment, y'all are not exclusive so feel free to go on dates with whomever you want. As I like to say, ""you are a hole to him unless proven otherwise."" I know it sounds vulgar, but it's the truth.
6 - If a guy ABSOLUTELY SUCKS at kissing/making out, I'm just going to tell you in advance that it's not gonna get better (as in, he's going to suck at everything else e.g. fucking). How can you expect him to eat pussy right if he can't even bother to get the most BASIC of sexual moves right?
.
.
Alrighty ladies I think that's all I got for now. I do realize that this entire list revolves around negative experiences with men, but I don't want this to completely discourage you from getting some sweet lovin' because there are also plenty of really amazing, wholesome men in the Cal population. Or if you've given up on Cal boys like I have, you can hop on a dating app and find someone hot in SF (I'd recommend Hinge) or pursue a long distance relationship with someone at a different school (I have friends who are doing this and things seem to be going really well). I hope y'all have the best first year--and stay sexy ;)","6706.

Especially after a particularly busy day my thoughts race, the sorts of thoughts we all have about our place in the universe.

Anecdotes about personal relationships, activities and places people are passionate about, snippets of opinions on the human condition, ponderings on religious ideals, anguished post-heartbreak monologues, dedications to the underappreciated hard workers in our lives.

No offense but I'm finding it very hard after 2 years to adjust to Cal :( One of the reasons I came to this school was because I am trans (albeit not officially with the surgery), so I thought people would be more accepting here, and some are, but a lot aren't.

I was raised very sheltered so I'm not like everybody else at Berkeley who says they know so much about social issues. My whole life I learned that there was only two biological sexes, and two genders, but either sex can identify with either gender.

Coming to Cal, I've been wanting to learn more about gender identity and the idea of more than 2 genders but every time I ask/talk about it I get shut down and people *basically* say I'm not their ""ideal"" trans person (not in those exact words, but around it). I'm just tired of everyone pretending to be my friend then dumping me when I'm not as educated or whatever as they thought I'd be. Not every trans person is a well-educated activist!!!

I was accused of sexual assault.
I was always very much in support of the idea of Believing All Women. I still want to be. I felt like I’ve always had a very good grasp of consent and that I’ve always treated partners with respect. When I first heard of the accusation, my first feeling was shock and disgust- at myself. How could I have made someone feel this way? I wanted to reach out and talk to my previous partner. I wanted to know what I did to make them feel this way- to apologize if I truly did something wrong. I’d heard that they didn’t want to talk, which is absolutely understandable. But as I heard more about the accusation, I realized I had no recollection of the claimed incident. The claim was that I was blacked out when the incident occurred but I know for a fact I had never blacked out in that period of time. I don’t want to outright call them a liar, but I honestly don’t understand where the accusation came from.
I really don’t know what to do. I want to reach out so badly but I don’t want to hurt them further since they obviously believe their version of the claimed incident, nor do I want to escalate things. I honestly don’t believe that such an incident ever occurred and I’m so tired of living in fear of them going public with the claims.

Now I'm starting to see that afirmative action is not ""taking the spot away"" from a qualified applicant, it's setting the playing field equal between all races and socioeconomic circumstances. (Educate me if I'm wrong but ACA-5 addresses both race and gender, so it's not just a ""race issue"") And honestly, it was at this moment that I realized I was the one probably taking the spot away from a qualified applicant who was less fortunate than me in playing the lotteries of life. Of course, affirmative action will probably mean that the number of overrepresented populations (ie Asians, Whites) will decrease but not because the spots were taken, but that considering all the circumstances one faces in life, such applicants were less qualified than others. (Of course, there's a whole another problem of rating people holistically)
Most of the qualified and hardworking Asian Americans in my life did make it into elite private colleges where affirmative action exists. If you are criticizing the affirmative action system, take a step back and evaluate yourself critically. Ask yourself if I was a woman, if I was Black, if I was less financially secure, would I have been accomplishing the same things? By doing this, I realized that I shouldn't blame the system for my own shortcomings.
As messy as it is, I think the US college admissions system is better than others for the reason that it considers you and your accomplishments in light of your circumstances. Take a look at Europe, where they start dividing the straight A students at an early age, or at Asia where scores on a national exam determine your life. Test scores may be equal, but they cannot be equitable.","6693. I used to think affirmative action was just a way to limit the number of Asian Americans in elite colleges.

My brother is a gaming addict and my parents are super strict, so they had the brilliant (dumb) idea of unplugging the WiFi router in our house every night and replugging in the morning around 9 AM cause my dad needs it to work (he works from home now). As an extreme night owl who uses the internet mostly at night and usually watches something before falling asleep, I’ve been doing horrible. It’s been getting super lonely at night and it’s starting to affect my mental health. I was looking into a secondary router to purchase off amazon or eBay, but is it really worth it to buy it for until I go to college? I don’t know how long my parents plan on doing this and as a broke student the routers are ranging from the cheapest being $60. But hear me out. NOW, my parents are starting to unplug the WiFi router whenever they feel like it and is threatening to physically beat me up if I don’t get out of bed the time THEY want me to. Unplugging the WiFi router every night may also damage it and might not work properly eventually. I tried talking to my parents but they do not listen to logic and could care less when they see me cry or when I explain it’s taking a toll on my mental health. I also need this for school related things like class registration, keeping up with the situation at school, teaching out to professors, etc. Nope. They don’t listen one bit. What should I do? I have no control over my brother and my parents don’t listen to logic or reasoning. They want everything to go their way and are kinda like tyrants IMO.

2724340461175708,"6689. I hate how someone can easily oversexualize a friendship. Like they see their two friends getting along pretty well and instantly decide that there’s romantic/ sexual attraction going on. Maybe I just don’t like you enough to be able to interact with you that way. Maybe you never made a comfortable enough environment for me to truly be able to express myself. I mean there’s so many factors why you interact with someone differently than you do others. But does it really HAVE to go straight to sexual attraction? I don’t think so. I feel like this has so much potential to ruin a friendship- an honest, wholesome, and amazing friendship.
There’s so much projection that goes on when you just assume that someone has romantic/sexual feelings for another and it's worse when you push those thoughts into those in that friendship. Some people just don’t realize that two people can ACTUALLY be friends and just that. Maybe one has those thoughts, but even then, they should not be pressured or given these false premises from the outsider who wants to project and insert themselves into another relationship. There is something called being a decent human.
For example:
I’m at a boba place, and I think to myself, “I should buy this for my friend”. Does that mean I’m desperately in love with them? No. Does that mean I want to ;))))))) (do the nasty) with them? No. Does that mean I just really appreciate my friend and want to share a drink with them? Yes :) because I am a wholesome person!!!!!!! (whaaaaaa- you can be nice to someone and not want to woohoo with them?)
Idk. Maybe mind your own business. If my friend wants to confess their undying and everlasting love for me, it better be because they decided that it was their time to. Not because you pushed all these thoughts and sculpted this type of world into their mind. If a friendship takes a natural turn into a romantic one, then so be it. But it better not be because someone stuck their nose somewhere it didn’t belong and turned a friendship into something it wasn’t. ALSO everyone has their own experiences that shape the way they view things, it’s just not right to assume that one can accurately understand how another person feels about a particular situation.

I love my friends, but I feel so fucking lonely. My relationships with all of my friends are purely banterous, and while I do have a lot of fun with them, I feel like I don't have a genuine deep emotional relationship with any of them. We never talk about really personal stuff, so how can I just bring up the fact that I'm on the brink of depression? In all of the time I've been at Berkeley, nobody has spent the 2 seconds to ask me how I'm doing, so I feel like it doesn't matter to them. To give benefit of the doubt, maybe they do care but it's too weird to talk about.
You are probably reading this post, thinking I am not one of your friends, so you don't need to do anything. I'm pretty sure my friends will disregard this post, and won't say anything (just want to add that i will be devastated if one of my friends reacts/comments on this confession without reaching out). Even if you don't think I'm one of your friends, you might have other friends like me, who are desperately looking for a sign that someone cares. Let's please try to normalize checking each other's mental health. SO PLEASE. Check up on your homies right now. You won't know how they're REALLY doing unless you ask.","6674.

a. I MISS MADDI BROWN SO MUCH!! She was a senior on my team (yeah cal crew!!) and her season got cut short so she had to go back to Australia (big sad). With that beings said, she was an INCREDIBLE mentor, a leader, and amazing friend. I miss hanging out with her, and it breaks my heart that I'll never row with her again...hope she's doing well (sad reax)
b. EVA SABINE IS A QUEEN! I miss her dearly. We got close last year after going through some shit and a mutual love of memes/crackhead hours. She's one of those gals that just puts a smile on your face...and ya need that in moments like these. MISS YOU!!!
c. Scott Niue is the god of chem 12b. He answers pretty much every question on piazza and I would like to thank him for carrying all of us through these rough times.
d. Can I just shout out Professor Lin Lin real quick? He is probably my most thoughtful professor for a STEM class this semester. He moved his lecture online before even the administration made it mandatory; cancelled Midterm 2 so he could figure out logistics and not leave us hanging; sent out polls asking students what technology they'd have access to and what time zone they expected to be in during finals week; then accordingly sent out an updated course policy taking into account all these considerations. My other STEM profs have made a few concessions but his by far are the most generous. I'm in a very different time zone right now and I really appreciate the obvious thought he's put into this. There are people in much more stressful situations than me and I hope they receive the support and accommodations they need.
And a shoutout to all the professors and instructors and GSIs who understand that these are crazy times and are working to make this easier for us. At the end of this pandemic, I may not remember the details of what you taught me. But I will remember that you cared.
e. My DeCal facilitator Amy Chiu has such a nice smile and is really cool!!
f. I have a huge crush on Ben Clifner. He’s probably the best person I’ve met on this campus; his personality is magnetic. He is so kind and genuine. He deserves the world.
g. ASUC Senator Romario has been putting in so much work for financial support during this pandemic, just wanted that king to know we appreciate him.","6673. (WHOLESOME WEDNESDAY)

2723477801261974,"6672. TW: Rape, Sexual Abuse, Language
TL;DR: I was raped by a younger girl. It's hurting me. I am scared to talk about this with my friends since most likely they'll just shrug it off as I am a dude. And most importantly, I'm reminded of that night every time I do it with the person that I like.
Also: If you're my best friend reading this, please do not be worried, I'm dealing in my own way. If some of y'all were in that party and somehow recognize/remember us, please do not do anything that hurts the other person emotionally or physically.
This dates back to last year before the world plunged into a series of unfortunate events. I was doing homework in my apartment. And my best friend (mentioned above) hit me up at around nine in the evening asking me if I was down to go to a party. I finished my homework half an hour before midnight, and decided that maybe I deserve some alcohol in me. I arrive, and it's all cool. I met up with my best friend and some of her female friends. Almost half the people were already drunk at that time, my best friend and her friends told me I needed to catch up. I grew up in Asia, and years of drinking have taught me about my body and its own limits. I start the night slow, taking sips of vodka and whiskey about every five minutes or so. Then the girls with me decided to go play card games in the couch. At this point, it's about 2AM and I'm tipsy so why the fuck not. So I play with my best friend, and two other girls that I have never seen in my life prior to this night. So we play a drinking game, and I ended up losing a bunch. My best friend then noticed that one of her friends started getting touchy with me. My best friend knows that I wasn't down to do any of those that night cause I told her, so she calls her out. She tells her, ""don't touch him too much, he's not about that"" or some shit like that. At this point, I'm barely able to speak up. I could hear some of the conversations, but just fragments.
Then my mind goes into a time-skip. It is now the end of the party, and based on our condition, my best friend decided we just sleepover in the house. One of her friends already went home, so it was just me, her and her other friend. We go into one of the rooms, and there was a mattress on the floor, so we decided to pass out in there. Her friend took the rightmost part of the bed where the outlets were so she can charge her phone, and my best friend took the middle. I took the remaining bed and some of the floor. So I passed out just like that. Then at some point, I regain consciousness because this girl in the dark is now next to me touching my penis. I turn my head to see her face, and it's my best friend's friend from what I gathered. I'm still so fucking drunk at this point, my head is fucking spinning, then she proceeds to give me head. I told her, ""yo stop I'm really fucking drunk and tired"". But she kept going, and she couldn't get me hard as expected. I kept on telling her to stop, but she didn't. She went on top of me, and started grinding on me even though I wasn't hard. This lasted for what seemed to me was about 10 mins, and I knew I was passing out at some moments too. Then I regain a decent amount of consciousness again, and with all of my strength I tilt my head to see what the fuck is going on. I see her face next to my genital, as she's giving me a handjob. My thoughts at this point were messed up. What went into my mind was that she wont stop until I finish. So I told her, ""let me do it"". So I mustered every strength in my body, and I did finish.
We all woke up the next day. She acted like nothing happened. I went to my best friend's place to tell her all about it. I broke down in tears. She apologized for inviting me into the party and partly blames herself for not waking up when she was in the same room. My best friend cut her off after that. What hurts me the most is that every time I do it with someone I like, that night always flashes back and ruins everything. ALSO WHY ME? I'M A SOLID 6. THERE WERE DUDES IN THERE THAT WERE FAR MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN ME, AND/OR WERE PROBABLY LOOKING FOR THAT. WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE FUCKING ME?! This girl could have easily hooked up with a random in there since she's fairly attractive. SO WHY TF IT HAD TO BE ME?!
If you guys read this far, thank you so much. I really do appreciate it, at least I know that my voice is being heard. I tried to make this as long as I can because it is painful to write just the bad moments. This was my way of preparing myself emotionally to write at all. There are parts in this writing where I tried to be nonchalant (or be funny) because I am trying to keep a positive mindset while typing, but these kinds of things are in no way to be taken lightly. I know how bad it is first-hand. It felt like I was just digging up my own bad memories and experiences. I just finished writing, and now my hands are shaking and I am in tears, but my chest is slightly lighter. I call this a W.

Well, I guess I got my answer. I checked, she recently started talking to her friend again, her ex. Someone I know she will always love and it hurts me. Because I am seeing history repeat itself, just like what happened in my past relationship with another. A conversation that seemed like an innocent “How are you doing?” turns into reminiscing on past feelings. I desire to know what she wants from him.

My father voluntarily sold/gave away most of the land we used to have to his mostly black employees by the 1990s, leaving only a small plot which we tended to all by ourselves. The ZANU-PF veterans still gutted our house and committed those other unspeakable war crimes, finally gifting the last little plot to a local minister later suspected of embezzling funds intended for a clinic. He was able to find a job here as a consultant for installing irrigation systems, but his cynicism towards achieving racial justice for all shows in his response to community-based policing alternatives: ""I see that the police here target black people unfairly today, but what prevents communities from simply ignoring me due to my race if I get mugged or worse?""
My mother also understood that we could not continue sustaining ourselves with stolen land, and toiled day and night as soon as we came here so that we could build our own futures. She worked two dish-washing jobs while studying at night to become an actuary, and eventually secured a career that could pay for a condo and my college education. I thank her for constantly reminding me and my sister of the importance of education and self-reliance, but she's been worrying about revolutionary leftists (ie. actual Marxists and ancoms) inside racial justice movements overthrowing the entire US government and implementing a system that devolves into committing more Gukurahundis, eliminating civil liberties, and mismanaging the economy.
How can I reassure my parents that they can join as allies in the fight for racial justice without getting personally fleeced in return for their cooperation, knowing their unique circumstances as a family who unarguably had that exact experience already? They see the diabolical specter of Robert Mugabe and his impact everywhere they see racial inequality, and I don't know how I can help them separate the two.","6666.

He was able to find a job here as a consultant for installing irrigation systems, but his cynicism towards achieving racial justice for all shows in his response to community-based policing alternatives: ""I see that the police here target black people unfairly today, but what prevents communities from simply ignoring me due to my race if I get mugged or worse?""
My mother also understood that we could not continue sustaining ourselves with stolen land, and toiled day and night as soon as we came here so that we could build our own futures. She worked two dish-washing jobs while studying at night to become an actuary, and eventually secured a career that could pay for a condo and my college education. I thank her for constantly reminding me and my sister of the importance of education and self-reliance, but she's been worrying about revolutionary leftists (ie. actual Marxists and ancoms) inside racial justice movements overthrowing the entire US government and implementing a system that devolves into committing more Gukurahundis, eliminating civil liberties, and mismanaging the economy.
How can I reassure my parents that they can join as allies in the fight for racial justice without getting personally fleeced in return for their cooperation, knowing their unique circumstances as a family who unarguably had that exact experience already? They see the diabolical specter of Robert Mugabe and his impact everywhere they see racial inequality, and I don't know how I can help them separate the two.",,1594771222,,,20,4,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2722666034676484&id=2156420374634389,

My parents and I are well aware of this and try to support him as much as we can, but the comments others make (especially extended family and family friends) put him down make him feel “less valuable.”
For example, I did well in school, and my relatives would be very proud of me and tell him that he has such a smart brother and ask if he’s going to go to UC Berkeley as well (etc etc). He struggles in school and often makes comments of “why can’t I understand school like you do?” or “why is school so easy for you?” and he puts so much effort in to study and understand his classes, and is often discouraged when his grades don’t reflect that effort. He’s starting to give up.
Growing up, at our recitals our relatives (and even complete strangers!) would go up to me and congratulate me, saying how much they LOVED my music, and they would completely ignore my brother. (If not completely ignore him, then they’d tell him that they hope he plays just like me some day). One time my uncle even straight up said “your brother is so much better than you, isn’t he.” which made me very angry but I couldn’t say anything because I couldn’t disrespect him in front of the entire family.
My family is very aware of this, and as much as my parents and I try to support him, the abundance of comments outsiders make cause him to feel worthless. They don’t mean any harm, but the fact that they always congratulate me and brush him aside cannot possibly be helping. The worst part is that we can’t do anything to control what others say.

Over the past week, with the help of the influx of social media posts containing information as to how one can help the Black Lives Matter movement, it has become increasingly clearer to me how one can help social causes through multiple methods, whether it’s signing petitions, donating, volunteering, or sharing info. With that being said, I have honestly been feeling pretty discouraged by the gatekeeping that seems to exist in activist communities.
For context, I’m mostly a “lurker” when it comes to social media, meaning that I don’t frequently engage in tweeting, sharing posts on my IG/Snapchat story, etc. I just don’t feel the need to post anything and everything about my life (not saying there’s anything wrong with doing that, it is just that I am a reserved person in general). So when the tragedy occurred and people started sharing links to petitions, donation funds, and readings on anti-Blackness, I signed them, donated some monies since I had some available (shout-out to the CARES Act grant), and started reading them, but I didn’t share them. To me, posting my donation would give off the same disingenuous vibe when someone films themselves giving money to a homeless man. Then, I started seeing the countless posts from Berkeley students expressing the sentiment that if you are silent in times like these, you are deliberately choosing to side with the oppressor, and I just couldn’t help but feel bad because I felt like I wasn’t doing enough so I started retweeting and sharing posts pertaining to acts of police brutality at the protests and how to help with the Black Lives Matter movement. Then, I started seeing posts discussing “performative activism” and how harmful it can be, and I felt bad because I couldn’t help but feel like that was the impression I was giving off to people given my reserved social media posting history, despite the fact that I had already contributed to the cause through other means. Then, another Berkeley student on twitter tweeted something along the lines of “just know that we can see right through your performance, and how your current posts do not match your track record” and I couldn’t help but think... what the fuck? What is the right thing to do here??? You don’t say anything, and you’re considered a person that is complicit in the oppression of marginalized communities. You start speaking up about these issues on the internet, and you are considered a clout chaser. Plus, they gave off the same vibe as those pretentious music fans that say “i LiStENeD tO tHaT aRtiST bEfORe tHeY wEnT mAiNstReAm.” I don’t doubt that there exist people who only posted a black square and think they ended racism, but goddamn, what is the expectation here? I am legitimately confused and I do hope I can hear some thoughts on this. Are one’s non-online contributions invalid if their entire online persona isn’t based around the social causes they want to fight for? How many aesthetic guides for addressing white privilege/abolishing the police/contributing to BLM/etc does one need to share on their story until they stop being performative? Is it really not enough to keep up with these issues, staying informed, and taking action through other means aside from sharing?

Honestly fuck affirmative action. It discriminates against the asian community. Tell me why a black person has a higher chance of getting into an elite school like harvard, stanford, and berkeley while asians are discriminated against, EVEN THO THE ASIAN PERSON HAS BETTER STATS AND EXTRACURRICULARS. Affirmative action is basically institutionalized racism and it makes me so pissed.
Im a chinese asian american. My parents worked really hard and earn money and I study countless hours. And when I got accepted into Berkeley as a CS major, I was soo excited. I busted my ass off in hs and I got really good grades and had relevant extracurriculars and good essays. But I was only one of the few asians that got in. A lot of my asian friends didnt get into top schools, even though I knew some deserved it more than I did. But when I was talking to some of my black friends, they also got into Berkeley and other really elite schools (with the same major) even though they had lower gpas and practically no extracurriculars. Literally my asian friends didnt get into Berkeley even though they had better overall stats and studied/worked a lot harder than the black people.
Also p.s. since I know some people are going to comment ‘ohh you dont know, those black students might of had really hard background/childhood or were poor so thats why they deserve it,’ but no. The people at my school are upper middle class. Basically we all lived in the same community and knew each other. Everyone is well-off and well-to-do.
People even discredit my hard working asian parents saying that we are the model minority and that we got where we are because we’re asian. But what they dont realize is, is that my family came from nothing. A LOT of asian families build themselves from the ground up and know that education is really the only thing that can propel us further in our lives. Thats why we focus so much on school and education. Because we dont take for granted the sacrifices our parent’s made when they left their home country and came to American in order to provide a better life for their children. Thats why when less hard working students undermine the system, it pisses us all off.
Maybe my sudden rant on affirmative action and race is because of all the recent news... but really, the black community always acts like they are the only victims and the only people who feel discriminated against, BUT NEWS FLASHH, ITS ALL RACIAL COMMUNITIES WHO ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST: ASIANS, HISPANICS, INDIANS, ETC.

Tell me why a black person has a higher chance of getting into an elite school like harvard, stanford, and berkeley while asians are discriminated against, EVEN THO THE ASIAN PERSON HAS BETTER STATS AND EXTRACURRICULARS. Affirmative action is basically institutionalized racism and it makes me so pissed.
Im a chinese asian american. My parents worked really hard and earn money and I study countless hours. And when I got accepted into Berkeley as a CS major, I was soo excited. I busted my ass off in hs and I got really good grades and had relevant extracurriculars and good essays. But I was only one of the few asians that got in. A lot of my asian friends didnt get into top schools, even though I knew some deserved it more than I did. But when I was talking to some of my black friends, they also got into Berkeley and other really elite schools (with the same major) even though they had lower gpas and practically no extracurriculars. Literally my asian friends didnt get into Berkeley even though they had better overall stats and studied/worked a lot harder than the black people.
Also p.s. since I know some people are going to comment ‘ohh you dont know, those black students might of had really hard background/childhood or were poor so thats why they deserve it,’ but no. The people at my school are upper middle class. Basically we all lived in the same community and knew each other. Everyone is well-off and well-to-do.
People even discredit my hard working asian parents saying that we are the model minority and that we got where we are because we’re asian. But what they dont realize is, is that my family came from nothing. A LOT of asian families build themselves from the ground up and know that education is really the only thing that can propel us further in our lives. Thats why we focus so much on school and education. Because we dont take for granted the sacrifices our parent’s made when they left their home country and came to American in order to provide a better life for their children. Thats why when less hard working students undermine the system, it pisses us all off.
Maybe my sudden rant on affirmative action and race is because of all the recent news... but really, the black community always acts like they are the only victims and the only people who feel discriminated against, BUT NEWS FLASHH, ITS ALL RACIAL COMMUNITIES WHO ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST: ASIANS, HISPANICS, INDIANS, ETC. We all face different types of racial discriminations. I know soo many black people who really think that ‘they cant be racist because theyre black’🙄 what a load of bullshit.

2721144991495255,"6648. Koreans believe in this idea of a 첫사랑 or “first love,” an idea my grounded, realist brain could never wrap my head around. 첫사랑 calls back to the very first moments you caught a glimpse of love: the first time you fell head-over-heels for someone; the first time you would go 10 miles out of your way to make them happy; maybe the first time you really believed in the idea of real love, the essence of Korean dramas, Western rom-coms, and fairy tales
I could never believe in that idealistic love - I’m on a campus of over 30,000 people; in a city of close to a million; an individual in a world of 7.8 billion. Love was just a numbers game, a simple act of finding any one of your potential compatible partners.
But then I met “My One.” I didn’t realize it at the time. I thought she was just one of those countless compatible partners, someone I found with some luck. And I was lucky – those dinner time conversations we had about the small quirky things we did growing up and the same random thoughts we had throughout the week made me feel like someone in this world validated my existence, not by duty but by choice. There were even times where midway through my sentence she could finish it for me. And those few months were pure bliss and gave me hope in that textbook, idealistic love that everyone secretly yearns for.
Then came the heartbreak. It was never her fault. Love is all about timing as I’ve come to learn, and I had reveled in what we had for too long without pursuing what we could be. And it truly shattered my heart as she slipped my fingers, and I felt the type of pain that made the cheapest vodka go down as smoothly as water; a pain that taught me to keep my guard when it comes to matters of love and war; the pain that taught me that life is harrowingly unfair, and fate is just some fleeting, misguided belief we have to justify the unfortunate series of events that happen to us.
It’s almost a year now, and I’ve realized that she was and will always be my first love, my 첫사랑 – that one person who I would have stayed up until 4am talking to; that one person who could send me a text about her bad day and bring me out my classes to comfort her; that one person who I wanted to be nothing but happy. And as I move on, finding and building relationships with others within the boundaries of the pain and lessons I learned from her, part of me yearns: not for her but for that innocent, pure, unadulterated, and effortless love that I was fortunate and tortured to experience just once.","6648.

There is no compassion and understanding over the internet, and when you choose to be destructive in your words, you tear down those you are speaking for and harden the hearts of those who disagree with you.

Tbh I have a boyfriend and he’s white, and I care about him but he lacks the spice and culture and he’s just so flimsy and weak coupled up with just being too pampered and non manly. He’s just not rough around the edges or whatever at all! Like most Samoan men are fucking many and godly, like god damn what’s it like to be gods favorite.

The major requirements themselves are designed to that transfers can finish in two years, and the amount of upper divs majors can take is capped at two a semester because of how overcrowded the major is getting. In every single Political Science class I took for four years, on the first day of class without fail somebody would ask me if I was also a transfer. When I say no they immediately start getting insecure, one guy even said ""I heard they don't like transfers around here"". Like, what am I supposed to say to that? Some of my best friends in my other major were transfers, but the insecurity and sheer numbers in Political Science was on another level. I regularly overheard transfer students admit that they chose Political Science because it was the easiest and fastest way to transfer out of community college.
On the whole the major should be made more rigorous and quantitative. Political Science 3 is the most useful Political Science class and is no harder than a high school stats class, yet there were students who would go in and yell at the professor for ""ruining their lives"" with ""how hard"" the class was. I think Political Science should have a data science class requirement on top of Political Science 3. It would go a long way to improving the major, improving student outcomes, and attracting more talent to the major interested in serious analysis of domestic and global issues using the R programming language. Another minor thing, but it's absurd that Poli Sci majors who concentrate in IR don't have an additional foreign language requirement. Most reputable programs have this requirement and it boggles me that most of my classmates were not able to speak another language unless they were an international student or a heritage speaker. It's a major with so much potential that is neutered by the desire for risk adverse students to go to law school and end up hating their lives as lawyers.","6637.

Of course, I wasn't yet ready to accept that I might not be straight, even though deep down I knew it, so I explained all of these feelings in all the wrong ways. My nervousness? I was just insecure, because you're relatively -hot-I mean fit and I'm shorter and scrawny. Just good old-fashioned toxic masculinity, nothing more than that. Caring too much about what you think?

We did drift apart over time, but maybe that's for the best.

In high school, I took a bus full of black students. I went to my honors and AP classes filled with white jocks from rich families. Not one black person was in my classes. I was told by the white kids that if the black kids had tried harder and challenged themselves, they would be in these classes and not need affirmative action to get in.
In college, I would sit and do work in my undergrad dining hall. The students on work study were serving the regular students behind the glass barrier. The students eating outside were white. The students serving were black. I saw the white kids pouring salt on the floor, throwing food around, and leaving a mess of food and napkins after every service. I asked my friends at the close of service if they were okay with this and if they needed any help cleaning up. They said they got it.
I went to my middle school reunion. Some of my black friends did decently for themselves, while others became teen parents, drop outs, addicts. They told me they knew I would be successful because I was Asian and naturally smart. I wasn't as sure that was the reason.
I saw one of my other middle school friend at the DMV. He was once a straight A student, but because of some family situation, he failed out of high school and was trying to get through community college in hopes of transferring to a four-year college. He also had a beautiful name.
One of my students during my tutoring session kept falling asleep in class after an hour. I found out he was drinking soda before coming to my session to stay awake, and that his parents gave him money to spend for snacks. I told him that he should try quitting drinking soda and drink more water. He was too stressed out with school and with his home situation to listen.
I once asked my white friends why the police doesn't target crimes regarding drug use and an underage drinking at universities instead of low-income, predominantly black neighborhoods. They laughed.
One of the women at my GED tutoring program was a single mom with a daughter. She said she wanted to pass the GED to show her daughter that she can accomplish her goals if she put her mind to it. I never got to see her pass the GED.
I was hanging out with my friends outside when the police came to check us out. I saw my friends tense up and afraid. I quickly went up to the police and asked what was going on. They said someone reported a noise violation from some African Americans. I reassured the police that we were just hanging out and having fun. The police smiled, gently reminded us to keep the noise down, and left.
I would run into some dance friends of mine on the BART on my way back from work and chill with them. I would wear a nice shirt and dress pants; they would wear street clothes. When they leave the BART, the other passengers would often ask me if I knew those guys, as if it was such a strange thought that I could be friends with them. I would always say yes.

I was 12 years old when I told my mom that I wouldn't marry someone like my dad. I was too young to understand domestic abuse, let alone marriage, but even then I knew something was deeply wrong in our family. Domestic abuse has always been a part of my family. Yes, as time has passed it has decreased. The punches and screams occur rarely now, but then a trigger comes, and I'm reliving all of the fights I witnessed as a child. It really messes you up. However, what angers me most is the anger I hold. I'm angry at my dad for having a short fuse. But I'm also angry, at my mom. I'm angry that she chooses to intervene when my dad rages against my sibling ... in my mind, she's letting herself get hurt, even though as a mother, this is what she'll naturally want to do: protect her child. I'm angry that our culture prevents her from getting a divorce. A culture that prioritizes a family's image over one's personal wellbeing and happiness. I'm also angry at myself, that even though I was a child - maybe I should have done something. I was going to call the police once, but when I was going to I backed out because of the advice of a relative. I could have intervened more to protect my mom. However, keeping my distance and staying out of the fight was the way I learned to protect myself: physically and mentally. I'm in college now, and even though my sibling and I are getting ready to move on with our lives, our family is still so messed up. No matter how happy we try to be, the truth is my family can't operate together. Moreover, knowing this fact I am always wondering: do real happy families exist? Can I have a life with a loving partner, children based on mutual respect and kindness? Or am I somehow doomed to a family life like the one I was born to?","6633. CW: Abuse

A thousand promises you can never keep. And a thousand thousand little things that made me feel warm and cherished.
You said you never loved anyone. I said I never loved anyone. But I was prepared to love you. I was only a few chapters into our story, and I waited for love to spring up on me, knowing it was coming.
Looking back at all those sensations, even as some linger and others fade, is still beautiful. It feels like the last snow melting before spring. The last. Magical. All beauty and sensation. Clinging to bare stretches of rock as the sun turns it into a bitter slush, running thin, before it disappears into the growing grass. But it’s alright. My spring is before me and whether my choice or not, that is beautiful too.
I couldn’t have wished for more time. Or a better person to spend it with. It felt unregretful, simple, as natural as the turning of the season. Mine, a life slowly growing out of your touch. For you, I, only a day in the seasons of your life.
My heart hurts that in living your full, full life and I know you will never look back on us as I will.
But maybe one day still, I will be one of your orbits. That we will never, completely lose each other. That I will still laugh at your jokes and watch shows with you. One day I will meet your parents and the girl you introduce to them. I dream that I’ll burst into your apartment every year with your friends to wish you happy birthday. And my heart will no longer hurt but it will be full because even though you were snow before the beginning of spring, you were my last snow. And spring always remembers that with joy.","6630.

It’s not like anything is going wrong — I did well in my classes, stayed in touch with friends, and retained a summer internship I got — but I just wish I was truly passionate about something that’s doesn’t involve YouTube or video games. I thought that getting a hobby would help fill this gap, but nothing’s really worked so far, whether it be starting another programming project or trying to play the piano for fun.
Honestly, the only hobby that has really appealed to me is the furry fandom (I’ve lurked around it for a few years or so) but I’ve always been too scared to pursue it. I don’t think I would get along well with the majority of the online furry community (i.e. Twitter/Instagram), and I’m not really close with any furries irl. I also know my parents dislike furries due to the stereotypes that surround them, and I’ve been too scared to share these interests with my friends for the same reason. It probably doesn’t help that I get pretty anxious when interacting with others online (weirdly enough, in-person conversations are much more comfortable for me).
Although I enjoy consuming furry content (the cutesy stuff, not the porn), it would be nice to know someone that also shares the same interest as me. I don’t want to shove the fandom into other people’s faces; I simply want to interact with other furries and experience the community aspect of what the “fandom” actually is. I’ve tried to reach out a few times in the past, but I always psyched myself out and never committed to each attempt. I just wish I could muster up the confidence to try again and not let fear stop me from pursuing my interests.","6628. Ever since quarantine started, I’ve felt a large void appear in my life.

I don’t want to shove the fandom into other people’s faces; I simply want to interact with other furries and experience the community aspect of what the “fandom” actually is. I’ve tried to reach out a few times in the past, but I always psyched myself out and never committed to each attempt. I just wish I could muster up the confidence to try again and not let fear stop me from pursuing my interests.",,1594436433,,,11,14,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2719498188326602&id=2156420374634389,

Even the things I hated, I loved with you. That day when I went with you to the DMV? My favorite day of the semester, honest to god. You were the wittiest person I'd ever met, and I could listen to you speak all day. How could someone be so passionate? Your belief was so beautiful.
That day when you cried because your mom didn't understand you, and I sat with you all day? I had an interview the next day. I didn't care. I did poorly, but it didn't matter. You were more important. You were always more important.
I loved you. For every one of your quirks and wonders and flaws, I loved you.
You didn't love me. Not really. You loved the way I made you feel, the way I treated you, the way I talked to you, the way I cared for you.
You didn't understand that I struggled to express myself, that I'd always put family first, that academics mattered so much more to me than it did to you. You didn't understand that I couldn't afford weekend getaways or airbnbs next to the beach. You didn't understand that I worked 2 part-time jobs to put myself through college. You didn't understand why I had to hide you from my parents.
You loved the idea of me, but not the problems that came with me. I'm aware I'm not an easy person to love or to date. For that, I'm sorry, a million times over. I wish I could be the person you could love. But I'm not. I should be angry that you broke up with me, but I can't fault you. Your world is perfect, and I am not. I just hope you find someone who makes you as happy as you made me, who helps you see the world better, who pushes you to be better.

I used to think I was invincible to receiving rejections (I got accepted into the first two clubs I applied for) but ever since then everything else has been a hard no. It made me realize that I used to place such an importance on the positions I held when I was younger, but now I know that I was just using that as an excuse to feel better about myself and better than other people. Not surprisingly, most of my rejections have been from organizations that I admittedly applied to because I thought it would boost my resume (that wasn’t the ONLY reason but def a factor), but I recently got rejected from something I’m actually passionate about and that stung more than the others. I’ve kind of grown numb to these rejections at this point, and numb to the acceptances as well. How the fuck is that even possible??

2718663305076757,"6611. My boyfriend and I have been in a long term relationship (about 4 yrs now). We started dating in the beginning of our college years and we still cherish and love each other after all these years of ups and downs of our crazy college years. That being said, our relationship is not perfect at all. We've seen each other at our worst and it's affected our relationship immensely. We even broke up about two years ago and got back shortly after, which I know a lot of people feel very strongly against getting back with an ex, but oh well...
I think the breakup and getting back together has taken a big toll in our relationship and we're still learning to cope with it. Even after 2 years, I'm still blocked from all his social media and recently I found out he has a finsta from someone else, which I'm blocked from as well. We've both distanced each other from our friend groups and I still feel very uncomfortable hanging out with his friends; I'm someone who's always had a hard time forgiving and forgetting, and all the rumors his friends created about me, talking behind my back, and the hatred they had towards me is still hard to move on from. He never shares anything about his friends and I don't usually share much about my friends either and we don't text or talk as much as we used to, especially regarding other parts of our personal lives other, our beliefs, values, etc. (not trying to paint myself as a victim in any way; I also admit I was wrong in treating him in the past)
When we're together in person, we pretend like we're fine. He always tells me he loves me and treats me with so much care and love. But when I'm not with him, I can't help but feel lonely and isolated from his life. I obviously can't say I'm perfect when it comes to trying harder to mend our relationship, but it's just hard. As a result, I feel incompetent of communicating like a mature adult and I find myself doubting him and myself a lot. I don't know how to work through my feelings and our relationship...
I'm sorry this is such a long post. During this quarantine I've been spending most of my time alone in my apartment with very few people to talk to in-person, and these confusing and unsettling thoughts feel more intensified than ever and I felt the need to let it out.

Even after 2 years, I'm still blocked from all his social media and recently I found out he has a finsta from someone else, which I'm blocked from as well. We've both distanced each other from our friend groups and I still feel very uncomfortable hanging out with his friends; I'm someone who's always had a hard time forgiving and forgetting, and all the rumors his friends created about me, talking behind my back, and the hatred they had towards me is still hard to move on from. He never shares anything about his friends and I don't usually share much about my friends either and we don't text or talk as much as we used to, especially regarding other parts of our personal lives other, our beliefs, values, etc. (not trying to paint myself as a victim in any way; I also admit I was wrong in treating him in the past)
When we're together in person, we pretend like we're fine. He always tells me he loves me and treats me with so much care and love. But when I'm not with him, I can't help but feel lonely and isolated from his life. I obviously can't say I'm perfect when it comes to trying harder to mend our relationship, but it's just hard. As a result, I feel incompetent of communicating like a mature adult and I find myself doubting him and myself a lot. I don't know how to work through my feelings and our relationship...
I'm sorry this is such a long post. During this quarantine I've been spending most of my time alone in my apartment with very few people to talk to in-person, and these confusing and unsettling thoughts feel more intensified than ever and I felt the need to let it out.

Last summer, I got my first summer internship at a large company and my experience has pretty much already ruined . People seem to complain about Berkeley students being arrogant and rude, but the other intern at my workplace was a UC Irvine student who would constantly try to one-up me or put me down. Examples of how he would try to provoke me: He would talk about UC Berkeley not being ranked anymore in US news and how UCI was the Number 2 public university. I would tell him that I was attending a hackathon in my free time and he would cut in and say he won a hackathon because he ""grinded"" so hard. I would be talking about classes at my school with an alumni from my school and he would interrupt to talk about how hard his classes were. I put that I do some tutoring for data structures on my LinkedIn and he would boast about his own knowledge around me. Whenever I would talk to my mentor, he would always barge into the conversation and give unsolicited advice (I asked another coworker about the advice he gave and he told me the other intern was just talking shit). I feel like he was trying to drag me down for just going to a ""better"" school, even though I technically had less experience programming than him. I grey-rocked him for a while, but he really wore me down by the end of my internship. Also, one of my male coworkers would not stop harassing me. He would follow me around, hug me from behind, and constantly bring up sexual topics and jokes. I'm a girl and I've never witnessed him be this physical around anyone else. I told him his behavior was scary and unprofessional, but he kept doing it. No one even stopped him. In fact, one of the coworkers kept setting me up for dates with him (we would arrange to go out to eat together in a group, they would bail, and I would be stuck with him alone). I was too scared about being on everyone's good side to ever talk to HR, but considering he told me that he never received an HR complaint, I'm bitterly assuming it wouldn't have worked anyways. Outside of my internship, I went to a hackathon last summer and a bootcamp student laughed in my face for just asking him a question about React.js. He told me he would give a lot to get a degree from Berkeley and it made me incredibly embarrassed, like me not knowing enough was soiling my school name. Anyways, tldr is that I feel ashamed for being my gender and being a CS student at this student. I even omitted my school name from my final internship presentation because everything just got to me and lowered my self-esteem. Anyways, this is just a stupid rant. I get so fucking tired from even thinking about about this shit. I've graduated this semester with a full-time offer lined up, but all I have is a sense of dread from having to potentially deal with this all over again.","6606.

I was really grateful to see them again after so long and hang out but the surprise I had allowed myself to expect never happened. No one said happy birthday or anything to indicate they knew it was my birthday. (I sat in the back, paid for myself, got my own doors and chairs, paid for parking for all of us.

I saw one of them checking Instagram on the drive home and saw the happy birthday ig stories I had reposted to say thank you. As I was getting out, she said bye and happy birthday. The other friend said it quickly after but wasn’t able to hide the surprise. I don’t talk to them anymore. No one acknowledged the fact that they’d made plans w me the whole day on my birthday and didn’t realize until I was being dropped off.

I cannot say such a location wasnt ideal for some folk but I preferred the other side.
Where you could see the crepescular light flittering between the Redwoods.
Where the babble of the creek and the wind in the reeds lay a melody to accompany the lyrics of the passing students.
Where I once watched crawfish marching against the current only to be overturned upon reaching the precipice of one particularly prominent cascade, and starting over.
They disappeared one day. Upon voicing my concern and dispair of the loss of my beshelled bretheren an intellectual associate of the university assured me of their immenent return.
Unfortunately I will be unavailable to witness it.
It was not particularly easy to get to, this retaining wall of stone and cement, a rocky outcrop overlooking the vast canyon full of life. The bugs catch the last rays of sun, swirling clouds of gold.
They entrance my curiosity, but slightly remind me of Michael Crichton's book, Prey.
I would sit there eating my last snack and a kombucha from the food collective that accepts EBT. I would sit and think for a pause, a breath for myself before whatever evening class or activity I've overloaded myself with this time.
I would find peace in those moments.
True there were a lot of tears, a lot of grey hairs, but now that I will no longer be returning to this campus it only exists in my memory.
It exists in my memory as: Me,
Sitting on a stone wall underneath the first stars revealed amidst waning gold of the sun.
Listing to the wind and water, feeling the cool dusk breeze, smelling the trees and wet earth.

I did a quick check on my social media and I realized I met him on Tinder couple days ago, but I had no clue about who he was and had no memory of talking to him. We have couple of drinks and I try to pass time before finding an excuse to send him away but he just would not leave.

I told her I could read and speak Chinese when my banana ABC self actually can't (esp not traditional) since she doesn't know much English and I've been using Google translate to decipher the text. The thing is she's recently been starting to send voice messages and her mandarin is accented so Google translate doesn't translate it completely right and that's led to some awkward conversations. I've even asked my parents on some of the stuff said (they were actually happy to help since they always wanted me to date someone from China/Taiwan) but if she starts talking about sexual stuff then its gonna be even more awkward.

2716171388659282,"6587. Hot take. (I'm a man) Men and women often say a guy should be direct, especially being direct with his intentions, when flirting with a girl, but this is kind of BS.
You can say you're ""looking for a relationship"", or you're ""not looking for a relationship"", or you ""want something casual"", etc. But if you want a one-night stand, but you don't want to go on dates, you need to go to a bar and flirt and hope you get laid or go on dating apps. That's because you can't just tell a woman ""I don't want to date you or have a relationship, I just want to fuck you for one night"" (you may say this sounds sleazy, but why? I thought we are allowed to be comfortable in our sexual desires, including men, including one night stands). That'd be super inappropriate and rude, wouldn't it? You can say ""I'm looking for something casual"". You can keep it light and flirty, and meet up for drinks, and there's a decent chance a one night stand may happen, you just can't say it. But the most direct way to say it may get you slapped and will definitely have your friends wondering what's wrong with you.
Even with compliments, the ""be direct"" advice is bullshit. Maybe you're flirting because someone is cute, or hot. So when you chat her up, you can tell her she's cute, that may even be your opener (has worked for me). But you can't tell her she's ""hot"" or ""sexy"" (not even when chatting her up, let alone as an opener) because, again, that just seems inappropriate at best, and objectifying and sexist and cat-calling-esque at worst.

2715275988748822,"6579. CW: abusive relationship, suicide, sexual assault
Am I a terrible person?
I graduated as my high school valedictorian and left for Berkeley, my dream school.
I left my high school boyfriend of 4 years for my freshman fresh start.
But extremely low self-esteem plus sexual frustration left me thirstyyyyy affffff, so I start dating a guy I met on tinder. For the next two years at Cal 2018-2019, I spend every night with tinder guy and become deeply in love.
At first, our relationship was fun and adventurous at first, I would see his band, we’d walk around SF, we smoke and do drugs— all the fun things!
I introduced him to my family, but he inevitably starts to hate them and tries convincing me to cut them off.
Then summer of 2019, after a super intense trip, I tell all my childhood close friends that I can no longer be friends with them (Cutting them off)— my boyfriend supporting my decision. But my parents flip, become angry and worried about me. My tinder boyfriend convinced me that my parents wanted to control me and were stalling my progress in my passions. My parents reach out to my boyfriend because of their concern about me cutting off my friends, he calls my dad a fat loser and cussed out my mom in text. My tinder boyfriend says I have to choose between him or my parents...So I cut off my parents.
July 2019: I begin crying everyday, gaining an eating disorder, and feel a deep pain between my parents and I. I apply for fafsa independence and earn it. I get my own credit cards and change all my banking information— completely cutting my funding from them and I begin to work three jobs while taking classes.
In my independence appeal, I mentioned that my dad would inappropriately touch me—- and I’ve had trouble with asserting my boundaries with him, but I think I created a false impression that he was a child molester (WHICH HE IS ABSOLUTELY NOT)
My younger 16yr old sister reached out to me asking if I’m okay— but I tell her she isn’t worth my effort — and I begin to confide in one of her friends.
My tinder boyfriend tries to convince me to not talk to my family— and I send them a letter saying that I don’t love them— but the pain of hurting them and all my friends begins plaguing my mental health.
To cope, I turned to doing more drugs with my boyfriend. I made art about my anger at my mom and post it all over social media.
September 2019: My sister’s best friend kills themselves— so I reach out to her because that’s much bigger than any petty shit I have to complain about.
I finally call my parents after not speaking with them for 2 months. I needed to mend the pain I felt towards them and our relationship.
Sept 2019: My dad finds out about my saying that he inappropriately touched me and he feels betrayed. My parents say that I called my dad a molester when I deliberately didn’t use those words. My parents are traumatized by my hateful letter.
During all this, I continue to be called into the Dean of Students office because my parents won’t stop calling them about being worried about me and my relationship.
They also repeatedly call everyone in my boyfriends family to figure out what happened.
October 2019: realize my parents had been reading all my texts between my boyfriend and I for the past few months. My parents sent screen shots of our (my boyfriend and my texts) texts to the Dean of Students Office.
I tell my tinder boyfriend about what my parents did and he breaks up with me— because I still want my parents in my life
I freak out and practically beg him to take me back— because I feel I lost everything.
I swear to my boyfriend that I’ll never mention my parents and that they’ll never communicate with him again.
Dec 2019: I apply for study abroad— but get flagged by a doctor that I am not in a mentally stable place to study abroad.
I appeal and my parents get everyone they know to write letters to send me on my program.
I am accepted into the program and leave in January 2020.
I bring tabs with me on my program and take 5 + tabs within 2 weeks—- I get sexually assaulted while tripping and off alone— and have a psychotic break while at the airport with some of my travel buddies in the program. I treat my travel buddies like shit and almost get arrested due to my psychotic behavior.
Feb 2020: I am flown to Bangkok and stay in a psych ward for three weeks.
My dad— travels to Bangkok and stays by my side— takes me back to Cali
March 2019:
I am back in Cali— out of my study abroad program with my family.
I tell them my psychotic break wasn’t from drugs (it was) —I tell them I am no longer with my boyfriend (THEY LOATHE MY BOYFRIEND and I have been texting him the entire time)
March 2019: My parents find out I am still talking to him and my dad calls his dad to tell him to stay away from me and my family.
I stop talking to him... coronavirus happens and my study abroad programs gets cancelled anyways.
May 2019: 2 months go by and I feel miserable— all I want to do is talk to my now ex tinder boyfriend.
I finally talk to him again after crying— I had no plan for the call — I was suprised he answered.
He answers my call and says he felt betrayed because I didn’t talk to him during rona— plus we already broke up before I begged and promised things would be different. He says he’s better off without me and doesn’t want to talk to me.
This makes me want to talk to him more— so. I send him drugs in the mail for his birthday—- I know he’s alone and I want to be there for him. My parents hate that I still want to talk to this guy at all.
I told my sister that I had a psychotic break because of acid and she tells me parents.
Now my mom feels even more betrayed because of my constant lying.
Now I have no boyfriend who was my sole friend (I became codependent).","6579. CW: abusive relationship, suicide, sexual assault

Then summer of 2019, after a super intense trip, I tell all my childhood close friends that I can no longer be friends with them (Cutting them off)— my boyfriend supporting my decision. But my parents flip, become angry and worried about me. My tinder boyfriend convinced me that my parents wanted to control me and were stalling my progress in my passions. My parents reach out to my boyfriend because of their concern about me cutting off my friends, he calls my dad a fat loser and cussed out my mom in text. My tinder boyfriend says I have to choose between him or my parents...So I cut off my parents.
July 2019: I begin crying everyday, gaining an eating disorder, and feel a deep pain between my parents and I. I apply for fafsa independence and earn it. I get my own credit cards and change all my banking information— completely cutting my funding from them and I begin to work three jobs while taking classes.
In my independence appeal, I mentioned that my dad would inappropriately touch me—- and I’ve had trouble with asserting my boundaries with him, but I think I created a false impression that he was a child molester (WHICH HE IS ABSOLUTELY NOT)
My younger 16yr old sister reached out to me asking if I’m okay— but I tell her she isn’t worth my effort — and I begin to confide in one of her friends.
My tinder boyfriend tries to convince me to not talk to my family— and I send them a letter saying that I don’t love them— but the pain of hurting them and all my friends begins plaguing my mental health.
To cope, I turned to doing more drugs with my boyfriend. I made art about my anger at my mom and post it all over social media.
September 2019: My sister’s best friend kills themselves— so I reach out to her because that’s much bigger than any petty shit I have to complain about.
I finally call my parents after not speaking with them for 2 months. I needed to mend the pain I felt towards them and our relationship.
Sept 2019: My dad finds out about my saying that he inappropriately touched me and he feels betrayed. My parents say that I called my dad a molester when I deliberately didn’t use those words. My parents are traumatized by my hateful letter.
During all this, I continue to be called into the Dean of Students office because my parents won’t stop calling them about being worried about me and my relationship.
They also repeatedly call everyone in my boyfriends family to figure out what happened.
October 2019: realize my parents had been reading all my texts between my boyfriend and I for the past few months. My parents sent screen shots of our (my boyfriend and my texts) texts to the Dean of Students Office.
I tell my tinder boyfriend about what my parents did and he breaks up with me— because I still want my parents in my life
I freak out and practically beg him to take me back— because I feel I lost everything.
I swear to my boyfriend that I’ll never mention my parents and that they’ll never communicate with him again.
Dec 2019: I apply for study abroad— but get flagged by a doctor that I am not in a mentally stable place to study abroad.
I appeal and my parents get everyone they know to write letters to send me on my program.
I am accepted into the program and leave in January 2020.
I bring tabs with me on my program and take 5 + tabs within 2 weeks—- I get sexually assaulted while tripping and off alone— and have a psychotic break while at the airport with some of my travel buddies in the program. I treat my travel buddies like shit and almost get arrested due to my psychotic behavior.
Feb 2020: I am flown to Bangkok and stay in a psych ward for three weeks.
My dad— travels to Bangkok and stays by my side— takes me back to Cali
March 2019:
I am back in Cali— out of my study abroad program with my family.
I tell them my psychotic break wasn’t from drugs (it was) —I tell them I am no longer with my boyfriend (THEY LOATHE MY BOYFRIEND and I have been texting him the entire time)
March 2019: My parents find out I am still talking to him and my dad calls his dad to tell him to stay away from me and my family.
I stop talking to him... coronavirus happens and my study abroad programs gets cancelled anyways.
May 2019: 2 months go by and I feel miserable— all I want to do is talk to my now ex tinder boyfriend.
I finally talk to him again after crying— I had no plan for the call — I was suprised he answered.
He answers my call and says he felt betrayed because I didn’t talk to him during rona— plus we already broke up before I begged and promised things would be different. He says he’s better off without me and doesn’t want to talk to me.
This makes me want to talk to him more— so. I send him drugs in the mail for his birthday—- I know he’s alone and I want to be there for him. My parents hate that I still want to talk to this guy at all.
I told my sister that I had a psychotic break because of acid and she tells me parents.
Now my mom feels even more betrayed because of my constant lying.
Now I have no boyfriend who was my sole friend (I became codependent).",,1594009809,,,13,18,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2715275988748822&id=2156420374634389,

2715273705415717,"6574. I love my sister, but I can't stand her recent behavior patterns. This girl isn't social distancing, and she fucks literally every single guy she meets. I'm all for casual sex (esp when there's NOT a pandemic going on), but the problem is that she doesn't care about boundaries or trust, so she ends up hurting SO MANY people by doing this. And then she comes to me whining about how she feels like a ""slut"" but it's not her fault because she's so horny in quarantine. And every time I say ANYTHING (literally just agreeing with her that she didn't make the ideal choices, or suggesting that she apologize to the people she hurt), she lashes out and says I'm too judgmental. So I guess I'll vent my actual judgments here.
1. She's not even quarantining herself, and she's endangering everyone in our household by being the ONLY person who doesn't give a fuck about the virus. I haven't seen any of my friends for months, which has been really hard on my mental health, but I'm not about to be selfish and put more lives at risk. It gives me more anxiety to know she's out and about 24/7, hanging out with people she doesn't know or like just because they give her alcohol.
2. Most people are horny, dude. She acts like it's impossible to control herself, but the fact is that she doesn't care enough to learn any discipline.
3. If her friend specifically asks her not to sleep with someone bc they're an ex or current hookup (or even a current partner, jesus), she should fucking respect that. She'd rather fuck someone she isn't even into, and then lie about it, because again -- no discipline. And then she wonders why her friendships never last longer than a few months.
4. She's also drunk for 95% of these encounters, but she won't listen to me about consent because... it's inconvenient??
Basically she calls herself a terrible person and spirals into self-hatred, and then I have to talk her down, and then she repeats the cycle all over again. I love my sister more than anything or anyone, but quarantine has made me realize that she's not a good person. These problems are largely self-created. She's put me through a LOT during the past months (this stuff doesn't even scratch the surface), and I've sacrificed my own mental health to be kind and understanding for her, but she acts like she's the only one going through a hard time, so that justifies her actions.

I saw her in my dreams again last night,
As we cuddled, reading, by firelight.
A blanket ‘round us, the stars above us,
And an endless future that lay before us.
We laughed, we smiled, we hugged, we kissed,
She’s the one I’ll always miss.
In loose white hoody, like angel in gown,
Just the sight of her banishes frown.
To love and to hold, together grow old,
Would be my fondest, lasting wish.
But in the shadows, a creeping doubt,
Of how our reality will play out.
What am I saying? I’m lost in delusion,
Reminiscing of things that are less than illusion.
To fool my heart, which has grown weary,
I imagine a life existing only in theory.
So follow your calling, follow your heart,
I’m happy if you’re happy, even apart.
Because you don’t love me, and never will,
And to this end, myself I’ll kill.
An eternal agony, hellfire and brimstone,
I’d endure any, for her to be my own.
But if I cannot love her I cannot live,
There’s only so much my heart can give.
So until she loves me, a moment sublime,
Or until my will fails the test of time,
I’ll keep dreaming of her
Alone at night.

Sex got boring because we would have it all the time but now I’m fantasizing about it more since we can’t have it. I’m really happy I like him this much, but I also feel like once quarantine ends I’ll slowly start resenting him again for wanting to be in my life 24/7 and I’ll probably want to break up with him once we’re allowed to see each other in person.

I'm not like the crazy rich Asian level fob, but I AM an international student paying that 62K tuition.

I'm trying to have nice things."" While I'm not opposed to buying close friends gifts and I like to think of myself as a good gift giver, I think it's uncomfortable that most international students get the tagline of ""rich"" because we are affording the thicc tuition. Being rich at Berkeley where we joke about being communist all the time means that a lot of people expect us to spend all of our money on others. And again, I have no problem buying my friends food or boba from time to time and giving gifts on special holidays and birthdays like it is conventional, but outside of *conventional* expectations of how social interactions and money spending work, we are expected to spend even more just because we had more to begin with. However, I'd like to remind everyone that most of the rich fobs' money comes from their parents' pockets and most of us are very grateful to them for giving us this opportunity to study abroad (comfortably) at a prestigious university, etc. and don't really intend on wasting our money on people/things we don't find as important or necessary. Maybe this is just me, but I don't feel that it's ok that people just EXPECT me to pay for their things (whether it be food, boba, gifts, etc.), just because I'm from a different country.
Going back to my original statement, I can understand why rich people end up hanging out with rich people because they probably don't have this extra pressure to be spending money on people and things they really don't want to spend on. They also don't have to propose hang out plans while taking into account the financial situation of other people. Sometimes I don't like asking people to go out because I feel like they're going to expect me to pay for them. I like spending money on close people and I willingly pay for food on dates, but please, you are NOT entitled to my money.

2713681228908298,"6559. CW: anti-feminism
I’ve seen a lot of posts recently that begin with “men are trash” so I’m going to throw my opinions in the mix. Don’t comment some passive aggressive shit for likes. If you’re gonna reply, make it count and make it real.
People can’t figure shit out because our world has a lot of different specifics in it and things are different from place to place. I do not see any more need for feminism in the world I live in, which is white upper middle class suburbia. We still need to fight for women’s rights in most places in the world, and in most minds as well, and in places with entrenched (old) male power. But 20 somethings in Berkeley? No. What we need is Meninism.
Why? Masculinity—again, in the world I live in—is in shambles. It’s not enough to say it’s a crisis. It is held up by your father’s failed ambitions and thin air. Women have taken ground that was theirs by due and then some. We’re at fourth wave feminism now. Again, white upper middle class is here and, like, Canada and the internet, not fucking Nigeria or Mobile or your racist Indian mom’s brain. Women have special clubs where they all get together and succeed. They have music and movies and a friendship culture conducive to modern life. They call any man who hurt them toxic and leave with ‘thank u, bye,’ and actually love the feminine aspects of themselves. In short, they remade the attributes of femininity to fucking work for this day and age. The old feminism was about suffrage and autonomy and owning property. 2020 women have the discourse on their side and they’re succeeding in spite of and to spite the other sex.
Meninism, as I see it, is not a project to fight for equality between the sexes, but rather one to remake masculinity to be something useful for us today. That is, obviously males do not need to fight for suffrage or positions of power, but they DO need to deal with a world where they don’t have power and are getting constantly fucked over.
I don’t know anyone who is secure in their masculinity. I know a lot of angry, fucked up people who think the world doesn’t give a shit about them. Concerned with power and control and constantly reminded that they have none. I don’t know any men who associate masculinity and self love. There aren’t many people I know who actually love themselves, but the ones I do fall into one of three categories: religious people, those with a wonderful upbringing and family, and successful women. They aren’t comfortable talking about their problems and aren’t as likely to see hope.
The economy is tanking. Competition for jobs is higher than ever. Social mobility is down. Religiosity is declining. Mainstream society is still Avengers but the zeitgeist is Moonlight. But Moonlight was just a critique. Where’s a positive expression of something new, something better?
Meanwhile, women say shit like ‘men are trash’ and you feel this sinking feeling in your belly that you can’t stand up and say anything because you’re gonna get shot down and no one will sit still long enough to get past that part of complexity about things being different in white upper middle class suburbia and sexist hicks. This sinking feeling permeates ALL of progressive discourse, which is to say the whole of the mainstream internet, and is damn near powerless to sliding towards the left extreme, so if you want to find an opinion that is even visible from your starting mindset, you need to go to conservative safe spaces. And god forbid someone says women are doing fine. Your worldview is you vs. the Man and you vs. the Men. Is it thinkable to you that maybe you aren’t oppressed? How much of your self is based on the assumption that you’re part of an oppressed group? Again, I’m not talking about Nigeria or your grandpa.
Mainstream masculinity doesn’t fit with reality because we don’t GET to fight things out or control our lives or be a breadwinner. The arc of culture points out the shitty parts of masculinity yet dominates discourse to a point where men repress ourselves and can’t work out a solution.
You’re probably thinking right now: “You’re just describing toxic masculinity! Don’t worry, there’s an easy fix.” No, the whole thing needs to be remade. Stoicism? Out. Control? Out. Sexual prowess? Out.

-Acceptance of being out of control, solution to value 1. Witty Robin Hood-esque tricksters who can effect change through cunning and manipulation, 2. Articulate speakers who convince those to their point of view through skillful argumentation yet, crucially, who do so with style, offense (tactful offensiveness is valued), and an expectation of being at least a little wrong, 3. Great passion manifested as political expression, 4. Redirect social status from being rich (compensated) to being masterfully skilled in rewarding and tricky pursuits, less focus on practical and more focus on skillful
-Total rejection of emotional repression, solution to value 1. Intense, rapid, frenetic emotion and its artistic, stylistic expression, 2. A new emphasis on brotherhood that promotes both deep, serious connection to best male friends as well as a political consciousness as a ‘brotherhood of men’ 3. Not so much of an emphasis on introspection or talking about emotions so much as feeling them intensely and being skillful at translating abstract emotions into concrete words and ideas
-Relationship to women as political equals, misty-eyed, deeply sexual, occasionally deceitful, overly talkative, and patient: 1. Recreate sexual relationships as less impactful and more cognizant of both parties being lustful 2. Excision of control and dominance obsession in favor of the realization that there are significant fractions of submissive women and dominant women and, moreover, that there is something to be gained from both (value experimentation, switch sexuality, and sexual playfulness over sexual dominance and prowess), 3. New narrative of competition with women (especially in the job market) which presumes the equality of women but also reinforces men’s positions as positively contrasted with and in a heroically worthy competition, 4. Dampens idealism of female or overly-progressive discourse with vocal, jocular, combative, and shrewd responses that is, unlike my previous point, not based in a male vs female framework but rather the values of idealism and realism (with the assumption that men tend towards realism and women towards idealism)
-Relationship to the self characterized by lust for life, paradoxically taking both unassailable worthiness of the self and an essentially flawed nature of men and of humanity (ie pride and self-deprecation), political consciousness where the self is lowly yet unified (not a millionaire-in-waiting), taken seriously yet in need of tempering in the fires of strife and experimentation.
We need a new generation of Jim Edgertons, of Tyler Durdens, of drunken poets and bad dancers, of first-rate cashiers and martial artists and laborers who hack through their repression and oppression with a meat cleaver.
My world DOESN’T need more feminism. Sure, we need more feminists to spread that business far and wide. But that’s there and we need to make a change here and now.
These godforsaken emasculated men are shit. They’re bad citizens, bad sons, bad fathers. I want to be clear that society writ large is complete shit, too, and that needs to change as well. So that’s a parallel transformation that we need to work on. Right now, though, masculinity needs to be destroyed and rebuilt from the ground up.

I think I’ve finally found my soulmate. And I really believe he is the one. He gives me butterflies and makes me warm inside, it’s the best feeling I’ve ever experienced. I don’t really know what love is, but I really think this is it.
I’m just scared because I might end up losing him one day or that he decides to leave me. I know it’s excessive and irrational worrying, but I honestly don’t know what to do without him. He makes my life complete and whole, and I feel like a better person because of him.
He’s made me love myself, he’s actually saved me. But the thought of him going away is what makes me try harder everyday. I’m nice than I was before, kinder, trying to be funnier, all the reasons to impress him and hope to keep his attention. I don’t want to lose whatever he sees in me. I don’t want him to see how I see myself.

2713679492241805,"6556. CW: rape
I have seen multiple confessions on this confessions page victim-blaming and slut-shaming women who have been sexually assaulted. These attacks are often ‘justified’ by the 'promiscuous clothing' the victims wore. Seeing these posts has made me incredibly disappointed in the people writing these confessions and the people liking them (some of which are my friends).
When I was 14 I met an older guy who went to my school that I ended up liking. A shared friend of ours told me that he wanted to hang out with me more and gave me his number. We talked for a while and we were planning on smoking weed together (my first time) and I suggested going to a park. He was insistent on going to my house, and eventually, I said okay. I was just so desperate for him to like me. I accidentally fell asleep and woke up to sixteen missed calls from him, but he angrily agreed to still meet. When he got to my house, he claimed that he already smoked an entire joint and told me to smoke the one he handed me. I had never gotten high before and trusted him when I smoked the entire thing. I had stolen some of my parent's liquor and I had my very first sip of alcohol. It was disgusting and I told him that I didn't want to have anymore but he kept egging me on. I don't recall how much I had, but I don't remember him having any. I heard my dad wake up and told him to leave and he did. I was completely crossed and remember flashes of him asking if he should come back and me saying yes. The next thing I remember is he and I making out and it tasting like a fucking microwave burrito. After that, all I remember is A LOT of pain *down there* and then him leaving when he accidentally turned a light on.
He told all of his friends and random people that I didn't know that we had had sex.
My parents eventually found out and blamed me for it. I know I shouldn't have invited a boy over when they didn't know, but the slut-shaming didn't cease for several months. I started wearing more revealing clothes as a way to try to change who I was. Since coming to Berkeley, I've had my FAIR share of hookups and my friends, the guys especially, have repeatedly teased me about this. I always thought that this school was an accepting place, and while I love a lot of the people I've met here, those comments really hurt. Those same friends like posts similar to the ones I mentioned above.
To this day, I physically can't have penetrative sex and I can't help but feel broken, especially when I tell the guys that and see the reaction on their faces when they expect more. I'm not sure if it has to do with that night, but I just wanted to say it sucks. It sucks that assault still happens and it sucks that women have to deal with derogatory comments and it sucks that people are more focused on ""what she was wearing."" I'm just tired.
While being in a support group has helped me process the incident, I’d be lying if I said I’ve completely processed it. Part of me still blames myself and believes I should have known better. Between what that boy told everyone in school, my parent’s values, and the posts that I mentioned, I can't help but feel disgusted.","6556. CW: rape

2712865538989867,"6548. I’m seeing a lot of transfer hate. So let me just EDUCATE your privileged 4-year selves:
One thing most regular students don’t understand about transfers: the resiliency of being a transfer. The percentage of students who just go to community college for two years and run over to Cal is small.
Transfers are also parents, veterans, previously incarcerated, and returning students, many more populations that don’t have it easy by any means. The rest of us for the most part have had to take 6 years to get our BA (on average) because the community college system actively works against us (it’s changing but barely started changing).
We are not only the students who wanted a “cheaper option” we are the students that could not afford college the first time around, had to stay home for one reason or the other, and more. I went through community college working 2 jobs and still couldn’t afford my bills because I was caring for my family as well, I tried to make it out in 2 years but because of the structures set up against us I was unable to and stayed for 3. I know many of us who didn’t do well in high school because we were disadvantaged by underresourced schools and community colleges are far more funded to where they have things like tutoring.
The students who assume it’s easy because they take one class are ridiculous. 1. Not every class is equal, you should know that. 2. Berkeley is known as being significantly more difficult than even some Ivies because of grade deflation, at any CSU and at most UC’s you might think those classes are easy too. You grew into harder professors but the world isn’t like that. Many students in other schools have experienced the opposite, that community college classes expect MORE from you because they are trying to train everyone to be ready for their new school to transfer to. My main geography professor had the same class at two schools- one CSU and our CCC. She actively made ours harder to train our minds to handle anything.
Also, the fact that you’re calling my 87 units of straight A’s not worthy of being here? I earned that. I absolutely deserve to be here. Not because of some quota (which, by the way, gives this school it’s only amount of diversity, think about that one) but because I earned it. I have done so much more in terms of professional development than most of the regular juniors here who think they’re better than me because I’m a transfer. Why? I had to take advantage of EVERY opportunity to get here.
Also another note: you obviously have no idea how disadvantaged we are here. Only having two years for all these resources, not qualifying for most scholarships and programs (because we don’t have any Berkeley connections). People are also not open to transfers joining a lot of clubs and it’s so much more difficult to do things like get into ASUC (look at the last cycle). its historically true that the first semester at Cal is the worst GPA meaning that any lower grade we get as we are thrust into this school will weigh us all the way down. Our mistakes are weighed more than yours. We have to be flawless upon coming in if we want anything from this campus.
The reason why we don’t have representation on anything and why no one helps us or advocates for us is because students who are here all 4 years love to think they know us and get us but you don’t.
Btw ask any professor, they love us. We statistically do better than you 4-year’s in every class and on every level. Sounds like jealousy to me💁🏽‍♀️","6548. I’m seeing a lot of transfer hate. So let me just EDUCATE your privileged 4-year selves:

But I feel that this has all taught me one very important lesson. True love isn’t about how you feel about someone. It doesn’t matter about how much love you have for someone. It’s whether or not the love you have for someone is matched equally by the love they have for you. Why do I pine after someone that clearly doesn’t love me as much as I love them, that doesn’t appreciate my presence, that doesn’t remember any of the love I gave, but just our unhappy moments. Why do I need to love someone that finds every reason to leave, when I can find that person that will find that one small reason to stay. It sucks being in quarantine honestly, cause i don’t have anything to distract myself with. I just think of her, over and over and over, how I could’ve been better, and so on. But as time has gone on I realize I did more than enough. I loved her more than I loved myself. I should’ve loved myself. I should’ve prioritized myself. I should have been more selfish too. Why was it that when she was unhappy, or caught up on her exes, it was fine to rip into me, compare, and drop our relationship like it was nothing. But when I was unhappy I told myself that she would change, that she would eventually realize what she did. I wish I could stop thinking of her. Stop remembering the good memories and only hold onto the bad moments just like her. I wish I could move on. I know she has. Love was honestly the best thing in the world while it lasted.

It’s whether or not the love you have for someone is matched equally by the love they have for you. Why do I pine after someone that clearly doesn’t love me as much as I love them, that doesn’t appreciate my presence, that doesn’t remember any of the love I gave, but just our unhappy moments. Why do I need to love someone that finds every reason to leave, when I can find that person that will find that one small reason to stay. It sucks being in quarantine honestly, cause i don’t have anything to distract myself with. I just think of her, over and over and over, how I could’ve been better, and so on. But as time has gone on I realize I did more than enough. I loved her more than I loved myself. I should’ve loved myself. I should’ve prioritized myself. I should have been more selfish too. Why was it that when she was unhappy, or caught up on her exes, it was fine to rip into me, compare, and drop our relationship like it was nothing. But when I was unhappy I told myself that she would change, that she would eventually realize what she did. I wish I could stop thinking of her. Stop remembering the good memories and only hold onto the bad moments just like her. I wish I could move on. I know she has. Love was honestly the best thing in the world while it lasted. But now, it’s done nothing but ripped me to shreds.",,1593734456,,,10,0,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2712864508989970&id=2156420374634389,

I always thought American colleges had such a patriotic vibe to them, but then there I was at the Stanford game screaming and cheering my balls off. I also know nothing about football lol.
From my short time of being a bear, and coming from a completely different institutional experience, I must say the pride and the rush you feel being a student and being on campus is insane and incomparable. But I also feel like it passes a point where you feel like you're constantly having to keep up with everyone, the good grades, the internships, the clubs. To all bears now, I hope this quarantine is giving you a fresh break from the crazy side to Berkeley. At the same time, I also hope you know how lucky you all are. Love from Australia :-)","6545.

2711979045745183,"6539. I desperately need advice. I tend to overthink and make excuses for why I stay in relationships. My first year at Cal was hard. I had just gotten out of a 5 year relationship and I was heart broken. I put myself out there and by fate I met this incredible guy. He was completely opposite from my ex. He was also twice my age. This wasn’t a sugar daddy situation though.
At first I felt so lucky, he bought me flowers, took me on dates, and did everything I’ve truly ever wanted a man to do. He wasn’t immature and he makes a really good amount of money. He was kind and different.
Yet, maybe there’s a reason he doesn’t date people his age. I have since found out that he’s an alcoholic. I am not a big drinker, but maybe if I was I would be more understanding. Sometimes I just think the good out ways the bad. He does x,y, and z for me, should I really break up with him over this one thing. I keep making excuses for why it’s okay for him to drink excessively. But there’s no good reason for why we get into so many fights when he drinks. I feel terrible because he NEVER has asked me to change a thing, and when I tell him it makes me uncomfortable that he drinks so much. He says he doesn’t want to change, and that this is the reason we have less sex. He says because he feel judged he doesn’t really want to have sex with me. I feel very sexual deprived, and at times I think about leaving the relationship because I’m not getting what I need but I always talk my way out of it. I don’t want to pretend like I’m okay with his drinking when I’m not. It’s been a over a year since we started dating.... I moved back home from Berkeley and it’s still hard. I haven’t been in a LDR... I don’t see him drink all the time.
Honestly, I don’t think anyone is going to treat me as good, or my parents won’t like a guy as much as they like him. If I stay with him then I’ll definitely end up marrying him. But is he my be all end all? I don’t think I am strong enough to break up with him.... I hate feeling so weak. What should I do?","6539. I desperately need advice.

2711976249078796,"6532. So I’m scared I may be leading on my good friend without intending to. :-(
Some context: we’ve known each other for about a year and a half now. We met last year thru a study group and we’ve become very close friends, able to talk about all kinds of things ranging from... idk super serious existential crisis to stuff all the way to kinks/fetishes we’ve always wanted to try. Super open w/ each other.
Also worth saying he buys me stuff somewhat often. Like, we’ll go to cream and he’ll be like, “my treat!” and when I asked him about it, he says it’s just like... he recognizes his privilege cause his family is well off and so he likes to occasionally spoil his friends. Okay, fine. I’m poor as dirt, so if somebody wants to buy me ice cream or dinner occasionally, then I’m not stopping them.
Then this year, this January, he shot his shot. Said he realized over the xmas break that he had feelings for me cause of how much he missed me. And even though he is legit one of the sweetest people I’ve ever met, I’m just not into him that way. Besides, I’m young—I wanna explore and be a slut for a bit—I don’t want anything serious right now. So I told him no thanks and I hope we can still be friends.
And I know that hurt him a lot. It hurt to see him hold back tears (Dumb toxic masculinity), but we bounced back and we’re still good friends... except ever since, I feel weird about him buying me things. It feels wrong even though he had done it before. I feel strange talking to him about my sex life or who I’m crushing on, so I don’t. I feel myself pulling away, even though he’s done nothing wrong and has handled rejection so unbelievably well.
Today, I received a graduation present from him in the mail (Go Class of 2020!) and it’s easily a few hundred bucks. I am shocked. Like, I know you said your family was well off, but d a m n. Nobody’s ever spent that much on me before. And this is where the concern comes from.
I’m confident he understood that I’m not interested in him. I don’t think he’s trying to buy my affection, but I have to wonder... am I preventing him from moving on by accepting his gifts? Or am I overthinking it?
I know, I should just communicate. And I have. We are able to SAY we’re on the same page. But my GUT feels differently. My gut is starting to think I’m doing him harm by accepting his gifts. I’m afraid he’s still into me and the gifts are how he’s acting on it and I’m leading him on by accepting them and getting his hopes up. And I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to hurt him again.
And then the other part of me thinks: what is wrong with me? This amazingly wholesome and apparently rich person wants to get with me and treats me and everyone else with respect and why the heck don’t I like him back? Ugh.
And now, because of Corona, who knows if any of this even matters anymore. Ugh","6532. So I’m scared I may be leading on my good friend without intending to. :-(
Some context: we’ve known each other for about a year and a half now. We met last year thru a study group and we’ve become very close friends, able to talk about all kinds of things ranging from... idk super serious existential crisis to stuff all the way to kinks/fetishes we’ve always wanted to try. Super open w/ each other.
Also worth saying he buys me stuff somewhat often. Like, we’ll go to cream and he’ll be like, “my treat!” and when I asked him about it, he says it’s just like... he recognizes his privilege cause his family is well off and so he likes to occasionally spoil his friends. Okay, fine. I’m poor as dirt, so if somebody wants to buy me ice cream or dinner occasionally, then I’m not stopping them.
Then this year, this January, he shot his shot. Said he realized over the xmas break that he had feelings for me cause of how much he missed me. And even though he is legit one of the sweetest people I’ve ever met, I’m just not into him that way. Besides, I’m young—I wanna explore and be a slut for a bit—I don’t want anything serious right now. So I told him no thanks and I hope we can still be friends.
And I know that hurt him a lot. It hurt to see him hold back tears (Dumb toxic masculinity), but we bounced back and we’re still good friends... except ever since, I feel weird about him buying me things. It feels wrong even though he had done it before. I feel strange talking to him about my sex life or who I’m crushing on, so I don’t. I feel myself pulling away, even though he’s done nothing wrong and has handled rejection so unbelievably well.

He’s the sweetest and I know he would never hurt me, and I would never hurt him like that. Both before I was cuffed and now I receive messages from guys who are obviously trying to hit on me. When I was single I would flirt a little before shutting them down but now I obviously don’t flirt back. But it does make me feel good that guys still think I’m hot even though I would never act on it. Is that considered cheating? Idk, and I never bring it up to my boyfriend because I wouldn’t want him to get jealous (although ngl it would be kinda cute to see him get jealous). He does know that guys have hit on me before but I only tell him stories about when I was single and only if he specifically asks. Is it normal to feel like this, or am I crossing the line? Sometimes I still think about some of my previous flings, but I was never attracted to those guys in the same way I love my boyfriend. I imagine guys must also think about previous relationships so I don’t see that as inappropriate, and it was all in the past. I’m just not sure about getting attention from men while in a relationship and liking it, because it’s personally more of something that boosts my confidence rather than me having any desire to cheat.

They practice social distancing strictly and encourage others to do so. My family and I struggle so hard to stay home and it's mentally exhausting.
Recently, my dad was tested positive for COVID and my mom is quarantined and waiting for the result. They both worked so hard to treat people suffering with COVID. They worked overtime almost everyday and I felt so bad for them.
Today, I saw a group of people walking around without masks taking grad pictures and laughing like pre-COVID days. I'm so angry and upset how people decided to go onto campus without a single mask gathering together talking and playing sports. The 6 feet rule doesn't even exist here at Cal. I just want to tell you that COVID doesn't care whether it's your graduation day or not, and medical people like my parents are fighting so hard that they sometimes fall down like any other patients.
I'm so angry, upset and crying while writing this confession. Why does it has to be my parents? Why can it be the people who are enjoying their social life out there? Why people don't understand how fast COVID can spread and kill people? And why did my parents become doctors? WHY? I really want them to quit. DAD. LOOK. look at our school. People don't care what you do. They walk around and play around and infect 10 times more than the number of patients that you treated today. Just quit dad.

Being away from Cal has its pros and cons, but if there's one thing that I really miss about being at Cal is that there were so much more diverse locations for me to have my severe depressive mood swings compared to just my bathroom and bedroom :D
(Apologies if this triggers or offends anyone, definitely not trying to make light of my own or maybe others' mental health issues and yes, I'm in therapy lol I just need to use humor to talk about my depressive episodes because otherwise I struggle talking about it at all lol)
So without further ado, here's some rankings of some of the places I've had depressive episodes/contemplated suicide while at Cal. Enjoy!
-McCone Hall Balcony: Ugh would NOT recommend. One time I could feel myself losing touch with reality and wanted to go outside to try and calm myself down. EXCEPT some couple wanted to watch the sunset together for like 40 minutes. So there I was shaking in some plastic chair next to the door and trying to think good thoughts while waiting. When they finally left it was really cold outside and I thought about jumping for a sec, but there were way too many passerbys and the fear of people staring at me in reproach for interrupting their busy schedules by jumping in front of them was enough to send me running down the stairs (3/10 because the view was kind of nice :P)
-Mainstacks: If you haven't studied alone and contemplated all of your life decisions or if you're even happy with your life in the silence of Mainstacks then you clearly have the mental stability I lack and honestly I applaud you for that. (6/10 because turning the wheels on the bookshelves is actually a fun little hit of serotonin that I desperately need)
-Flyering on Sproul- I had to flyer for a club one day and I was particularly going through it that week. So you bet the only thing I was able to do to keep myself from breaking into tears in public was to sit down and pretend I was working on my laptop for my whole shift. So I didn't really give out a lot of flyers that day, sorry team :( (0/10 because getting ignored and rejected by people while flyering and having social anxiety is already bad enough yo)
-3am walk through campus on a rainy night- These just HIT different y'know? Got spooked once though because I heard someone running really loudly right behind me and then had to laugh because I was more scared of being chased than I was of the possibly dying part. Imagine being more scared of physical exercise than dying for a hot sec ahahaha but turns out it was just a runner with a really weird running schedule. Hope he's doing okay. Also bonus points if while you're sadly walking in the dark, you 're also listening to a special song/soundtrack that you specifically reserve for when you're at your lowest points. Mine are Claire de Lune and Stars by The XX and I honestly can't explain why (7/10 because i miss her :') )
Bonus:
-During any final ever: Bonus, because yes I did also have a mental breakdown during my online finals so it's now also partially off campus lol! Thank god none of my classes did Zoom proctoring because I would've felt so bad for the TA who would've had to awkwardly stare at me sobbing while taking a test. Kind of hope though that they somehow secretly monitored my mic to make sure I wasn't cheating so that they'll pity me and grade my finals leniently :') Anyways if we get to go back to campus for fall sem 2020 and you catch someone staining their test papers with tears, just please look away sir :o (-2/10 because I can't see the test questions with tears in my eyes rip)","6519.

Mine are Claire de Lune and Stars by The XX and I honestly can't explain why (7/10 because i miss her :') )
Bonus:
-During any final ever: Bonus, because yes I did also have a mental breakdown during my online finals so it's now also partially off campus lol! Thank god none of my classes did Zoom proctoring because I would've felt so bad for the TA who would've had to awkwardly stare at me sobbing while taking a test. Kind of hope though that they somehow secretly monitored my mic to make sure I wasn't cheating so that they'll pity me and grade my finals leniently :') Anyways if we get to go back to campus for fall sem 2020 and you catch someone staining their test papers with tears, just please look away sir :o (-2/10 because I can't see the test questions with tears in my eyes rip)",,1593491422,,,13,2,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2710359062573848&id=2156420374634389,
2710431739233247,"6518.5 Okay so I just noticed that a confession I submitted was posted, surprisingly (6501, which was a poll asking if a crush changing their hairstyle and you thinking ‘they look less attractive’ means if you’re moving on or not) and I actually forgot that I sent it in. I probably submitted it in May, I think? And I doubt this will get posted either but it’s almost July by the time I’m typing this. Absolutely no hate on the admin for the post-delay though!! (Side note: I love this page a lot btw, it gives me so much joy) It actually made me smile seeing it posted, reminded me of how frustrated I used to be at myself. I was experiencing unrequited love, and for some reason I wasn’t able to come to terms that he rejected me despite what happened between us in the past. I only saw the good qualities in him, and it seemed impossible for me to get over him. It took a hefty emotional toll on me during the pre-covid school year and partial quarantine (also —spoiler alert— I lied to myself when I said his new hairstyle made him look less attractive, if anything I thought it made him look different in an attractive way aha). Not gonna lie though, I find it fun for me right now to reflect on the progress I made since I submitted that confession. I’m still friends with him, but honestly quarantine has really helped me move on. it’s nice to not think about him constantly anymore, to really just focus on my own self-growth and things that matter to me most 🙂 We love some good character development aha. I know he’s on this page, and I have no clue if he’d ever realize this confession + 6501 + another one I submitted waaaaay long time ago were about him. But either way, I hope you’re doing well :)
Anywho, that’s it on my rant about finally finding my self-worth aha, never got closure with him but I guess I’m finding my own closure through this confession aha.
Stay safe, wash your hands, and go bears.

2710358785907209,"6518. So I've been dating this guy for a couple of years now. He has a very extensive dating history, which means he has exes anywhere and everywhere. To be honest in the beginning I didn't give it much thought, but now I'm starting to get concerned because even after these years he still seems to be hung up on his ex(es?). He doesn't really include me in his future plans but keeps telling me he loves me. But I'm actually going insane - you have no idea what it's like to walk around campus and see one of his exes and feel the need to hide, or listen to him talk about them on and on and on. I guess maybe it shows he was a popular guy? Maybe it shows that he was well-liked? It's frustrating though, and I can't tell if I'm overreacting or if I just need to break up with him. He keeps saying it's just the past, and that he's not actually still hung up on them, but I don't know what to believe.","6518. So I've been dating this guy for a couple of years now.

Autism is thought to be heritable. My mom thinks it comes from my dad's side of the family. I can see where she is coming from. My dad and grandfather, very smart people, but shit at human interactions. My sister is diagnosed with autism.
All my life my sister has received all the help to cope with her symptoms so the majority of my parents attention has been focused there. I feel as though I am autistic too. I struggle to connect with people. I can honestly say I don't have a best friend, or even someone that I text on an everyday basis that is not my family. And its always been this way. I have never expressed these feelings to anyone and have kept up this facade that everything is going well in my life. Telling people that everything is fine works because I am attractive. Who's going to think that the hot guy is lonely because he sucks at communication and basic human interactions? Not a lot of people. In part I believe this has to do with seeing my sister struggle to make friends and wanting to distance myself from that experience. She is not ""normal"" and if I feel the same things as her, then I am not ""normal."" I want to be ""normal."" But I can't go on forever thinking this is a healthy way to live. I want to get tested but its a mixed bag of feelings there. Getting diagnosed would go a long way to find justification for my own experience. I don't think its even possible now though. A big part of the testing is evidence from your parents, but if you hide your struggles from your parents and keep all these feelings bottled up inside how the fuck is that supposed to help? Its also harder to diagnose when you get older because people get better at masking their symptoms.
Whatever, at the end of the day I am probably just trying to find an out for being shit at life.","6514. CW: Controversial/Medically-debatable autism opinion

Because all the ""less attractive"" women who would be stuck with so-called ""loser"" men can end up in relationships with ""higher-status"" men. But then you end up with all the so-called ""loser"" men being incels.
So should polygamy be legal for the benefit of the ""higher status"" men and all the women? The feminist position says yes.

I had been sick right before the corona outbreak and right before classes had been moved online. I was feeling so horrible. I started having a huge fever. I had a terrible cough and I had no appetite. My cough and sore throat were so bad and I had problems breathing. I decided to go to the doctor which I never do and he couldn’t find anything wrong with me. He said I had symptoms but that the tests came back negative. I asked him about coronavirus and he said it was impossible because I hadn’t been out of the country. He couldn’t prescribe anything to me because of the negative tests and told me to wait it out and stay home. I didn’t.

2709228082686946,"6496. Some frustrating thoughts on the news.
Since the Pandemic started ramping up and even before shutdown (like late January), I've been watching the news to observe how the US is going to respond/progress along side the virus. Truth be told, I'm very disappointed as to how national US news stations are covering all the commotions in the US. And honestly, I agree with Donald Trump when he calls the news ""Fake News"" But more specifically, I think all news is Fake news. I believe the ultimate goal of journalism and reporting is to share credible and unbiased information, not to share their political opinions towards the information especially on air. I believe it is the viewers' responsibility to produce, exercise and own-up to their opinion. It's disappointing to see the news label and categorize issues as democratic or republican and/or insert their opinions into the conversation (like Cnn having quite dramatic conversations on air and having 10 minute ish opinionated talks by Chris Cuomo, Anderson Cooper to name a few although Anderson Cooper is very nice to look at or when Fox exclusively invites the President and other Far-Right figures to blurt out some Republican feel good words). While I sympathize and agree with much of what the news is reporting like the 100,000+ ppl dying from Covid-19 being ignored for the most part/the inaction of the gov, on testing George Floyds' (et al) unjust murders, immoral violent riots, Trump's photo op being unruly, and more, the news need not insert themselves and dramatize the situation further. Notice how the news describes everything like we're in a war even if they don't explicitly use the words ""war"" or ""battle"" and even when we are not experiencing a declared civil war. Notice how everything is described as a ""fight"" and the goal is to ""win that fight"" as if everything is about winning. I've found it very difficult to observe and develop my own opinions towards modern political issues and current events without feeling angry, ashamed, sad, and frustrated because it's difficult to access the entire situation when the news only focuses on 1% of the action - often times being very one-sided - and use such flamboyant yet uniquely militaristic/heroic language to describe such issues. I think the situations reported alone are severe enough to draw the action and attention of people as necessary. And Everyone is capable of generating their own opinions. Just tell it like it is and let the people discuss it.
I wish all news stations would report arguments from all sides of the political, cultural, economic, and artistic spectrum because it is only fair to the viewer to report issues analyzing all sides of the argument as they exist with the intention of respecting individual opinion development. **sighs** If only capitalism and the need for high viewer numbers were not at play.

I’m not the person my family remembers. I ignored my therapist’s calls, voicemails, and texts. I’m not brushing my teeth. I’m doing my damndest not to think. And, of course, I dropped out, too.
Why do this? Why do that? Why do anything? SO PASSÉ! God, why don’t you just go jump off a bridge and rid us of your nonsense.

Wasting my time trying to stay happy

From that moment on I wanted her hand
And for the first time in awhile, I felt excitement
As the days went on she came in my dreams
Smiling and laughing together at memes
And as the sun went down and the stars came up
We would cuddle and stargaze until our eyes slide shut
She became a permanent resident in my mind
Always so sweet and kind and fine
Her smile could split stormclouds apart
And carved a path straight to my heart
She brought sunshine everywhere she went
Just the sight of her made me content
From that moment on I set my goal
To devote my all to her, heart and soul
She was a princess
Delicate and elegant with unbound beauty
I strove to become her knight
Protecting and defending with all my might
To be by her side was my only desire
It didn't matter whether I was friend or lover

I wanted her forever","6457. Here I am, in nowhereland

2705159243093830,"6456. I need your input, please read this because I want to learn and I know I'm not the only one. I am an ally for Black Lives Matter as an Indian person and understand the fact that America was built on slaves yet white people always forget that and our legal system, healthcare system, education system and prob way more systems actively discriminate against black people and other people of color as well as low-income people. And of course, this is just simplifying it. This the narrative that I use to educate myself and others.
But I just am finding it hard to understand why all of a sudden, people are hating on me and my family just because we are Indian. My parents grew up dirt poor, in poverty in fucking HUTS in a village. There wasn't even a bathroom, they shit outside in the woods with the elephants and snakes for the first 20 years of their lives. Because of how Indian democracy works or something, my parents were fished out of the villages by these people and given the opportunity to attend govt schools for free (like public schools in america). They worked their asses off over a FUCKING CANDLE LIGHT (1960s life) bc they didn't want to end up like their parents , worked part-time to support their families barely making it by and were the first ones in their families to go to college. Fighting against 200 years of british colonization, casteism and sexism and colourism, they became doctors and came to the US for a better life for their kids. Thanks to the 1965 immigration act that Black people had a huge role in passing, my parents got to come here for their educational background. But like... just because of their MDs and the model minority myth, doesn't mean they got shit! They moved to North Carolina with barely any money, they had no family or friends and barely knew English. They were alone and people (white and black people) constantly made fun of them for their ethnic/second-hand clothes and their accents and their dark skin. They endured all of this racism yet kept their heads down and were persistent and saved money even when they made more than their means. 35 years later, they're upper middle class and have literally bought themselves their reputation through hardwork, their degrees and their earnings. I get that this experience differs from the Black experience, but why does that demean their experience? They struggled so much, they got nothing handed to them other than the immigration act that let them in this country. They got no benefits! I don't understand why people are devaluing experiences of immigrants like my parents. I KNOW many immigrants come to this country with this background too, as refugees or whatever else it may be. People might think this is a troll or a joke, but straight up this is how my parents grew up and how many of my indian/southeast asian friends parents grew up too.
I think it's unfair and wrong. I just wish people would stop putting down other people's experiences just to validate their own. And I'm sure rich black people face way less discrimination that black people of other socioeconomic statuses, why aren't we giving them shit for not investing their communities more? A lot of other ethnic groups do this, they reinvest in their own communities because we sure as hell know white people don't give a fuck about us. I do agree that minorities have to invest more in other minorities and that white people need to invest in EVERY fucking minority but is it wrong if its not my priority over my own ethnic group or people with similar experiences like my parents or the community in which I grew up?
I'm just confused and I know I'm not the only one with these messy opinions. I'm open to learning, I just want the un-sugarcoated opinions NOT FROM WHITE PEOPLE but from other people of color please.

Self-deprecation is fine because you know what you feel comfortable poking fun at about yourself, and people usually find it funny. It's also humbling too. But then, people take that to their advantage to roast you as a way of getting out their insecurities, and when they hit one of your insecurities you would NEVER make fun of, it really sucks. And yeah, I do speak out against it sometimes and either express discontent or disagreement, but it's usually met with, ""Damn why are you so mad"" or ""Stop being so butthurt.""

Idk what it is about me, but whenever I'm working in a group, my ideas are almost always the first ones to get shot down and discarded. It's not like I think that my ideas are necessarily better; rather, they're quickly met with skepticism and disregard. For instance, I remember when I was working on a project for a class and nobody was listening to my idea. They kept calling it infeasible, too complicated, ugly, etc., but were feeding off of each other's ideas in some massive circle-jerk and leaving me behind. And in the end, the idea they had failed pretty horribly, but they were desperate, so when I came in and basically said, ""Hey, how about my idea again?"" they finally relented (because we didn't have much time and they were desperate) and went with my idea, and our professor ended up loving our project and we all got perfect scores.
Maybe people don't listen to me because I'm quieter, or because my ideas seem unconventional to them. I'm not expecting them to accept them though; rather, I just feel like people don't even give me a chance. I've even had my work in clubs straight up disregarded or scrapped (without consulting me beforehand, of course), as if my thoughts and ideas are always the first to go. It's like people disrespect me so much that they feel they don't even need to ask me before trashing my hard work and thoughts. It sucks.
It makes me wonder if this is just how the world is, and that I should ""suck it up"" and realize that it's better for me to just readily accept what the majority agrees upon (as workplace culture seems to assume), or if I'm doing something wrong that's preventing others from seeing the value in my work and input.

Basically I hear the argument a lot that ""having a black friend doesn't mean you aren't racist"" and stuff like that. On the surface that makes sense, I've definitely seen a lot of people who say they can't be racist bc of their friends/sexist bc of their wife/etc etc, and usually it's the people who are obviously sexist or racist.
Here's the thing though: those aren't _really_ their friends, right? They just think they are? Because when someone is your friend for real, I don't know how you can live with having a subhuman view of them, or holding any strong prejudice, and still call them your friend. Like, wouldn't you notice that you feel these kinds of things about a person who you supposedly like and trust? So if you were truly friends with someone, wouldn't it be impossible to hold those kinds of prejudices? Or do I just define ""friendship"" more narrowly than most people (I do have other reasons for thinking that might be the case)?","6365. @social-Justice peeps, can y'all explain something to me?

Thousands of thoughts race through my head
Do I have any real friends?
How do people perceive me?
How come my post didn’t get as many likes as she?
Am I good enough?
Why do my grades suck?
Will I ever be able to get a M.D.?

All these negative, cynical beliefs
Would eventually transform into positivity
Easier said than done
Too many failed attempts
Between mindset rests and guided meditations
I can’t win this battle
Not now, at least
Because even with all my efforts

And as I prepare for bed
I think of the things I did

I have been a TA for a long time, I've interned at two of {Google, Facebook, Two Sigma, Airbnb} and will graduate in 2021 with no college debt. I've always managed to do well in school, exceeding in the subjects I'm interested in and scrapping a A-/B+ in the subjects I didn't care for. In highschool I was an alright student but not the best. I felt like I barely got in here, and so I always had something to prove, that despite my background I belong here. But I still feel isolated on this campus.
I have friends and I study with ppl from time to time, but usually I do all my work alone and just check my answers. I don't feel like I have a go-to ""squad"" of friends. I usually spend my weekends with my roommates who I'm close with, but they're also pretty antisocial and we don't have many guests at our apartment. I don't ever sit next to friends in lecture since none of my friends ever seem to be in my classes, and whenever I try to make conversation with the ppl next to me it doesn't go anywhere. I can't imagine who I'd take grad photos with or sit next to on graduation.
It's weird because in highschool I was very social and I had a go-to group of people to hang out with all the time, I don't know what happened here. It felt like everyone already knew each other when I was a freshman, and the few times I tried to make friends ppl were just weird and awkward and didn't respond too much. Whenever I hang out with someone I always feel like they're only with me because there other friend's bailed on then it they want homework answers (happened before).
So I'm happy that I got a lot of milage out of college, but I feel like I missed out big time on the college experience. To incoming freshman, don't end up like me. It's ok to go out on a weekday. It's ok to fuck up one exam because you were partying with your friends the night before. You don't have to take every class you can because it's not going to make you feel better about yourself, and stop worrying so much about what employers will think. What really matters is the friends you have and the relationships and memories you create. You can end up at Facebook or Airbnb or Google or wherever you want with a lot less effort than you think, and you don't even need to work for a big name company like that to get decent pay, interesting work, and smart coworkers. Just have fun in college and learn lots. This goes for all majors, bit just EECS and CS.","6284. I come from a small town where nobody did CS and I have managed to become pretty successful.

2685462725063482,"6224. I never thought it would happen to me. Like everybody else, I knew it would be a possibility, you know, like I've seen people talking about it in my Facebook feed every once in a while. But I guess it just never seemed real, like it would happen to somebody else, some group of Others that I would never be a part of.
I guess I got cocky. In the past, I've always just gone about my day as normal and put in the effort, and it all went well. The danger never seemed to materialize, even though, every single time I tried, I knew there was this latent calamity just waiting to strike. Just waiting for me to make one small step.
Well, it's finally happened. It must've been about two weeks ago now, maybe a bit sooner (I wasn't really keeping track). I was just going about my day as normal, not really doing much, surfing the web, jacking off, all the usual things.
But then, an idea popped into my head. An idea that just seemed so good that I couldn't pass it up. One that I needed to tell to somebody.
And therein lay my problem. The idea was just too weird to text to my friends, too embarrassing to post on social media. It would've been the perfect thing to post on Twitter, but alas I don't have one. And so, obviously, what's the next best thing besides tweeting out random thoughts? Making a confession on this page.
I made the confession in about twenty seconds. Usually, I'd type it up, retype, retype again, think it through, edit some more, and then finally submit, but after eight of my confessions in a row getting posted, I didn't even think there was a chance that my confession would get denied. I'm funny, I thought, I'm in touch with the zeitgeist of my generation. I'm good enough to get any thought that pops into my brain posted. Oh how naive I was.
I know there's a delay, so when my confession didn't pop up in a week, I wasn't worried. But as time wore on, and more and more confessions were posted, the fear crept up on me. It would be posted soon, I kept telling myself, there's no way that my genius would get swept away by the mods. There's no chance I would be tossed in with the garbage confessions that this page gets every day.
And yet I knew. The creeping dread slowly became my reality. My confession was cut out. My thoughts were garbage. I am garbage.
I spiraled. My entire self-worth, which had been based on getting confessions posted, was shot to hell, and I found myself questioning my very existence. I could not look at myself in the mirror. I could not eat. I could not breathe. If not for my extensive collection of anime body pillows, I do not know if I would have kept my sanity. My life was fracturing before my very eyes.
But from these depths, an idea emerged. One that would save me from these perils. One that would allow me to climb out from this pit of despair. And as I thought on this idea, I knew it would work. I knew that if I made a confession that had no content or purpose but was extremely long, the mods would have to read the entire thing before they realized that I was just wasting their time. Get fucked, mods. Try censoring my posts again, just see what happens. I'm buff as fuck.","6224. I never thought it would happen to me.

Usually, I'd type it up, retype, retype again, think it through, edit some more, and then finally submit, but after eight of my confessions in a row getting posted, I didn't even think there was a chance that my confession would get denied. I'm funny, I thought, I'm in touch with the zeitgeist of my generation. I'm good enough to get any thought that pops into my brain posted. Oh how naive I was.
I know there's a delay, so when my confession didn't pop up in a week, I wasn't worried. But as time wore on, and more and more confessions were posted, the fear crept up on me. It would be posted soon, I kept telling myself, there's no way that my genius would get swept away by the mods. There's no chance I would be tossed in with the garbage confessions that this page gets every day.
And yet I knew. The creeping dread slowly became my reality. My confession was cut out. My thoughts were garbage. I am garbage.
I spiraled. My entire self-worth, which had been based on getting confessions posted, was shot to hell, and I found myself questioning my very existence. I could not look at myself in the mirror. I could not eat. I could not breathe. If not for my extensive collection of anime body pillows, I do not know if I would have kept my sanity. My life was fracturing before my very eyes.
But from these depths, an idea emerged. One that would save me from these perils. One that would allow me to climb out from this pit of despair. And as I thought on this idea, I knew it would work. I knew that if I made a confession that had no content or purpose but was extremely long, the mods would have to read the entire thing before they realized that I was just wasting their time. Get fucked, mods. Try censoring my posts again, just see what happens. I'm buff as fuck.",,1590958820,,,40,13,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2685462725063482&id=2156420374634389,

Holy shit I am with you. For me it was never physical abuse but rather psychological. It was always written off as oh you had strict Asian tiger parenting, and even now although I try to explain to my mom the effects of that parenting on my psyche, there’s been no true acknowledgement of the damage they did to me. She understands that I don’t want to come home and that it’s stressful for me to be at home. But all the hurtful words, the limitations on my activity outside the house, the complete lack of privacy that was given to me, whether physical or digital? “Aiyah, look at the girl you were back then, we had no choice.” Or the violent outbursts of my father? “Well you made him angry, you know you shouldn’t do <insert behavior>.” Like fine. I know. Nobody’s perfect. I was disrespectful and talked back sometimes. I engaged in reckless teenage behaviors like having close friendships where we communicated online. Yeah, wild that sometimes I got a C on a test. I had a 4.0 unweighted GPA thanks to their efforts but I’d throw all of that away for a chance at a normal, happy high school life.
Now, I get called selfish and self pitying when I try to bring up these reasons as to why I don’t really seek a relationship with my father, or my mother to some extent. I’m ungrateful. I’m distant. Like I’m sorry I’m just trying to maintain the barest semblance of a relationship with my family so that you’ll still pay for my tuition. Is it exploitative if I do this? If your parents raise you and give you all the tangible benefits that they possibly can, but gaslight you and isolate you every step of the way, am i wrong for still taking their money while also not being totally enthused about maintaining a relationship?
And to all y’all who’ve had similar experiences, TALK ABOUT IT. please. STOP writing this off as normal Asian parenting. You say it doesn’t affect you but maybe you’re like me and you just write trauma off with “it just do be.” Honey it don’t just be. Yeah you wanna put the past behind you and just go on boba runs and rave every weekend like your life is all perfect now and there’s no point dwelling on the past. You’re lying if it didn’t affect your sense of self worth, at the very least. Stop whoring after that elite model minority image. Because we’re not an elite model minority if we can’t be honest within our community about the prevalence of controlling and abusive behavior that gets swept under the rug.","6208.5 @5859

2683847641891657,"6203. I am one of the very first confessions on this page, like maybe #60 or so. In my original confession I talked about the guilt I felt about not dating Asian guys. A lot has happened since then—in particular, becoming single after a long series of back-to-back long-term relationships. Needless to say, I’m not dating for a while, but I really took to heart one of the advices (out of many unhelpful ones) on my original post, which was to befriend Asian guys. I did that, and you were absolutely right, so thank you!
Okay, now for the maybe not so wholesome part; I’m increasing my representation of Asian men by going on Tinder and actively swiping right on Asian guys that I find cute and letting them know how cute and handsome they are. As I understand it, Tinder is casual and I’m allowed to have preferences. I figured this was not harmful and I think it’s really sweet how they react. They actually also return the favor and talk about how pretty I am, and it makes me blush. I never really thought I was the kind of girl that Asian guys would find attractive (I’m kind of thick for conventional standards, my voice is annoying, not very traditional, etc.), but they actually seem disappointed that we can’t meet in person because of this quarantine. I didn’t expect to heal the negative narratives I had internalized about Asian men this way and it’s really convinced me that representation is everything. In this case, representation of Asian/Asian-American men as sexy lovers. ;)","6203. I am one of the very first confessions on this page, like maybe #60 or so.

She’s super nice and compassionate (she’s the type that gives money to hobos all the time cause she feels bad for them) and so is her dad is super nice so it’s not that their family is bad people like the Park Family. BUT seeing how easy her life Is in never having to worry about money and never has money dictate her choices makes me feel super jealous and unfair that her life is so easy and great and she must have had such a spoiled and good upbringing like privately educated but also how her family must have depended on poor people like myself just like the wealthy Park and poor Kim.

2674202806189474,"6098. I live with just my dad. My dad has a history of mental illness, and he's struggled mentally a lot at times. A month ago, he lost his job at his company. And then, he had a breakdown because he couldn't understand what happened to him. We didn't know what we were going to do with money. He couldn't handle the stress and frustrations, so he went into the hospital for a week.
I couldn't go back to my college job, and my dad didn't have a job, so we were struggling financially. Bills were coming in, and it made me feel less of a, not even, a human being.
So we tried to bounce back by selling our car and cutting back on any unnecessary spending.
Then, in the beginning of April, I applied for a grant through a non-profit that would give money to struggling families that need financial assistance. They gave us a $500 micro grant, and, even though it wasn't a lot, this grant gave my dad the confidence to continue looking for a job. And this week, he finally landed a new job albeit one with a significant pay cut.
When my dad finally received the $1200 stimulus check, it gave him a new sense of a hope, a new sense of direction, and I saw him crawl out of his anxieties. I had a newfound appreciation for financial security, and the fact that these little things you take for granted: having a stable job, financial security, and healthcare all seemingly become so much more important when the nail hits the coffin. Through these experiences, I realized that if people aren't living in this scarcity, then maybe it will turn, maybe, the mental health of this country might turn around a little bit.","6098.

2674180236191731,"6086. I'm asian and I am inherently intimidated by white people because I feel racially inferior to them. When I meet new white people, I feel way more insecure than I would be around someone of another race (which is already pretty insecure and self-conscious). I don't feel any antagonism towards white people by any means by the way, it's just that I feel more recognizant of a white person's opinions of me than someone of another race, so I become much more reserved and not myself around them. This entire realization that I was specifically insecure around white people is really recent, and I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out where this 'racial insecurity' came from. Looking back on my childhood, I think I subconsciously built this idea that white people are the superior race (even though I morally disagree with that). Maybe it was how everyone in my predominantly-asian grade school (including myself) had a crush on the white people (also the most popular kids), who would 95% of the time only date other white people; or how white people always seemed to be better than the asian kids in p.e class; or how white people just seemed to be more socially-aware/cooler (first people to date, drink, smoke, etc.). Growing up, the white kids seemed like they were untouchable. It didn't matter if someone was an asshole, as long as they were white, they appeared to be revered by the people around them regardless. So, I think that all these teeny things manifested themselves in my mind and made me feel like I mattered less than white people. Just to make this clear by the way, I don't mean to blame white people at all, or be racist against them... on that note, maybe I'm being racist against my own race? I REALLY REALLY REALLY don't want to feel this way, because I !!KNOW!! that all races are equal! This is probably just a problem with me more than anything that I just need to get over. No idea how to though. Idk, anyone else feel the same way or just have advice or thoughts in general?","6086.

2671834726426282,"6058. cw: disordered eating
tldr: going to cal helped me manage my eating disorder and bc of covid I am relapsing :(
I suffered with an eating disorder until I came to Cal. In high school, I was surrounded by negative comments about my body and friends making negative comments about theirs almost constantly. I was extremely active, to the point it was harmful. I didn’t eat enough to sustain my level of activity and drank 2-3 cups of green tea a day hoping it would help. it became worrisome at the doctor, when I went in repetitively for a dance-related injury that wouldn’t heal. I wasn’t able to run after that, but had a heavily physical job that kept me burning calories.
When I came to berkeley, I wasn’t around the same negative comments as much. On the contrary, I had a lot of people “complimenting” how skinny I was. Though theoretically just as harmful, it helped me feel like I could start eating regularly again. I gained weight my freshman year, but my injury finally healed as a result. I was able to run again, but just because I wanted to, maybe once a week. I started having sex for the first time in my life. no one in my hometown found me attractive, but I suddenly found myself getting d*cked down by hella attractive guys worshipping my body lmao. when my friends from my hometown would visit though, it would come back. They would talk about their bodies in such harmful ways, and in comparison I knew my body wasn’t anywhere near as good or small as theirs. i would panic and not eat for a day or two, but then things would go back to normal. Now that i’m back home bc of covid, years after initially coming to cal, i’m stuck seeing people post about their weight loss plans for quarantine, ads about intermittent fasting and weight loss supplements, etc. whenever someone posts memes spreading shit like “lol i’m getting so fat in quarantine :((“ I secretly stalk their profiles and 99% of the time I wish I could be as skinny as that person. my instagram feed is flooded with throwback vacation bikini pictures from people I love, but are causing me indirect paint. i’ve been missing most classes because it’s easier to not eat if i sleep through them. it’s a vicious cycle at this point & im considering deleting social media, but fear feeling isolated in a time of need.","6058. cw: disordered eating

2671828879760200,"6053. I need to rant about this distance learning shit.
TL;DR: It would be much more beneficial for everyone if we abandoned this idea that classes during this time should resemble anything like what they would during a normal term (in regards to grading weight and leniency, number and length of assignments and ""live"" participation).
I will admit freely that I don't go to UCB anymore (I transferred to a different UC), but alas I feel many of us are in the same boat.
Can professors just like... stop? Expecting? So? Much? My motivation to do fucking anything has fallen so fast. I'm so depressed. I'm trapped in my tiny ass room inside my tiny ass house with my parents who fucking hate each other. I can't concentrate on anything and/or can't find the meaning in doing it anymore. I have fucking mountains of readings and homework that I have to do that are so god damn boring and irrelevant. I know that classes have a ""free"" P/NP option now, but even those require you to get a 70% in the class and I don't fucking know if I could even pull that off. I'm staring at the mountain of midterms and essays that I have to do and I can't possibly fathom how I'm going to get anything done. I have 0 original thoughts. My mind doesn't have the time to focus on 8-10 page papers when my brain is instead prioritizing ""how do I make sure that I don't feel like dying today?"".
And Fuck. Zoom. I fucking hate that shit. IDK if this is everyone's experience but I only have like 1 class where the information is being presented in any way that is actually helpful. I know this isn't feasible for every class/ major, but I would 100x prefer a professor just record a lecture with some slides and put that shit up on YouTube. WHY DO (most of) THESE CLASSES HAVE TO BE LIVE?! There's no point anymore! I've taken a handful of online classes during non-pandemic times, and they all just recorded their lectures rather than expecting anything from anyone attendance wise. At my UC, my last week of winter quarter was moved from in-person to online and the only class with any content left had YouTube videos up so fucking quickly (like, within a day of the notice going out). There's the argument that you can record Zoom lectures, but it's not the same. With a platform like Zoom, there's a certain level of ""participation"" expected, even if it's just in the chat. And some professors willfully REFUSE to record their Zoom sessions as to inspire said participation in a ""live"" setting. I'm not getting the same quality of education. I'm not getting a lecture that follows a syllabus with accompanying slides or readings, I'm getting an hour and a half ""discussion"" about things that are ""interesting""/ tangential to the main points. Tangents that won't be required to know for tests and yet take up 3x the amount of time in lecture.
Like. I'm just exhausted trying discern what is expected of me, how lenient everyone is going to be, and how I'm going to make it through all of this. My GPA was finally starting to look happy again, and this shit is going to ruin it all one way or another. I'm mad.

Preparation of the red pudding is very easy. You grab the animal of choice (I prefer duck) by the neck, and slit the throat just enough for the warm blood to poor out onto the plate or bowl. You then mix the blood with fish sauce to prevent premature coagulation, quickly add your minced meat and organ to give the pudding body, let it set for a bit outside, then put it in the fridge.

I barely went to section to the point where I didn’t know this mans name or where section even was. We barely spoke. I had to take the final early, sitting alone with him in a room for 2 hours.

I haven’t had sex in so long and it was the oxytocin dose I needed since December. We made out before and after every meal, and it was a pretty good time, but tbh he had trouble staying hard so that was something to work with. He would surprise me with kisses when I woke up and it was one of the best feelings I’ve ever had.
Fast forward to now, he just friend zoned me a month after seeing me. I wanted to see him and his sexy lips wrapped around mine so bad after this quarantine, but I guess he wasn’t meant to be.

I think about you everyday, and my heart gets heavy, and my eyes well up in tears. I won't ever cry them out because I've become almost incapable of expressing emotions, or feeling anything except when I'm talking to you.
I think about the things you do. The movies you love. The way you laugh. I hold myself back from mentioning you in daily conversations with my friends and family, because if I say it out loud, everything becomes real. These feelings are safe tangled up with my other thoughts. I can push them back in to the mess if they surface, and pretend that they are fake.
I think about this situation a lot. You know what scares me the most? That I'm imagining all of this. The second you become single, I will lose interest in you. That the only reason I'm in love with you is because you're unattainable. It's disgusting to think that I'm that kind of person, but I'm disgusting enough to have caught feelings for someone who has a girlfriend.
I think that sometimes things are meant to happen. Maybe this was meant to happen. I was supposed to experience this level of heartache. Every time we hang out my heart aches to tell you. But I can't - so I'll just stay quiet and let those awkward-tense pauses pass by. I keep waiting for the perfect moment.

2666177613658660,"5985. Lately I have been very confused with my sexuality and since COVID-19 happened, I’ve been stuck at home all day thinking about it. Some context: I’ve always liked/had crushes on girls for as long as I can remember but I’ve never been sexually attracted to them. And the funny thing is I am sexually attracted to guys but I have never once been romantically attracted to a guy. If this sounds ridiculous well I find it ridiculous too. The four people that I’ve told think I’m completely crazy, that I’m gay, or pretending that I’m not gay. Probably because, more context, I’ve lost my virginity to a guy. It was fun and he wanted to pursue things further but I just could not bring myself to be interested in him romantically at all. He felt it and we drifted apart. Its like that with porn too. Every time I’m jack off to guy porn, sure I enjoy it in the moment, but I feel weird at the end and just want to get it out of my sight. I can’t jack off to girl porn.
For a long time I thought I was having imposter syndrome, I thought I was subconsciously forcing myself to like girls because of societal pressure and my own background. My parents and relatives are very conservative and do not support the LGBTQ community at all. The town that I grew up in was also very conservative. So I was ready to just come out as gay, but recently, I fell head over heels in love with one of my girl best friends. I can’t stop thinking about her. Its the first time in my life I’ve experienced something like this but I actually get butterflies in my stomach every time I see her. I just feel like Zoom calling her everyday (but I haven’t confessed so can’t do that yet). I really don’t think my subconscious could possibly make up feelings this strong. But, I’m still not sexually attracted to her. I love her but don’t want to have sex with her.
So this is why I am confused. Idk how to present myself. I clearly can’t be gay, but I’m definitely not straight, and I don’t think I’m bi since I’m not sexually and romantically attracted to both genders. The thing that irks me more is that I feel like everyone thinks I’m making this all up. I don’t blame them but its really frustrating and lonely sometimes. I feel like there must be someone like me out there that understands how it is to have attractions in two different ways to two different genders. It sucks and I wish I could just call myself something and figure it all out. Sure sexuality is a spectrum but I never asked for this messed up version that I have.","5985.

The way I see it is I didn’t choose to be familiar with these people, and why in the world would I devote my time to them and care about their birthdays and weddings? We only live once and I have limited time and I want to be close to people who I actually like and actually have things in common with, not a bunch of people who happen to be related to me. Don’t get me wrong these people are not horrible in any way and they are pretty loving, I just would rather spend time with my friends and I frankly don’t care about their lives.",,1588782623,,,14,3,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2665343503742071&id=2156420374634389,

I’ve tried FaceTiming, and calling and messaging him everyday and he doesn’t reply to my calls or FaceTimes saying “I don’t like to FaceTime” although I’ve seen him FaceTime some female friends in the past. He’s also going back to Berkeley next week after being in our hometown for a month because he said “I want to have my freedom back”. To which I replied “freedom for what, you can’t go outside everything is closed”. He is seriously going back for the soul purpose that his parents don’t let him go out too frequently because of the pandemic, although he shouldn’t be going out at all. It hurts my feelings because he’d rather risk his life and those around him than stay at home and be in the same city as me at the very least.

She basically sleeps over every night and we have gone on trips to Canada which is where we’re both from and basically lived together in our Airbnb’s for like a couple days, and since we’re both graduating I just think that this is the best next step. I know she loves me, and she knows I love her with all my heart. She’s my first and only love. I love her so much, she’s my whole world and I would want nothing better than to wake up next to her every morning and make her breakfast and just do normal couple things together like Costco runs or IKEA adventures. I love this girl and I really picture myself marrying her one day, but I understand when she thinks it’s a little too soon. But this last time we went to Canada I woke up made her breakfast while she started washing the dishes and I looked back and I could see forever with her, i could see a future with kids and grow old together the whole 9 yards, so I hugged her and kissed her on the top of her head, she’s my person. So I said, “Hey, why don’t we just live together”, she said “yeah that would be really nice” this was while we were still in Canada. But then we came back to the states and, when I brought up living together she said “it would never work out”, it broke my heart, I love her, and I respect her decision, but why would she say something like that? It makes me so sad, because I just love her so much in such a wholesome way, I don’t understand.","5952.

So everytime my roommate snores, I will make noises just loud enough for them to wake up and holy fucking shit are you a heavy sleeper sometimes I've thrown hardcover textbooks onto the hard floor like 2 feet away from you and you still dont wake up but the point is that if I'm not getting sleep BECAUSE OF YOU then sorry motherfucker you ain't getting sleep either. I also generally take a while to fall asleep so when you somehow fall asleep like 2-3 minutes later (I'm actually jealous) then I have to repeat the process again. I'm 100% not sorry for this since if I'm paying tens of thousands of dollars to be stuck in a tiny room with someone then at the very least I should have a quiet space where I can sleep? I mean if you had to make a choice between your rest and well-being and the the rest and well-being of someone preventing you from getting any, you would have to have beta energy levels of over 9000 to choose them over yourself.","5939.

I filled it out because of my roommate and was curious to see who I would be matched with. I was lonely coming to Berkeley and I thought I would find a potential friend or maybe even boyfriend. Once I was given my match, my roommate encouraged me to reach out to him. I wish I didn't.
At first, he seemed enthusiastic and we talked for about a month; nothing heavy just stuff about our day and whatnot. Then around a month ago, he asks me if I want to meet up. Granted this is the first time I am meeting him and the only images I have of him are from his practically empty social media platforms. We meet and when I laid my eyes on him for the first time in person I was in awe. His eyes captivated me. I couldn't look away for a solid minute. Throughout our entire encounter, I could feel myself falling for him. His awkwardness made my heart melt. We ended up hooking and he spent the night. All night I couldn't stop thinking about his arms around me, making me feel so small and safe. The next morning he left and I couldn't stop thinking about him.
Now, I'm back home and I still can't stop thinking about him. Every time I close my mind I see his face, his loop-sided smile, and beautiful light brown eyes. We still talk but every time he reads me on reading or just fails to respond breaks my heart. He said he wants to be friends and still is down to hook up once the corona thing clears up. He did mention in one of our talks that he doesn't want to date right now and of course, I said the same but hearing that broke my heart. I hate feeling so dependent on this one guy.

Occasionally, they'll open up to me and vent, but I have no idea how to respond. Do I say ""that sucks :("" ? Do I ask them how do they feel about it? What am I supposed to ask them? Am I supposed to sit there and say nothing? Most of the time, I end up responding with ""oof"" and honestly I feel really bad about it. I want to be there and help them out, but I have no fucking idea how to be great at listening to other people.
The saddest part is that they often come back to tell me more things and I pity them not because of what they have to say but that because among all the friends they could choose to open up to, they chose me? All of these friends are great people and sometimes I wish I could just pair them together to vent and listen to each other because they would probably be better off that way.

I’m not trying to be shallow but whenever we have sex i just don’t enjoy it as much so i’ve slowly stopped initiating. It’s not that I think he’s disgusting just bc he’s fat or anything, but it just bothers me that he lets himself go so easily. Especially bc I’m pretty fit and work out on a regular basis, and it takes a lot of will power for sure but it’s worth it. And I know he could lose weight if he tried but it’s like he doesn’t even care about his appearance anymore. And it makes me feel bad bc part of the reason I work out is so he’ll think I’m hot, but it’s like he doesn’t wanna try to be fit for me.

2658837324392689,"5894. I was a complete loser in high school and really all of my life up until college. Never really had a solid group of friends, was picked on a lot especially when I was younger, and always felt out of place. So when I started at Berkeley, I naively hoped things would be better even though deep down I knew they probably wouldn't be. And that's pretty much exactly what happened my freshman year. Our floor started out all being pretty close but slowly split into smaller cliques and I wasn't invited to be a part of any of them. I went into that summer thinking the same pattern had happened again and I'd probably graduate college in pretty much the same place I was in after high school in terms of my social life.
But then, sophomore year, things changed pretty dramatically. I decided to get more active in a club and it really paid off. I finally found a group of people I had similar interests with, and more shockingly, they actually seemed to want to get to know me. I became very active in the club and for probably the first time in my life felt like I truly belonged. When applications for officer positions rolled around, it was an easy decision to run and I was so excited to get started when I got the position. And overall, during and after my time on the board I always had many friends, got along great with everyone, and finally had a thriving social life. Berkeley has often times left me pretty broken with the way classes are here and how competitive it is in general, among other personal problems I dealt with. And yet, having such great friends helped me get through a lot of it.
This is probably going to sound pretty dumb but not long after I joined the board we had a retreat before the semester started and at one point we got lost (we were driving rental cars to the airbnb) so we all pulled over into some tiny parking lot in a town in the middle of nowhere and tried to figure out which road to take, and I remember looking around at everyone together and feeling like I had just peaked in life. Here I was, with an amazing group of people that I actually felt welcomed in, doing something fun together. Never in my life up until that point could I have imagined being invited to something like that or having that many friends at once. I got a similar feeling again this past summer when a few of my friends and I rented a car and drove down to Santa Cruz for a day trip. It weirdly brought back all these memories of going on field trips in elementary and middle school, especially since we were literally taking the same road as this one field trip in middle school where my class was going to see the tide pools at some state park along the coast. Everyone else was excited to be taking a trip with their friends while I sat alone on the bus and daydreamed of one day having friends to go on a trip like this with. It hit me so hard that wow, at this very moment, I'm doing exactly what I had hoped of doing 7-8 years ago or so.
Anyway, it's senior year now and thanks to coronavirus we're all at home and I haven't seen many of my friends in weeks and sadly didn't even get a chance to say bye to many of them in person before we all left. I've been feeling pretty insecure most of this year because I realized that for many of the people who I considered to be my friends, I was almost always the one who reached out or made the effort to hang out or maintain our friendship. I even did experiments where I wouldn't message or text anyone for a week unless they started the conversation, and the amount of people I talked to dropped drastically. This put me in a pretty dark place and made me doubt whether all the progress I thought I made of developing a social life in the last few years had completely failed and whether I'm still in the same place I was after high school. It then made me really sad to hear some people talk about being lonely now that we're all at home and how no one reaches out to them when they themselves weren't really initiating conversations. This isn't to call anyone out or downplay how they're feeling, but instead made me realize something else. Some people, myself included, struggle to be the one to text first sometimes. Everyone loves to be thought of or checked on by their friends but sadly it seems like not that many of us really take the step to do it.
So I realize I kind of went all over the place in this confession and haven't really gotten to the point yet, so I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm probably not alone in how I feel. Many of us probably also were not very social until college and now that we're back home and out of that bubble it can feel like we've reverted back to square one. So, please reach out to your friends. Send them texts or give them a call even if you don't have something specific to say. Getting a text from someone I haven't talked to in a while, even if it's just saying hi and checking in, can make my whole day. And I've heard similar sentiments from many others too. Yes, it seems stupid sometimes to just say ""hi"" but it really, really helps and makes us all feel more connected especially when we're all far from each other now. I've resolved to be more active with checking in on my friends and I hope that this unnecessarily long confession inspires someone else to do the same. It means a lot to feel like you belong, so let's all stay as close as we can.","5894. I was a complete loser in high school and really all of my life up until college.

2658836794392742,"5893. This is an open letter to Hilfinger. WTF was that 61b midterm we just took. Look, we are in the middle of a fucking GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Instead of being lenient and giving us a reasonable midterm to take, you gave an impossible test. Every single question was sososo hard. I get it, you think people will cheat so in order to mitigate that you make the midterm harder, but why would you make it impossibly hard?? and yeah, i know that you shifted bins in our favor, thank you for that. But please remember that a lot of us are in very difficult situations. I'm from a lower middle class family, at cal on financial aid, and my home situation is exactly ideal. I really tried my hardest to study for this exam and assumed it would be reasonable (MT1 was difficult, but It was reasonable), but this midterm was truly something else. After the midterm was over I asked my brother (MIT cs grad and SWE and facebook) if he could figure out a couple of the questions and he said he had no idea. So you're telling me in the midst of a global pandemic, already stressful home situations, and an extremely uncertain economic future, we are expected to take an IMPOSSIBLE exam??? Every single person I know in the class thought the exam was unreasonably hard and I'm sure that will show when they are graded. I knew hilfinger would be bad based on the all the drama i heard last year, but this just shows that he has no regard whatsoever for the mental health of his students. I'm so fed up with ""you are responsible for the sum total of all human knowledge"" NO WE ARE NOT. THIS IS A DATA STRUCTURES CLASS WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR KNOWING DATA STRUCTURES. I know this won't accomplish anything I just really had to get this off my chest and if this is somehow brought to hilfingers knowledge im begging you give us some mercy. I get that cs is a capped major you want less people to declare cs wtv wtv thats no excuse for giving unreasonably difficult midterms and projects. I'm really just trying to pass this class and learn enough so that I have a good foundation for upperdivs. Please understand that not all of us come from a cushy bay area upper middle class household with strong wifi, our own rooms, and ideal studying conditions (I share a room with 2 siblings and live with 6 other ppl in my house making for a non-ideal studying environment). Please please understand that these difficult times call for easier midterms/projects not more difficult ones.

2657124814563940,"5875. I remember in middle school, i never got enough sleep so i was always falling asleep in class. At the time, my family was struggling a lot so I was just really busy and barely slept. I was in a single parent household and because of that I had a lot of responsibilities. I would grocery shop, cook dinner, wash laundry, proofread their emails, and just do a lot of things around the house to ensure that my parent could keep their job. It was tough and hard but like I'm not complaining though.
Sometimes, I wonder why I was forced to grow up before I needed to. Am i bitter? In some sense, yes but that's just the way my life is and ... there's not much you can do about what happened in the past. And I'm here at Cal now so i guess I didn't turn out that bad.
I got a call from my school that was asking how things at home were. Apparently my english teacher reported me for always falling asleep in class so the administration called to see how things were.
I wish instead of reporting it, he could have just confronted me about it. It's not like I was taking drugs or was high off weed or some shit, so i was falling asleep. And it's not that I wasn't studious either (not to flex, but I did pretty well lol and still scored in the 99th percentile of my school lmfao -- but again this is a shitty public middle school so everyone dumb) but it's just that: life is fucking hard and that's just the way it is.
In high school, I moved to a more affluent area. I didn't really experience a lot of racism there because a lot of people looked like me. I didn't realize it at that time, but I had PTSD and social anxiety (and I still do to this day). My english class had participation points, and I remember reading in my evaluations that I was deemed as ""shy"" and ""doesn't contribute much to the conversation"".
I'm not asking for pity, and of course, it is not fair for professors or educators to be aware of the stigmas and personal challenges/barriers everyone has in their life. Let's also remember that it's hard enough for people to open up about very personal issues in their life, even much less to figures of authority. Is it necessary? Probably. Is it easy to do? Of fucking course not.
Which is another reason why I'm posting here, if it even gets posted lmfao. There's a lot of stigma around being poor -- you're poor because you're lazy ... your parents must not have been educated, your mistakes have led you to the life you're currently living, pull yourself up
by your bootstraps -- it's not that hard, you're on a full ride to this school -- what possible issues could you be having that prevents you from reaching your potential? Just get it together.
To be truthful, most of you that go here to this school probably have support in some way -- be it financial or emotional. Especially in higher education, most people are from well off backgrounds, be it middle class or higher. When you graduate you have something to fall back on: living with your parents or having your connections pull through in some way or whatever. Some people, like me, don't have that at all. When I graduate, I have nothing to fall back on. There is no sort of ""cushion"" whatsoever when the government stops giving me these grants.
I'm not asking or expecting you to understand ""poor people"" and I do acknowledge that just because you're privileged doesn't mean you're not hard working. I personally know a lot of my friends who don't need to work an ounce in their life, but they do, and yet they're very passionate about what they do. They are aware of their own privilege and they use those resources wisely to help their own goals and aspirations. It's not a bad thing. Obviously. Is it fair? Life isn't fair and it's not their fault they were born wealthy so that's just the way it is. And of course, everyone has their own slew of personal problems, whether it be family issues or mental health issues or whatever -- and just because you're privileged or wealthy it doesn't undermine your struggles. Everyone's struggles are valid period.
I'm just fucking saying that the next time you, whether you're just a student, an AI/LA, a TA, or a professor, see someone ""lazy"" don't fucking judge and impose your perceptions on that person based on your understanding of what ""lazy"" means. You don't know their life, you don't know what they're going through, so stop fucking judging. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.","5875.

And of course, everyone has their own slew of personal problems, whether it be family issues or mental health issues or whatever -- and just because you're privileged or wealthy it doesn't undermine your struggles. Everyone's struggles are valid period.
I'm just fucking saying that the next time you, whether you're just a student, an AI/LA, a TA, or a professor, see someone ""lazy"" don't fucking judge and impose your perceptions on that person based on your understanding of what ""lazy"" means. You don't know their life, you don't know what they're going through, so stop fucking judging.

So in response, Filipino people....adopted Christianity?? It just doesn't make sense. Furthermore, the Philippines was not devoid of religion before the Spanish arrived.

Can we talk about something really important??
Let's stop minimizing abuse experienced among us Asians. Really, for all races, but the stigma around physical and emotional abuse is ridiculous. It's very real, and just because ""all of our parents gave us smacks every now and then for ten, fifteen years+"", doesn't mean that it's okay. I know a lot of us grew up being slapped or hit with other things, but it doesn't mean we should invalidate what we've been through, or that much of that was likely traumatizing.
I have opened up to friends before, and they would either deny that it has happened to me, or say ""oh, but all of us grew up with it.""
I understand that for some people, it stopped at a certain age, or it never really bothered them.
But still, it's fucking real for some of us. I'm not asking for you to say anything really, I'm just asking you to accept it, accept how it's changed me, and NOT deny it. I hate the fucking stigma that if we open up about it, we're being dramatic or something.
Because if that's what you think, you probably haven't come to terms with the weight of what you might have experienced - you probably still haven't processed it... and you're kind of acting like our parents ultimately..... :(","5859. CW: physical abuse

It takes extra effort to pull that off, especially on phones: you have to disable auto-capitalization in your phone and undo autocorrect enough times that your phone learns your new texting slang. Is this what being ""edgy"" means? Is it some sort of American culture I don't understand?

We were doing long distance and I couldn't go home for spring break (she goes to school close to home) so it was going to be a long stretch w/o seeing her. We facetimed and texted often, I really felt like we were going strong. We'd been dating for close to three years at this point, I was feeling really solid. Then she expressed some concerns to me, the distance was wearing on her, etc. I told her to just look forward to the summer, we'd both be at home, it'd be fantastic, remember how great it was seeing each other over winter break, etc.
Then, a week after, we facetimed and she dropped it on me. First time being broken up with and man did it hurt. I kinda pride myself in being a pretty levelheaded person, some might say I'm a bit bland, but I'll take that. I did not handle this well at all. I was a fucking mess.

I didn't really have any friends to lean on either, I mean I have friends, but idk I didn't want to burden them with it.
Especially now that we're both home due to all of our classes moving online, it feels absolutely ridiculous that we can't see each other. If she had literally waited 1 more week we would have been seeing each other now. Of course she couldn't have predicted any of this shit, not faulting her for that, but man.

""Yes, pa,"" I would always reply. It was a regular occurrence for him to burst into my room unannounced while I was relaxing or doing homework.
""Y’all hitting that yeet?"" he would seeth.
""No, pa,"" I would answer.
""Good."" He would then walk out the room and shout, ""If I ever catch ya, it’s a thumpin’.""
It was a difficult upbringing. I had seen my friends hittin’ that yeet at school, and many of them encouraged me to partake.
I would swallow my pride. ""No thanks. I don’t wanna catch a thumpin’ from pa."" As a result, I was an outcast. A loner. I became depressed, knowing that I would never be like my peers, I would never fit in - I would never hit that yeet.
One day, when I was still but a wee lad, I became curious. I was in my room, watching Instagram videos of fellas my age hittin’ that yeet all over town without a care in the world. My intentions got the better of me. I stood up, my knees trembling. Carefully, I leaned onto my right foot and raised my hand in the air.
I breathed in.
""YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!""
My father burst from my closet. ""I told you I’d thump ya if I ever caught you hittin’ that yeet,"" he ejaculated. Then, he thumped me.

With confidence, I approached the podium. I gazed out upon the gathering of sad faces. I cleared my throat and leaned into the microphone.
""Yeet,"" I spake.
Suddenly, my father leapt from his hand-crafted mahogany coffin, the gunshot wound still in his chest. He sprinted up to the podium with the energy of a man without a gunshot wound in his chest.
""Y’all hittin’ that dirty fuckin’ yeet at my funeral?"" he ejaculated. He raised his hand to thump me.
""Not so fast, pa."" I grabbed his hand. ""Yaint thumpin’ no mo’.""
My father looked at me with eyes as open as the gunshot wound in his chest. A tear fell from his right eye, which also had a monocle. ""The student becomes the teacher,"" he said.

""Good."" He would then walk out the room and shout, ""If I ever catch ya, it’s a thumpin’.""
It was a difficult upbringing. I had seen my friends hittin’ that yeet at school, and many of them encouraged me to partake.
I would swallow my pride. ""No thanks. I don’t wanna catch a thumpin’ from pa."" As a result, I was an outcast. A loner. I became depressed, knowing that I would never be like my peers, I would never fit in - I would never hit that yeet.
One day, when I was still but a wee lad, I became curious. I was in my room, watching Instagram videos of fellas my age hittin’ that yeet all over town without a care in the world. My intentions got the better of me. I stood up, my knees trembling. Carefully, I leaned onto my right foot and raised my hand in the air.
I breathed in.
""YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!""
My father burst from my closet. ""I told you I’d thump ya if I ever caught you hittin’ that yeet,"" he ejaculated. Then, he thumped me.
I haven’t hit that yeet since.
Until today. This morning was my father’s funeral. At the procession, my brother asked me to say a few words. I told him I only needed one.
With confidence, I approached the podium. I gazed out upon the gathering of sad faces. I cleared my throat and leaned into the microphone.
""Yeet,"" I spake.
Suddenly, my father leapt from his hand-crafted mahogany coffin, the gunshot wound still in his chest. He sprinted up to the podium with the energy of a man without a gunshot wound in his chest.
""Y’all hittin’ that dirty fuckin’ yeet at my funeral?"" he ejaculated. He raised his hand to thump me.
""Not so fast, pa."" I grabbed his hand. ""Yaint thumpin’ no mo’.""
My father looked at me with eyes as open as the gunshot wound in his chest. A tear fell from his right eye, which also had a monocle. ""The student becomes the teacher,"" he said.
""The student becomes the yeetcher,"" I corrected him",,1587573030,,,190,150,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2651492021793886&id=2156420374634389,

I matched with this guy on tinder sometime early fall semester and talked to him for a bit. I was hella busy because of classes and personal problems and I definitely came off as not being interested in him. And then it just fizzled out after he told me he was seeing someone. That really set me back incredibly because it had only been a week or a week and a half of me being extremely caught up with other things and he had already found someone new. It was not at all that I was mad at him, I was mad at me for not communicating to him well.
And then fast forward about a week, I see him at a bar and I’m completely drained. Like, have you ever run into someone at a public place and completely lost your will to live? I don’t know when I became so invested in him or why, but I couldn’t get him out of my head since then. I texted him asking if he’d still wanna be friends - also because we kept running into each other pretty often and it was incredibly awkward to just keep walking. We talked about completely mundane things like classes and homework for about a week and then it ended again.
And I feel like shit about how I was with him because recently I’ve been trying to find myself and understand myself better. I know this shouldn’t bother me as much as it’s bothering me right now because from what I’ve described it doesn’t seem like we had much going on. But I kid you not, in a campus filled with fuck boys, he was a refreshing change.

2647267532216335,"5768. The girl I had a crush on since fourteen just posted in her SNS that she has made a boyfriend.
We met in a school play event in middle school. I still remember the very first moment I saw you - I only lived 14 years at that time, but when the afternoon sun after the summer rain glimmered on your school uniform, your hands and your face, I swear that was the most beautiful scene I’ve ever seen in my whole life. You looked towards me. I felt the world was quiet, the sound of other kids gone, and a strong blood flow went through my chest.
We became close - under my intentional but clumsy little plans. You’re everything I wanted to be. You’re understanding, determined and genuinely positive, always making people feel empowered, while I struggle to pretend understand other people’s feeling with my best efforts. But what is even scarier is that you seem to always be able to know what I’m thinking. I always tend to hide my emotions, but in front of you, I feel naked, and it gave me a weird sense of relief and comfort.
I remember the day you cried in my chest at fifteen, when I told you I got pretty sick and need to rest for half a year. I remember the day you handed me a cup of soil milk from McDonald’s after school, and the day I played you your favorite song on piano in the dark and empty school auditorium. My feelings for you were so painfully obvious that there soon was gossip that I had a crush on you. I sure did, but I always deny them - why did I do that? Because I was too shy? Scared of being refused? Or because I want to appear to be obeying to the school rule of “no on campus relationship” to appear grown-up and responsible? Once I even mustered up courage to asked you: don’t you feel there’s a lot of rumor of us dating? You answered: even so, so what? I didn’t understand what you meant then.
I worked hard to impress you. After middle school, you went to a different high school, one that’s famous for its eminence. I made the decision to go to the US for college because you wanted to do the same. “I’m done staying in this province, this country” - you told me - “I want to see something new.” Honestly, I only have a vague, if any, image on what was good outside our hometown, but since you said it, then there must be something out there. I trusted your words. I wasn’t as smart or achieved as you, so I worked hard. You told me your dream college. Stupid, timid and useless as I am, I thought if only I work hard, I can get into that school too, and maybe, just maybe, on a warm April afternoon, I can ask you out for a cup of coffee, talk about our teenage years, and say the words I had rehearsed countless times, the words that I have always wanted to say.
Naturally I wasn’t admitted to that school, just as naturally as you were. And you’re thriving there. You have everything I wish I had. You’re brave and you’re studying a major of your passion, while I just followed the path of most students from my country, choosing a hopelessly boring but practical major.
We gradually stopped contacting each other. Maybe it is because I thought this never ending emotion should be stopped, and it’s time for me to embrace my new life, just as you’re embracing yours. But I can’t. At nights like this, alone I pull my head up from the homework I drown myself with, shut down the laptop, lie in my bed, and in the darkness, countless times had I picked up the phone, looked at that little icon symbolizing you in the chatting app, and put it down. It had been too long and I feel awkward about what to say.
I realized what I’ve been living for for the past eight years. When I worked hard for math olympiad award in high school, when I became the president of one of my high school’s clubs, even when I bought some new clothes and looking at myself from the mirror - I wanted you to see it. I wanted you to tell me, wow, you’re smart. You worked hard. You’ve grown taller and more handsome than before. I can’t believe how stupid I was, but I was living for you.
I’ve met other girls in high school and college, while I’m away from you. Some of them - maybe around 4 so far - I find somewhat attractive. But no one had made me feel the same way as you did at fourteen. When a girl ask me out, I always find some excuse to refuse. I feel lost. I don’t know if I’ll ever meet another person who can see through my heart, and accept me as who I am. If a miracle were to happen, I want to go back to middle school. High school will also be fine. I will find you at the very moment, look you into the eye, and say the words that you probably have already known for a long time.","5768.

2647266782216410,"5767. You know that feeling when you realize one of your friends just… isn’t your friend anymore*? It’s so strange - two summers ago, perhaps we could have been considered rather close. Maybe entrusting each other with secrets and confessions didn’t mean much to you, but it meant something to me. I still remember that winter when I was so unreasonably resentful, and you talked to me for hours to distract and comfort me. And did telling me one of your most frightening experiences mean nothing to you? Did putting on all the pretenses of a friend mean nothing to you either? Late-night talks, listening to each other rant, giving advice, acting like you actually cared about me? I’m sorry that I interpreted your actions as signs that you were really my friend. I realize that I was wrong, and I won’t make that mistake in the future. It’s so ironic that you do this, since you say that you’ve been “betrayed and ‘left behind’” yet are completely ignorant, or uncaring, when you inflict the same damage on someone else.
I’m so tired of realizing that my friends were fake all along. It feels like everyone’s been deceiving me for my entire life. But honestly, I think I’m fine. I’m used to it, and you’re just the last one in a long list of liars and deserters. I’ve learned to be happy by myself, for the most part, and I will be grateful for the lesson our friendship has taught me.
See you later. I forgive you.
*This weekend, you drove to school and picked up one of your cousins to take to a theme park. The shitty thing is that you know that I live literally a few hundred feet away from her and you couldn’t even bother to say hi. I know this cousin’s sister has problems with me, but that’s easily solved. Even if that were unsolvable, you could at least directly let me know you’re in the area and explain yourself. The drive from your place to mine takes the better part of a day, and after all that, you can’t even acknowledge my presence? Initially, I was angry, but now I’m just disappointed and frankly unsurprised. I should have seen that coming.","5767.

In the last chapter of the manga, 3 years after Light dies, there's a wide spread epidemic killing majorly old people and the elderly. They just all started dying, and it's revealed to be another shinigami's death note in the human world. The average age of mortality for the coronavirus is 80. It's also ominous that a lot of cases pop up in the middle of nowhere in the USA. You can't use the deathnote to kill other people that don't have their names written, but in theory one person dying of the virus could infect other people and have them not die from it. This might explain why the coronavirus is so contagious, and why there is such an odd trend to the deaths it causes.","5762.

2645333979076357,"5733. I can't choose. I feel like everything in my life is on a spectrum and I want to experience all of it rather than being limited to one or to a few. To summarize over 4yrs of the constant internal philosophical turbulence I've put myself through, I'll say this: I never know what I want. In high school, I loved classic literature and politics and economics and sociology and debate so I thought hey, law school maybe. Then I realized I loved microbiology and medicine so I thought hey, premed maybe. THEN I fucking realized idk how to pick between law and medicine so I jumped to literally THE the most general major: Business. Instead of ""exploring"" diff careers through the major, I feel like I'm even more trapped than before, distanced from true academic rigor and from tackling problems that actually matter to me. So, what do I do? I talk. I ask people what they do in fields I've never even considered, I learn about how they're changing the world so maybe one day I can figure out how I fit into it too. My mom always told me I'd find my purpose if I gave myself the chance to explore - but the more I find out the more I want to know everything about everything and the more it frustrates me that we're all here for a finite time and most careers have a specific trajectory to follow with PhDs and years of experience, so I can't just ""dabble"" in it and leave.
So there. Maybe I'm just a dilettante. I can't pick a favorite food, a favorite subject, a favorite activity, can't choose whether socialism or capitalism is more realistic/better, can't take a stance on anything political because I just dont KNOW for a fact what's best for society at large... I used to care an insane amount about people and think a lot which drove me to what i think might've been depression for a couple years and now I don't feel anything other than surface happiness and appreciation for the amazing people I consider so so close to me. This ""confession"" right here is the first time I've let myself think all these thoughts since a solid few years. It's the only way I was able to focus enough on my current career without taking a step back and realizing I'm just another cog in the machine. Where is my balance? How do I find it? It's crazy to think that with the privileged life I've been given (a physical home + access to support), I now have a prestigious career planned which I've worked tirelessly for since I've gotten to Cal. And YET!! I still don't know basic shit like if I fucking want to date guys or girls or both, if I want to be a speech pathologist in my small hometown or an MBB consultant or a sailing instructor or a journalist or an aquarium attendant. It all just seems so new, so important. But the more I think, the less I focus on becoming an expert in what I HAVE chosen to pursue at least for now.
It's an incredible privilege to be at Berkeley and have the opportunity to learn from people at the forefront of research in their respective subjects like the humanities. And it's a privilege to sometimes do badly in (STEM) classes that open my mind up in ways I didn't think were possible before. But it's also the greatest burden to try and figure out how I will navigate the next 75 or so years of my life when I can't even find a balance between what I want to do, who I want to love, and how I want to find happiness in this world beyond the simple things I already do.
I guess being able to do it all is just too much to ask of myself, or anyone for that matter. If you read until here, thanks for listening :) If you've read Plato's Allegory of the Cave, here's a comparison for ya: Once I've seen the sun, how the hell can I turn my back and continue watching the shadows?

For example, the campus REFUSES to use proper disinfectant to clean toilet seats, because ""it's not green"" and because disinfectant makes the seats too sticky for people's liking. Another horror story is that before the microchillers are rented out to freshman in dorms, they are NOT properly cleaned. For example, some of them smell like puke because the drip trays weren't cleaned. In fact there was recently a roach problem in one of the units because a microchiller was near a radiator and roaches just spilled out into them. And then there's the filters for water fountains. When the filter light starts blinking on hydration stations (for your water bottle), the technician comes in and resets the light WITHOUT actually changing the filter.
Now that we're all away from campus, take this opportunity to drink ACTUALLY filtered water, and use ACTUALLY clean fridge and sit on ACTUALLY clean toilets.

A while back I remember reading about how a girl felt insecure about her physical appearance because guys would seem bored when talking to her, but would seem so interested in talking to a girl that they are attracted to. It’s possible that the guys could have been the perfect match for the girl in terms of personality, but the opportunity was closed because they didn’t feel the initial pull / interest.
It’s naive to think that things like physical appearance and popularity/social clout don’t matter. People don’t want to feel shallow but it’s just human nature to filter out those who don’t initially interest us. Sometimes we’re stuck with people by chance (such as being in the same class) who we initially weren’t interested in socializing with, but grew to appreciate and like them over time. Some of your closest friendships were enabled because of being in the right place and time. If history was different and just one or two factors were changed, the snowball effect may have never happened and the two of you could’ve been strangers. Imagine if your best friend right now actually lived somewhere really far away and you never met them, and you only had one day to meet them as a person. Do you think that one day is enough to fully know the depth of that person’s qualities? It’s even possible that you might not even completely like each other at first just by chance.
I don’t want to sound like a bitter woman who blames philosophical determinism, but there’s a kernel of truth in that some things are beyond our control.","5702.

2639694756306946,"5666. CW: brief mention of depression, anxiety, symptoms of eating disorders, and suicidal thoughts.
After all of the Coronavirus thing happening, my parents expressed concern about me staying in Berkeley by myself. My sibling who lives in SF told me that she could either visit me or I could spend the remainder of my semester with them.
I was already dreading the cancellation of everything and dreading the idea of going home to be with my parents.
My entire life before college has been nothing but trauma and depressing moments. I never believed that I had a positive relationship with my parents. We moved from Asia over a decade ago, and all I felt was to make sure I did everything to make my parents’ decision to move to America was worth it. I had no choice but to get good grades and excel in everything I did. I couldn’t hang with friends outside of class because it would stray me away from studying and getting their A+s. Not mine, theirs. I desperately wanted to do gymnastics and join Girl Scouts but I couldn’t because we didn’t have enough money and couldn’t afford to go to a hospital in case I broke a bone or got sick.
All this time, I thought it was the right thing for me to do. I socially isolated myself because my parents said it was the best thing for me at the time. I ate less food so I would look skinny since “no boy would ever like me if I were chubby.” I hated myself and never appreciated myself. I started to think about suicide since 6th grade because I didn’t think it was worth it to live if I couldn’t do things I wanted to.
But when I came to college, I felt so free. Not because of the freedom, but physically I felt like my heart was pounding louder and my shoulders felt so light and my face was always smiling. But it took me at least 2 years to realize that my past was still a part of me and I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety and major depressive disorder. I was thankful to be able to get therapy and professional help, but it made me realize that my current self was shaped due to my past.
A home has no connotation to me. And I frankly can’t get the guts to tell my parents that I’d rather be alone in my room in Berkeley than be with family because they trigger all of my past traumas no matter how much therapy and help I’ve received. My sibling called me selfish because I told them that I didn’t want to go to SF to be with them. They told me that I wasn’t thinking about family and how rude and disrespectful it was to leave my family worry about me as I was in my comfortable place in my own room.
Please, I don’t want to hurt them but I don’t know how to tell them that they hurt me if I have to do things they want me to do. Please let me be, and please allow me to be alone in this mass pandemic. I don’t want to hurt them or pass on this deadly flu. Please, for the best of both sides, leave me be.

2634130326863389,"5611. I struggle to express why Sanders makes me nervous but I'm gonna try…(FYI I'd back him over Biden any day)
It's just really concerning to me that he is probably one of the most if not the most polarizing candidate in the entire race. Democratic voters either swear by him or want to do anything to stop from getting the nomination.
I'm not fully blaming Bernie Sanders himself for this. I personally have a lot of respect for that man. It takes a rare person to be in politics for as long as he has and remain, for the most part, as consistent as he has been with his messaging. And to me, his policy proposals are very attractive. I've come around a lot on Medicare For All since he started campaigning on it, and I really like what he says about the wealth gap and corporate influence.
I think it's more the movement that he has inspired that makes me uncomfortable. More and more, the progressive wing of the party that supports him have been, to quote Pete Buttigieg (at the risk of sounding like I supported him, which I didn't), ""my way or the highway"" about it all with anyone seen as not progressive as them being placed on the chopping block. In that regard more than anything, Sanders resembles a left-wing Trump. I hate sounding like I'm viewing Sanders supporters as a monolith here because obviously they're not, but I can't really find a more delicate way to put it. Of course there's a big difference between Sanders and Trump: Trump's populism consists of baseless fear-mongering and bigotry, whereas Sanders actually speaks on real issues.
I know radical change is necessary. Sanders's vision is probably the best to implement to take care of the crises we face. However, when change is viewed that radically by the mainstream, it's incumbent on the radical to change that view. And Sanders is struggling here. That I think is a problem more with media coverage and portrayal than it is with Sanders himself. He is contending with media and a party establishment that are, for the most part, refusing to budge, so it's probably next to impossible for him to not be viewed as a radical, and it's profoundly difficult for him to make that case to a voter who, like many people, gets his/her/their news from media who consistently paints him as a radical no matter what. (And again, I have profound respect for Sanders for trying even when it can sometimes seem impossible for him to get it right.)
This is where I return to his base: It is highly incumbent on those who support his views to help him persuade others to adopt them. And while I'm sure that is happening, those reasonable voices are being dwarfed by much louder, angrier ones, at least in my internet experience. Those voices vilify anyone seen as too moderate, and that ends up alienating those moderates from Sanders's message, making them less likely to be persuaded even by a more logical voice who simply wants to lay down the numbers for Medicare For All because the moderates are just too irritated by the rowdy crowd.
And when moderates are repelled like that, Sanders has to turn to his campaign strategy of calling on a massive swell of progressive voters, mostly youth, to carry him to victory with sheer numbers, which, if Super Tuesday is indicative of anything, isn't happening. That's why Sanders is furiously campaigning in Michigan right now courting moderates, and my fear is that it's too late for him and that Biden will end up winning. And even if he does win, he and his base will have to continue courting moderates in the general election to avoid pushing them into just sitting out the election. And if he wins the presidency, he then has to work with a Congress that will, in all likelihood, be less progressive than him. And even if compromise is something Sanders can sit with, I don't think his loud base is.
Basically, to the Sanders supporters speaking out in anger and passive-aggressive shaming: be careful. Anger at institutional failures, systemic problems, and just plain nasty actions by people who betray the values of this nation is obviously fine. I share it. But aimless fury directed at or haphazardly thrown towards people whom you'll eventually need to persuade to your side, however, will doom you.","5611.

For some background, I believe that to make a social club successful, the leaders of that club must be proactive in building a community/making sure that the members/new comers are comfortable and feel included. Or another way to put it, it's to become friends with the people who are under you.
But in doing this, you lose a lot of your authority, because now the officers / members see you more as a friend and less as a leader. When you make decisions that some members dislike (often because it conflicts with their personal interests), they are more likely to be openly argumentative with you and attempt to influence you to make a different decision. I know that in the past when I was an officer and I wasn't very close with an exec, I would have never thought about messaging them to argue about a decision that they made. And if you stand your ground and explain your reasoning, sometimes they will become offended and angry, damaging your friendship with them.
This is especially evident when you have to enforce consequences or make sure that the officers fulfill their obligations to the club (such as tabling, fundraising, attendance, assignments, etc). At that point, it becomes a decision of:
1) enforce the punishment and risk damaging the friendship or
2) Don't enforce it and watch your authority disappear.
It feels like every decision that I make right now has the potential to blow up - I never know who it's going to become offended. You chose groups based on how well you believed that those individuals will vibe together rather than random generation?

This is outrageous because ""I already set up a time on that day to table"". Well I can't just let you off - how would that be fair for the other people? It often feels like when you make a decision to benefit one party, another is negatively impacted.
I'm not saying that the leadership is always right - in fact, sometimes our decisions can be arbitrary and the results sub-optimal. However, I feel like it's disrespectful to question a decision, receive an explanation for the reasoning behind the decision, and then continue to argue/give attitude. Especially since we have a anonymous feedback form. Or maybe I'm way too sensitive and this is normal and expected behavior that I'm misinterpreting as officers overstepping their bounds.

I understand that housing prices are sky-high, but if you hold unauthorized strikes and treat undergraduate grades as hostage, you deserve to be fired.
You knew what you were getting into when you joined the school. You knew the pay grades (they are publicly available online), and you knew the housing price. If you couldn’t afford it, and were not smart enough to get a full ride, why not just choose a different school? Maybe in a cheaper place, like Texas or Pennsylvania? Your lack of preparedness does not constitute as an emergency on the UC’s part.
I read the article in LA times in which a grad student might lose his paternity leave as he’s no longer eligible to be a TA. Well, guess what? He should’ve thought it over before. He should have considered how his withholding grades would affect his family. No sympathies there.
Students are talking about how the UC does not care about your education. However, it’s your stupidity which is costing you, not the UC.","5561. I’m a GSI, and I think that the strike going on right now is bullshit.

2630675790542176,"5556. I have a roommate who hits the gym occasionally, but definitely more than I do. He's what us gym veterans call, a gym newbie. Typical of all gym newbies, he works out upper body and neglects his lower body. He checks himself out in the mirror often, asks my friends if he looks bigger (while flexing his biceps), takes my digital weight scale to check if he put on a few pounds because, ""apparently"" bulking only takes a weeks to develop muscle mass. One day I went to the gym with him, and to my surprise, he was doing upper body again. I joined him to bench, then made my way to the squat rack thereafter. I should mention that I was an avid ""squatter"" (lol that sounds weird) in high school; watching YouTube videos on squat/bulking, improving ankle dorsiflexion, recording myself in the gym to criticized my technique, ate 3500 calories a day, you name it. My roommate sees me squatting and asks me to teach him. I proceed to teach him, very briefly, the basics of squatting, then he gets into the cage and ATTEMPTS the squat. Ohh maaaa Gaawwwddd was that the WORST squat form I've seen in my entire life. Not only was he doing it wrong, but he looked so uncomfortable; he did like 2 squats then called it, never to return again. This day confirmed to me, this fool doesn't know shit about working out, never read a book about it, any articles, watched any videos, and doesn't have the first clue on how to bulk (sorry buddy, eating two bowls of cereal instead of one is not bulking). I wanna help him cause that's my dawg but I'm not sure if I should. What should I do ???","5556. I have a roommate who hits the gym occasionally, but definitely more than I do.

She’s so sweet and funny and she bakes for us and is generally very helpful. I won’t miss 8am labs but I’ll miss you!
E. Too awkward to tell her in person, but Maggie Chang is one of the nicest and most approachable GSIs I've had. (also low key want her body and wish I could be her friend irl)
F. Oscar Syu, you are by far the greatest uGSI I have ever met. You have such a quirky personality, an empathetic mind, hard-wording spirit, and best of all — my personal favorite — a kind spirit. It was a sincere pleasure to have you as my uGSI for Data 8, and I do hope that you find pleasure in knowing that you were the singular light I found in gaining the motivation to finish my labs, homework’s, and projects. I always found that even in the days you seemed tired, you found some sort of energy to keep going. The days you breezed through material, but still took the time to clarify our questions. The days you came in with sweats, just to crack out a joke every now and then. I noticed a lot of your stress, and I apologize for not affirming you earlier, or even privately I would just like you to know that you are amazing.

It's vaguely depressing to spend 12+ hours in heeled booties and pants tight enough to restrict my walking speed, only to see most people wearing the same raggedy Cal sweatshirt and yoga pants every single day. I guess it makes me feel like a freak for even putting in the effort.
I realize this sounds way too judgmental, and I don't expect everyone to be into fashion. But I want to find a community. I'm not looking for designer clothes. I'm looking for wacky, brightly hued, I-bought-this-for-3-dollars-at-a--yard-sale clothes. I'm looking for people who wear what they want and don't give a fuck about my opinion.

When you first heard the news about the incident, you were devastated. You had stopped functioning completely and broke down as a person; that broke me. I wanted to do anything and everything I could to support you. I cared about (still do, and always will). Through it all, I did my best to support you through. It was during those times you were so honest and open. You shared so much with me. As time passed, I grew closer and closer to you without realizing it. We spoke everyday for hours and although seeing you in pain caused me pain, I was at least glad I was aware of everything.
But then, you cut me off. I have no idea what I did or said, but I must've upset you somehow. You just acted like you were fine and slowly pushed me away. You acted like you were fine, when you clearly weren't. I love you, do you realize what this did to me? I stopped eating and had to drink myself to sleep for several nights.
We've stopped talking for a while now, and if that's what you want, then I will respect that. I want you to be happy. But, why would you do this? Is their something that I did that was wrong? Or was it that I cared for you too much?

I'd like to tell any police officers who might be reading this that not all of us students at Berkeley are against you.
I agree with the sentiment behind the strike. I really do. But I don't understand why we need to trash on police officers so much (or even bring them into this conservation in the first place). The vast majority of law enforcement officers are people who are genuinely trying to make the world a better place. Without them, our city, our state, our nation as a whole would be a huge, anarchic mess.
Regarding the few bad apples, not every organization can be perfect, and some reform is needed. But to blindly trash on every single member of the police force is, IMO, unwarranted and vastly disrespectful.
I know I'm not alone in this sentiment. I just wanted to express my support for those who choose to go down a line of work where everyday they don't know if they will come back home. I respect you for the fact that even with so much unadulterated shit coming at you from a lot of people these days you still work so hard to protect us (including the people who are shitting on you). I respect and appreciate you for everything that you do.
Thanks for listening to my TED talk, and go do something nice for the next police officer you see!","5395. RE: the COLA strike at Croads today (2/21)

Every rational fiber of your being tells you that you don’t need this, so just ride it out. Feelings fade, just like everything in this world. The last thing you want or need is that kind of a relationship. It’s true that both of you are similar in many ways, but your differences would likely tear a long-term relationship apart. You adore how beautiful and good and full of life this person is, but at the same time, you are afraid to get closer to them, knowing they deserve better. After all, you understand that real love is not just based on feelings; you can love this person as a friend because ultimately, there’s no real reason to be more.
Yet, you’ve had feelings that have long surpassed the platonic level. These feelings have only gotten stronger over time, and you wonder if they’ll ever fade. Ever since you’ve felt this attraction, it seems as though you’ve never been at peace, always haunted by the possibility of something more--the flame that refuses to die.
Say there is a 1% chance this person feels the same way and that a worthwhile relationship results. Do you take a leap of faith and tell this person how you feel? Or do you take the route of 99% certainty, trusting that time will eventually do its thing?","5394. Suppose there is someone in your life who you are drawn to in a way that you do not understand.

Look: You're fine the way you are. In fact, you're exactly where you need to be in life. Don't let people tell you that you haven't tried, because you have. You're here, you're the person you've become, and there will be more days to grow and become even better. Everything you have ever felt or done or thought has been one of many natural human reactions to a chaotic reality. You are animal, you are human. And all the wisdom you've learned from life so far is continually growing and evolving.
You aren't supposed to bigger or smaller. You're the perfect size right now and you look exactly how you're supposed to look.
You're as wise, as good, as intrinsically valuable as you could ever be in this very instant.
Take a breath in and out. Be proud of who you are, whether or not you know what that means yet. Be proud of knowing that you aren't sure, because that's a part of who you are too, and that's something no one ever tells you when you're young. Sometimes selfhood is ambivalent. Sometimes you need to own your uncertainty. Just be proud that you are a living animal. Be proud of your living self. We have all made mistakes, and we will continue to make them, but it will all turn out alright in the end, because we'll make it alright.
It's okay to rest. It's okay to feel bad. Let the feelings come.
Your heart is good and large, and you must let it grow in feeling love and hurt and more love and more hurt. Because there's always more beauty where that came from.
I love you, because I know that if you are comprehending the words I'm writing right now, that means that you are realizing that you are alive, and I recognize that unique sentience in you. Hold onto that warm center of yourself.
Have a good life, and remember that it's a life that belongs to you.

- a submission we recently received
This is Spencer speaking - I wanted to address this issue. For the sake of full disclosure, I am also a paid leadership member of the Berkeley RHA and have been for the entire time I've been admin. I really enjoy both these organizations, but I do try my best not to be biased towards them when I'm doing the job of selecting submissions to be posted. This page posts both negative and positive comments about various student orgs, and I hold the opinion that no org is above being criticized. While I have promoted the RHA and the Daily Cal on Overheard and Confessions, there is a clear distinction between promotional posts and user-submitted content, and I have also promoted other campus orgs at their request.
Now, you may have noticed that we have never posted a negative confession about the RHA. The reason for that is simple: we haven't gotten a single confession about the RHA, period. I am aware that this could be because members of the RHA know I am admin and (incorrectly) assume that I would simply censor any such criticism. I wish I had a chance to prove my lack of bias, but in the end, as with all issues, I can only work with what the submitters give me. But I want everyone, both within my organizations and otherwise, to know that I am committed to selecting confessions without bias, as much as is humanly possible. The statistics say that most of you trust the page when we say that the submissions are truly anonymous. Won't you trust my integrity on this issue as well?
Another salient point is that, for the last three and a half weeks, almost all confessions were scheduled by my new moderators: Alex Chen, Bobathy Boba, Sankalp Sharma and Tessalou Valera. It won't be long before they I graduate and they do all the scheduling!

I don’t consider myself physically unattractive, in fact I’d like to think im a solid 7.5 and possibly an 8.5 with makeup/hair/nice clothes. I have a nice waist to hip ratio (and a pretty nice butt) and im a Latina. I understand that everyone has a “type” and that sometimes its not personal. However, my point is that my entire life, blonde/white women have always been considered more attractive than me. And I’ll give credit where credit is due: the majority of the white women at Cal are like 9.5-10’s ! Waaaay better looking than me. However, the experience that really fucked with me was when i was seeing this guy (he was white) and i mentioned that I’m Mexican. He responded by saying that his mom told him as a kid that mexicans are dark and dirty but that he’s “not like them at all”. Needless to say, I did not go on a second date and I felt really insecure about myself.
Recently, at work, my male coworkers had no interest in keeping up a conversation with me, despite the fact that i just wanted to kill time because we had nothing to do. I understand, since men seem to be less talkative than women so i don’t bug them with more awkward conversations. All of a sudden a pretty blonde girl walks up and they can’t stop talking to her! Im not even attracted to these guys and I’m in a loving relationship but the fact that they didn’t even want to make small talk with a friggin coworker (me) because they’re not as attracted to me as they are to a pretty blonde girl really irks me! And in my home town, a girl could be homely as fuck but just because she is white with blue eyes, EVERY guy says she’s insanely hot! For reference, most people in my hometown are Latino/as so I understand that colorism is partly to blame here. I know its not women’s fault and it’s really society’s fault. Point is: when you’re constantly told that you’re not as beautiful as someone else because you’re not white, it really fucks with your self esteem. And if you believe that white people are “just better looking than other people genetically” than THAT, my friend, is a little racist.","5314.

2606831316259957,"5278. Yesterday I saw something that truly broke my heart. It was about half past midnight and I was eating some pizza at Seniore's on Durant and looking out the window, when I saw an old white man slowly walk up to the trash can in front of the Karaoke bar. He looked skinny and a little weak and he walked roughly but otherwise he looked healthy. He proceeded to dig through the trashcan and pull out a disposable cup, and then drink from it. Then he pulled out what looked like a half eaten piece of pizza and started taking a few bites. I was crushed by the fact that this man, in his old age, has so little money that he has to eat the scraps that other people have thrown away, which are probably coated by a lot of bacteria and/or mold. I wondered how it is that he survives day to day and imagined that he probably struggles to find a place to sleep at night. I racked my brain to think of what I could do for him, but the best I thought of was to give him some money. Although I did this, I am forced to wonder how long this man will last and what will become of him. How tragic it is that some people live like this every day while the rest of us have more food and money than we know what to do with. I was reminded of this quote from CS Lewis's book Mere Christianity:
“If individuals live only seventy years, then a state, or a nation, or a civilisation, which may last for a thousand years, is more important than an individual. But if Christianity is true, then the individual is not only more important but incomparably more important, for he is everlasting and the life of a state or a civilisation, compared with his, is only a moment.”
Remember that humans are eternal creatures and all of them are infinitely precious. Even people that live on the streets and eat garbage are just as valuable as you and me. I wish I had more love for those people that I regularly try to ignore as I make my way around Berkeley every day.","5278. Yesterday I saw something that truly broke my heart.

I have had amazing moments with friends, and I've also had my fair share of terrible moments. But this is what makes life so fucking beautiful. My friends believe that I am a strong person, and maybe I am. In a circle of friends, there's that one person where everybody goes to vent, get emotional support, and life/romance advice; I am that person. Sometimes, I am just casually hanging out with my closer friends, and out of nowhere, they start venting heavy stuff to me. My friends are fucking amazing, and so many times, I've seen them get fucked over by people. I've seen my friends cry and struggle through hardships, and I know they deserve better. I love my friends, but recently, I feel like all of the emotional stress have been adding up and it's getting into me.
I believe that true friendships require unconditional love, and that I shouldn't be feeling bad when my friends don't do as much as I do for them. But lately, I have been feeling and thinking that my friends do not appreciate me enough. Or they don't care as much. I feel like my friends don't check up on me regularly. Sometimes, they check up on me, and when I start venting, slowly but surely, it always drifts into them venting. Or most of the time, I feel like I just get toxic positivity from them because they think I can handle emotional stress well. I have also been noticing that sometimes, they really only hangout with me when it's convenient. I feel like they never really go out of their way when it comes to me, but they do when it comes to our other friends. I feel like I really be doing the most for people who doesn't do as much. Most likely, these thoughts and emotions are probably just the product of my unstable mental and emotional state. Nevertheless, make sure to check up on the moms and dads of your circles, they probably have a lot of shit going on too.","5268.

I told her somewhat passively but made it obvious that it's not okay for her to be there because she's not in any of the org's affiliated with the reserved space (since we share with another org) and she still fucking sat down and acted like I didn't even speak to her. Maybe I sound like a selfish asshole so feel free to let me know. Either way, I feel like if you know that a space isn't yours and you encroach on it just because you need to study, your need to study doesn't justify what you're doing. Lots of other people on this campus don't have to resort to stealing cubicles in esh so why can't y'all be adults and do the same? And to the girl I'm talking about, just know that next time I will kick your ass out of the cubicle if I find you there again.",,1582565452,,,34,34,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2605057156437373&id=2156420374634389,

2595258690750553,"5144. The California Burrito from La Burrita (Southside) is the glue that holds together my destroyed psyche and withering body. There is nothing more important in life than the California Burrito from La Burrita (Southside), and that is an unarguable fact. It may even be a law of nature. I do not pretend to understand the inner machinations of the California Burrito from La Burrita (Southside) because to do so would be a true sin. Possibly the worst sin of them all.
This delectable California Burrito from La Burrita (Southside) is comprised of the most daring, most gorgeous combination of ingredients. Traditionally, the meat used is smoky, salty Carne Asada; you may instead opt for chicken, but if you do that I think you’re fucking stupid. Alongside the tender meat lay French fries that feel as if they were cut from the most voluptuous cumulus clouds in the sky. These two ingredients, partners for their loving albeit short lives, are envelopes in the loving embrace of salsa and guacamole. However, their clutch of passion is naught but a caress compared to the comforter of melted cheese that directly follows. All of these actors finally approach their curtain all, where the curtain is a warm, velvety flour tortilla.
You may ask why I must distinguish La Burrita as its Southside location. That is because the Northside La Burrita makes shitty California Burritos. It is without question that Southern California makes better California burritos, however I can only imagine these evangelical counterparts, as I am from the Bay Area and geographically cannot reach them. Nonetheless, in my slumbers, I know my heart reaches in yearning toward Southern California, and my emotions astral project so that I may spiritually lay in the sunny sand, with a SoCal California Burrito nested in my arm, as if it were my firstborn babe. I actually think I would be holding the Burrito with more care than I would a human child. Fuck them kids
I don’t think I could have lasted pst my first semester at Cal without the California Burrito from La Burrita (Southside). I think I would rather be dead in a ditch than event THINK about attempting to graduate this wretched god-forsaken school without it.
That raises an important question: Why do we exist? Just to suffer? I have asked myself this many times. The answer may be yes, but the blow of life’s adversities is softened by the California Burrito. Southside.","5144.

Her laugh is contagious, and seeing her on campus always puts a smile on my face. She is incredibly intelligent and well-spoken, and her accomplishments are outstanding. I think the most impressive thing about her is her humbleness and how approachable she is. I wanted to personally thank you for being there for me, and for always listening and being a resource. You only hear the best things about her from other people, and seeing the work that she does and knowing her experiences, I know that I put my trust in the right person to make change on the campus. Nicole, you inspire me. I hope you know that I, and probably many others look up to you. Keep up the amazing work!
C. Im a junior and I went to the SLC for the first time. But then I saw this cute girl tutoring for math. I was there for econ but I really wanted to talk to her so I pretended I need help with ""math"".
I came to her math table and asked how to do the derivative of some shit. I clearly knew how to do it but I wanted to somehow spark a conversation. The table probably though I was dumb as hell but who cares! I SAW HER NAME TAG. my goal was accomplished. I got to talk to her and I got her name off her name tag.
But CHRISTINE CHOW you are gorgeous. I found your Facebook but I am too scared to add you. You motivate me to come to the SLC. Maybe ill finally getting an A in one of my classes for going lol
D. Nicholas Stevens is the cutest nerd I have ever laid eyes on. I know that cal was my dream school but hot damn am I the luckiest duck to have found my dream boi here too.
E. Jacob Fisher is such a bright ball of sunshine in my life. Thank you for being a wonderful human and a fantastic pal.
F. I am so happy for my friend Daniel Lin for finally getting a job offer at a top tier firm! I know these past few months for him have been rough but me and my friends are so excited for him!!
G. The best GSI hands down from my 70 and 170 class has to be Vishnu Iyer. He is able to explain things very well and acknowledges his mistakes with his smarties idea.

This last semester was rough and even though a couple of months have passed, the pain is still there. His harsh words calling you worthless, disgusting, stupid, selfish, a waste of space, and so on... his way of looking down at you, holding his head high and mighty, watching you shrink away into the corner... his friends making side comments and judgmental looks, eyeing you up and down... the what if’s that blame you for being a bad girlfriend/friend/human being that never seem to leave you alone... his actions currently-following you around, convincing your friends not to talk to you, getting wasted and shit talking you to random strangers.

2593744660901956,"5129. This past friday, I lost my virginity with my chem 1a lab partner. And oh my god, it was the sexiest moments of my life.

He was a super tall guy, with shoulders that were shaped like boulders. His biceps were busting out of his short sleeve abercrombie shirt, threatening to rip the shirt at any moment. His jaw was almost like a diamond, just like super man. His eyes meant mine, and I swear I could just have stared into them forever.
""Wanna be partners?"" he said. Suddenly I felt entirely wet. Did he just ask me if I want to be like, in a relationship? or like lab partners?
""you bet!"" I said. I walked over to him and sat down on the stool next to him. We both put on protective eye wear and got to work. As we wen't through each and every step in the experiment, I could feel my pussy throbbing everytime his huge muscular arms got even close. He had veins running down his forearm, and huge hands. Then , when we were almost done a few hours later, and I saw IT. Oh my god. I have never seen anything like it. He was probably only semi hard but it looked like a snake was trying to bust out of his pants. Holy shit. I could see the outline of the enormous head, it was nearly as big as an apple.
""Hey, wanna chill back at my place? It's right above foothill. I asked the GSI, he said he'll finish up the experiment for us since we finished all the questions.""
Together, we had a short walk to his apartment. and the moment he closed the door, he pulled down his pants, and oohhhhh my gooodness. I have never seen a cock so big and huge. In fact I had no clue a penis could get so big. The head was bigger than an apple, and his shaft was at least 16 inches long. I put one hand on it and began to stroke it.
The most amazing feeling ever was that, because of his immense size, I could feel the blood pumping into his cock. It was unbelievable that such a big dick was getting bigger and bigger. I could literally feel his masculinity and power pouring into his rod.
I will leave out the juicy details so this gets posted, but basically I couldn't walk the next day, he had to carry me to my classes.","5129. This past friday, I lost my virginity with my chem 1a lab partner. And oh my god, it was the sexiest moments of my life.

Everyone says that majoring in history or english means not finding a job and they kind of have the reputation of being useless. So I tried really hard to build on my humanities passion and find something more modern, more practical. I ended up doing an interdisciplinary social science major (I know, also hard to find a job with)... and I hate it. My major advisors have been incredibly unhelpful, the curriculum is nonsensical and fails to engage with what it claims to educate you in. I've gotten far more out of my minor than I have from my major. I just feel so, so stupid. I had an INCREDIBLE opportunity to go to UC Berkeley and I ended up wasting my own time, my parents money, and the resources of this institution. I cringe every time someone asks me what my major is because I'm so embarrassed to study something I'm not passionate about. I have to fake it every time and act like I enjoy it because I don't want to divulge to every person how big of a mistake I made. The worst part is, I really want to go to graduate school for something completely different, and I worry that I'll never get into the programs I want to attend all because I was a dumbass and rushed into a major without thinking twice about what I really loved.

I remember in middle school (and high school, and I guess even now for some people) when most of us thought that cutting was for the suicidals and the attention seekers. It's been almost a year since I started. See, it was never about offing myself of gaining sympathy. For me, it was about feeling so empty and so hollow and so numb that I needed the emotions to manifest into something physical.
Relatively speaking, I'm in a better place now. I've been seeing my therapist for nine months now and I've been on antidepressants for more or less five months. But I've never quite gotten over hurting myself. Every time I get really sad over something or upset with someone, I still pick up that safety pin and briskly brush it onto my wrist until the white scratch marks turn bright red and until the bright red scratch marks start drawing blood.
I don't really know where I'm going with this confession and I'm not really sure what I'm trying to get out of it. All I know is that, for someone who has always presented a strong and confident and headstrong exterior, I've never felt so ashamed. I'm ashamed of my inability to cope with sadness and anger and frustration through something more constructive and healthy. I'm ashamed that my best friend saw the cuts and scabs seven months ago. I'm ashamed that I made him look at me with so much pity and concern in his eyes when I tried to brush it aside. I'm ashamed of the fact that I can't even schedule lab appointments for blood tests because I'm scared that they'll see what I've done to myself when they roll up my sleeves. I'm so ashamed of it all that I can't even openly talk to my therapist about this.

Going to Berkeley has made me not a fool, so how does one then interact with the fools?",,1580961600,,,132,10,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2588544174755338&id=2156420374634389,

A. Dan Ma is one of the absolute sweetest humans on this campus, thank you for being a friend I can always count on
B. Kaitlyn Chan is a super awesome lab assistant and has single handedly transformed my 16b experience from a hellish experience to a slightly less hellish experience.
Thanks Kaitlyn!
C. Ben Satzman is so sweet and gentle. His mannerisms are adorable and I love his sense of style. Whenever I see him it brightens my day!
D. Alexia Armstrong is the most beautiful individual, every time I see you my heart flutters. The way you laugh at your own dad jokes is the cutest thing.
E. Savinnie Ho is such a kind and sweet person, I just see her smiling around campus and it makes my day :)
F. I think Ovya G. is a pretty interesting person for no particular reason at all. Kinda wish we could talk more but I legitimately have nothing interesting to say lmao

This girl is gorgeous, smart, kind to me, and really everything I could ask for. Perfection. She's completely out of my league, and I'm honestly still quite confused as to why she wants to date me. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy it happened, but there's an unshakeable thought in the back of my head that she's going to realize she can do better (from what I know, she has done better, in terms of men at Cal) and break up with me. I've grown pretty attached to her and would be devastated if this happened.
She's never said anything to make me feel bad about myself, but my friends constantly crack jokes about how out of my league she is, and it's getting to my head. I've seen her friends make fun of her for dating me too. It's kind of sick.

2587888938154195,"5056. My first semester of college I was in a philosophy class, and near the end of the semester this guy said something about ""trying not to fall in love with every girl with a pretty smile,"" and then he made shy eye contact with me. Guess what? I only now JUST realized he was most likely talking about me! That was ten years ago! I'm almost 30, for the love of god!
I swear...if I'm not the most interpersonally-foolish fool that ever fooled!!! With shockingly low self-esteem, romance-wise. But the REAL problem is that my depersonalization disorder doesn't allow for me to be in the room with myself, let alone the object of someone's affections. I'm still trying to include ""being a person who is loved"" into my personal narrative and it feels impossible--just to feel loved. Love feels so rarified to me, especially for myself. I keep trying to convince myself that I am the protagonist to my own life, and sometimes I think it's never going to actually work. I'll APPARENTLY have nothing to do with it.
All through winter break, I've just been realizing how many guys have actually liked me, or even loved me. I have been loved. My ex boyfriend loved me, and I wouldn't accept it. I still can't believe he did. I know it in my head, but not my heart. My heart tells me all the time that I'm unloveable. I must have hurt so many people by assuming that I'm forgettable and insignificant, and that's the worst part about it. I've neglected relationships based on confidently taking it for granted that no one will remember me when I leave the room. I never, ever want to hurt anyone in any way. But I know I have, and I was in denial about that.
The cognitive dissonance required for this level of unconscious assumption is really mind-boggling!
One of the big downsides to this is that I can't jokingly say, ""Don't go falling in love with me now,"" because I might never know if they actually are in love with me and that I'm hurting them and accidentally mocking their emotions.
I don't comprehend myself.","5056.

I know that an ideal, wholesome person would congratulate or reassure them in these cases, but this school has beaten my spirits and confidence in my own abilites so much that seeing somebody who still retains these is almost frustrating.

I graduate and we finally meet and he's not that tall or strikingly handsome but like clean cut and stuff.

2586309844978771,"5033. I get so ridiculously sad about dating sometimes. The thing is, so many men say they're fun and funny, but their repartee or whatever is boring and...usually borrowed. And even people in general (but most often men) don't care to even try to be legitimately charming. Their concept of ""charming"" is also borrowed. And therefore they aren't charming, exactly because they haven't given thought to what ""charming"" even means.
To be charming is not about impressing someone or imitating certain behaviors in order to entirely copy someone else's ""successful"" personality; it's about trusting yourself to use YOUR innate personality to make people COMFORTABLE, make people feel WANTED, and feel appreciated as an INDIVIDUAL person, not just as a conceptual prototype of womanhood that they borrowed from television. It's depressing to be treated like nothing more than a replaceable prototype. I feel so unseen most of the time. And it's worse that I'm nonbinary, because I'm also misgendered in the bargain.
Like, first of all, I know SO many hilarious women. Second of all, I'm not a woman!!!!!
Authentic human connection is charm. Respect is charm. Kindness is charm. Honesty is charm.
Charm is a portable home. Charm is the fireplace where you warm your feet in the winter. Charm is good hospitality.
Men often haven't had to learn how to be hospitable. They have been trained, essentially, into a concept of charm that accomplishes and ""wins"", not one that ephemerally connects--without trophies. That's why so many men are so lonely and don't know why: they have not been taught the satisfaction of using the playground of ephemerality.
That's what comedy and improv is, that's repartee. That's charm.
I want legitimately charming banter with someone romantic and fun and giving who is my equal.

Men often haven't had to learn how to be hospitable. They have been trained, essentially, into a concept of charm that accomplishes and ""wins"", not one that ephemerally connects--without trophies. That's why so many men are so lonely and don't know why: they have not been taught the satisfaction of using the playground of ephemerality.
That's what comedy and improv is, that's repartee. That's charm.
I want legitimately charming banter with someone romantic and fun and giving who is my equal.

2585231878419901,"5026. It's recently been circulating that the EECS uGSI's ""won"" the grievance this past Monday. (link: http://uaw2865.org/cal-tas-win-multi-million-dollar-grievance-victory)
I'm sorry that I'm not strong enough to voice my opinions without the security of an anonymous confession, but I did want to note a few things that I think everyone should at least think about.
This decisions creates a financial burden to the EECS department, which already does not get sufficient funding from the UC Board of Regents. What does this affect?
8 hr TAs: This decision effectively kills any possibility of an 8hr TA. I really enjoyed the 8 hour role starting off since it let me balance my classes with teaching. Most 8 hour positions will help with grading, proctoring, and general class logistics, but their main focus is to use these hours to prepare the worksheet, teach, and learn from the feedback. Going into 15/20 hour positions, a lot of the time is delegated to the overwhelming logistical burden of running a 1000+ class (with the professor). With this decision, almost every class would need to move from some 8 hrs to none, preventing new TAs from growing as a TA first before getting bogged with the logistics and barring students who cannot make the 15/20 time commitment but are still interested in teaching from teaching. to this semester's 8hrs, i think this chain of messages would be interesting to read: https://mobile.twitter.com/BerkeleyUAW2865/status/1217237669282865152
Class Size: With this decision, classes would not be able to hire as many TAs as they did before. To prevent an absurd TA to Student ratio, the enrollment cap would need to be lowered. Some classes fill up before your phase 1 even starts; this problem would just get worse.
GPA cutoff: The cutoff to declare CS is absurdly high. To let students graduate in 4 years, the cutoff would potentially rise just to make sure students who do declare can take the classes they need, disregarding any classes they are interested in o passionate about.
I'm a TA who has the privilege of coming to Cal on a scholarship, having a work study, and holding other financially supportive positions, so this decision is definitely helpful at least in the near future, but I would put the chance to teach (as an 8hr) as well as the chance to learn (reduce class size) above this decision.
What now? EECS and CS are two of the largest majors at Cal. Many students in Cognitive Science take CS classes. Data Science just opened and are now the largest growing major. These financial restrictions prevent all of these students from taking classes they are interested in and pay the college to learn (my argument coming from the fact that these majors can have a heavy emphasis on CS courses as a base). If the union (or even you all) wants to make a win, get the Board of Regents to allocate a proportional amount of funding to the department as there are students interested in taking these courses.

God it was red hot passion while tasting chocolate fudge ice cream and tingling all over. Literally like 3 times a week in bed and straight to the shower in the morning on the weekends. And I felt it brought us closer too and made the snuggles that much more intimate. It was like half of the experience with her.
And now since she graduated and started her job, it's been totally different. The sex has slowed to a crawl and I am not trying to pressure her to do something she is not comfortable with but I just feel as if she doesn't find me attractive anymore. Maybe it is me selling out to software engineering like her (no longer following my exotic major) or me wearing the same clothes as when we hooked up or her new job that works her 60-80 hrs a week.
I still love her and it's clear she still loves me everytime we meet up but God it seems like there is more I can do to rekindle the passion. Perhaps I need to move closer as we were back then.
She also hardly replies to my texts anymore and doesn't pick up my calls very often, versus we would always text like 100 times a day and call every night.

I saw a dude sitting on the benches in the little octagonal grass lot in Foothill. It was nearing sunset. Normally, it’s someone talking on their phone, and it was an acquaintance-of-an-acquaintance Facetiming his mom. I thought he was talking to a girl sitting nearby, so I planned to walk past them and eavesdrop, but he was crying, and I wanted to make sure he was ok. He saw me sit on the same bench, talked to his mom for another minute, and hung up. Then, we talked. Frankly, I don’t remember what we talked about. I do remember that the sun set, it got colder, and we kept talking. I do remember waiting for the deer to come out and graze on the grass lot, like they sometimes do at night. I do remember that while the first week felt like lonely hell, he gave me the feeling of a meaningful friend. I also remember the hug I gave him. It was so...warm. Sometimes, I’ll see him on campus, and our eyes will meet, for the briefest period, and then we’ll go on about our lives. I think about him occasionally. In some alternate universe, we are best friends. In this one, we are half-strangers, with a golden memory no one knows about, buried deep inside two prefrontal cortexes, a treasure only we share.

I originally started out in EECS too, but then I switched cause it was just too fucking much for me. But now I don't know what to do. I don't want to do CS. I dread taking another CS class. I don't even have a minor, and I can't stand taking another CS class, so I don't even see myself going into industry. I could go to grad school and go into academia, but from all the people I've heard from, it's basically impossible. Seems like there are way more PhD's than tenure track positions, and I don't want to wither away in some useless adjunct position. Right now I feel like everything just seems hopeless. Maybe the only thing I can do is sacrifice some of the extra classes that I wanted to take and do a math minor. I guess I always liked math, and with math skills maybe I can be an accountant or something. But it just seems so bleak. I'm going to have to take 18-22 units a semester just to do this minor and complete my major. But even then, I don't know if I'll even enjoy doing some math related job.
Sometimes I wish I could've been passionate about EECS. Like I wish coding could give me lasting satisfaction and fulfillment.

I wish it was like in elementary school, where you'd ask someone, ""Do you want to be my friend?"" without sounding like a creep. Sometimes I feel like asking people that.
I'm the kind of person that when I see someone I love, I want to go running up to them and hug them. Kinda want someone to do that with, without making it seem weird. I'm the kind of person that likes to talk for hours and hours, sharing odd memories, exciting news, planned goals, and concerns. But, seems like no one has time to do that anymore. When I used to go with my CAPS psychologist, it always felt like I was talking to someone close to me. I would always hold myself back on asking her personal questions. We were once talking about my crush when I accidentally asked her about her crush. Thankfully she didn't hear me right and asked me to repeat what I had said. I ended up changing it to something else. I like interactions that consist of both parties. As much as I love talking about myself sometimes, it can get annoying to me. I want to hear about the other person.
If only people could stop taking advantage of me, and get to truly know me. And if only I can stop being so stupid, and stop letting people take advantage of me. sigh, I am too sweet to do much about it. Anyone want to be my friend?","4954. Here I am waiting for a friend.

The duality of this man’s bruised yet seemingly large ego, and his insecurities about being not as successful as me and my other friends just fueled the toxicity in our relationship. This boy would never take me out on dates or anything, and make excuses as to why not, but then would proceed to ask me for sexual favors, and said if I fulfilled them, which I never did, he’d take me out to dinner. Sir, I can buy my own motherfucking dinner. Maybe that’s why he ended things after promising he cared for me and just me, and didn’t care as much about physical stuff. He constantly pressured me to drink/smoke/have sex, and I never really had before and didn’t really want to, but when I’d refuse, he’d whine and make me feel guilty, and would romanticize all of the things that I just didn’t really feel like doing or just didn’t fit into my personality. He told his housemates I was a horrible gf, despite asking me to bring him food to his study sessions or bring him medicine or take care of him when he was depressed or drunk. He broke up with me over text, probably knowing I was gonna end it, and gave me no explanation except that he couldn't really stand a lot of the things I did (even though they were all for him). The worst part is, no matter what, I can’t help him see how much of a too-faced dick he is. My only wish is that he’d become more self- aware instead of putting down the people who care about him even if they are more motivated or passionate or successful. He has to cheat on all his exams to pass and then has the audacity to call me dumb behind my back (the audacity… I know). It truly baffles me that I almost fell in love with someone who only worked to reinforce and bring out my most negative thoughts and perceptions in this world. And the rare times he did say nice things, like that I'm intelligent and inspiring, he'd go and say the opposite to his friends and my friends, telling them I was too vapid to even have a real conversation with, despite the number of deep conversations we did have. I’m not even sad or upset but I’m just genuinely in shock at how I gave so much time and energy to someone who lied to my face every single day for an entire semester, and put me down behind my back, thinking his friends, who secretly resent him, wouldn’t tell me the things he said. I don’t know how to not feel anxious thinking about him, or hurt knowing our friendship and relationship was a lie. I want to feel okay again, I want to be able to trust people again, but right now, all I feel is uneasy, and regret that I let myself be manipulated like this.

2574666602809762,"4914. For all the horny posts on this page, I gotta say guys, I'm a little disappointed at the lack of femdom representation. I know that because of gender stereotypes, a significant number of people assume men should be the dominant one in the mild BDSM that has become commonplace, even though most people realize they're actually switches after trying both dom/sub roles. In my experience as a dominant female, most guys are down (if not EXTREMELY down) to be sexually submissive. Granted, that's a small pool of people and maybe I attract guys who enjoy that (I've found a very strong correlation between how tall a guy is and how much he enjoys being submissive, there's probably something psychological there, but that's another story). But also, I've recommended to many of my female friends that they try some mild domination on their boyfriends (with his consent of course) and WITHOUT FAIL those who try it come back and thank me-- they have a great time, their boy has a great time, but they just fell into the ""default"" roles and never tried it before. But they are hesitant about trying it and have a number of concerns (see Q&A below). So I'm saying, ladies, ask your man if he would be down to be dominated. And men, ask your ladies if they would be down to dominate you. You never know if you don't try.
Disclaimer: I'm mostly talking about mild BDSM that y'all do anyways. If you're interested in something more intense, I would recommend doing your research to make sure you are safe. Use that Berkeley Brain to conduct some in-depth analysis, I expect a 30-page report with an executive summary and at least 5 graphs. A powerpoint is not necessary but would be highly appreciated.
Frequently Asked Questions/Concerns:
1. Why are you writing this?
Great question! It is because I am thirsty. Also this advice has enriched many of my friends' sex lives and I wish to impart that same enjoyment onto you.
2. I feel self-conscious asking my boyfriend/hookup if he's down
That's okay, think about it for a while. Tag your boy in this and say ""what if we tried this...haha just kidding...unless?"" Realize that high risk comes with high reward. You can do it, sweaty.
3. My boy really enjoys being dominant so I don't think he would like this
You don't know unless you ask! Also, if he has never tried it before, he cannot know whether he would enjoy it.
4. I like my men big and strong, not submissive
That is not mutually exclusive! It can be even more enjoyable if he is assertive in the streets, submissive in the sheets. Also I'm mostly talking about mild BDSM-- try (consensually and safely) tying him down, blindfolding him, choking him, nothing that would necessarily mean he has to act in a ""meek"" way (of course there's nothing wrong with that, but that's a whole different kink).
5. WOMEN R SUPPOSED 2 BE SUBMISSIVE !! >:((((
lol nope
6. I am not interested in this
That's valid! To each their own. This is to meant to encourage those who think they may be.
7. Hur dur want some horny be gone pills?
Nope, I actually really enjoy being horny and am having a great time over here. Maybe if you were MORE horny you could come up with something funny and original, instead of a dead meme.
8. You must really like lists
Yes lists are my second favorite kink
P.S. To my friends- I know you know I wrote this, it is very obviously me, please don't tag me lol let's keep this anonymous","4914.

2573795956230160,"4909. This confession has big crackhead energy, but it’s something I needed to get out.
Have you ever been hit with “Oh.” during a text conversation? It stings. Something about the period intensifies the feeling, showing some feeling of utter disappointment or anger. It’s receiving this text that led me to discover something I plan to publish in a scientific journal in LaTeX™ one day: the Fundamental Theorem of Oh.
The theorem is predicated off of a realization: the word “Oh.” sounds like the letter “o”. Naturally, this means that you can substitute the letter “o” with “Oh.” in any word. For example, the word “Stop!” would become “StOh.p!”, the word “No” would become “NOh.”, and so on and so forth.
However, this creates an interesting phenomenon, because the word “Oh.” has an “o” inside of it, causing a recursive substitution. “O” becomes “Oh.”, which becomes “Oh.h.”, continuing until the inevitable entropic heat death of the universe.
This allows us to conclude:
O = Oh. = O(h.)^∞
I’m not very good at calculus, so there’s probably some limit or approaching infinity business somewhere.","4909. This confession has big crackhead energy, but it’s something I needed to get out.

2572985059644583,"4899. God damn. Nobody told me about Berkeley Goggles before I came to Cal and I’m fed up with the men looking like my 8 year old brother.
1) Clothes. Make sure your clothes fit you. It doesn't matter the style but nothing looks worse than someone who has clothes too small or too large for their bodily proportions.
2) Hair is insanely important. For gods sake, cut and style your hair. Get some gel and figure out the angles of your hair. Nothing is sexier than when a girl combs her hands through your hair and shivers go down your back. Personally I like when a guys hair is shorter on the sides and longer on top. The top should be long enough (like 1.5-2 in) so I can run my hands through it/ grab something while we make out. 1.5-2in should also allow men to be able to style it with gel to look put together.
3) Glasses (if you have them) Find frames that make your face look angular. Women drool over the angled jaw lines of celebrities, so find a pair that can emphasize either your cheekbones or your jawline.
4) Posture. Hold your shoulders back. This will open up your body and force your head to look up making you look more confident in your appearance and ultimately “sexier”

2572125136397242,"4885. Nobody has ever put me first.
I have never had a friend that has really wanted to hang out with me or just get to know me for who I am, not just for “networking”.
I always make an effort to be as attentive, loving, and friendly as possible, but I guess no one likes me enough to do the same for me. People always become my acquaintances, but then find their own circles and ditch me. They always leave, and I have learned to have little faith in others; naively trusting someone would just hurt me again.
I hate this life.
I wish I had someone to call when I was stressed, someone to share my thoughts with, and someone to rely on—someone to call my best friend or close friend.
I thought college would be different, but I was wrong. It seems everyone has already found their best friends.
I was planning on rooming with my closest college friend next year. He ditched me for his other friends, even though we hung out nearly every day and actually talked about deep shit together. We even talked about rooming, and we were so stoked to be together. In the end, he jumped at the opportunity to leave me. He even told me that his other friends were more well-connected and this would benefit him more, so he left me.
I am naturally introverted and it was really hard for me to put myself out there and try to grow closer to him... he was the first person I was vulnerable with; the first person I thought I could call my best friend.
I’m so fucking lonely, and I don’t even want a best friend. I just want a close friend. I just want to tell someone my stupid jokes, share my secrets with them, and relate to them on a deeper level than just saying hi or laughing at shit. I want a true friend... just one is all I ask for.
But, I don’t have anyone.
What’s wrong with me?? Is my personality just not good enough? I don’t want to change myself, so it looks like I’ll be stuck like this forever.

He has adorable thick and ruffle-y hair and hazel eyes and cherry lips, and he’s just such a cuuuuute boi. We were cuddling and we randomly made a new inside joke called Turtle Mode where he burritos himself in a blanket and peaks his head out halfway, only coming out just a little each time I feed him a goldfish. I stopped feeding him for just a minute as a tease and monched a buncha goldfish myself, and his normally calm and smiley and sweet face transformed into this jokey angery expression, and he held one of my fingers hostage until I fed him another goldfish XD
It’s not even just the superficial things. He somehow supports me through everything. He feels... he feels so surreal. I never thought I could have something like Us.
I’m tearing up a little honestly, and I’m not sure if it’s because I miss him already or because I’m so Happy or because I’m so scared of this happiness or what.

I did decently well to set myself up for mid-range grades in each of my classes across all our midterms, through hard work and grinding it out in the library consistently and efficiently.
Then, during dead week and finals week, I just completely lost all motivation to study. Couldn't get myself to go to study sessions or to do even a single practice test, nop. I literally sat in my room and played games, went to a friend's dorm, nap, socialize, whatever it was so I wouldn't have to study. Then when the wave of finals started to roll around, I did some last minute studying and pushed out some cheat sheets idiotically like a fart coming out unsure of whether to be speedy, smelly or noisy.
Now that I've finished finals and gone home, I don't even have a desire to relax and play games or watch TV shows. I've started pre-learning stuff for my classes next semester, reading interesting books, and started pursuing some hobbies that could actually be useful to me in the future. And not because I'm mad about failing finals, but just because I feel like it.

To all the ladies out there (I mean everyone else too but I'm just gonna focus on the ladies), I recently read an article that said that one of the problems women face in trying to get interviews/jobs is that women tend to only apply for positions where they feel almost 100% qualified whereas men are more likely to apply even if they didn't meet all the qualifications.
Now, I understand that this is very general and vague (it cited a study but I didn't check details/numbers) and the same can go for everyone else too, but I wanted to point it out specifically for the ladies who might be down after fall recruiting (for certain majors) or finals, because I know a lot of other girls who this does apply to. Shoot your shot (at a job)! You've got nothing to lose! And if they reject/ghost you, don't feel bad! They're missing out on you! And you can still reapply next year when your resume is even better than ever and then they might notice what they're missing out on! Let's cheer each other on!

2560565630886526,"4779. Before you read this, go tell an asexual friend you value their friendship :)
-a bear questioning sexuality at 3 in the morning instead of studying for finals
So I’m pretty sure I’m asexual, but it’s been quite the journey to come to that conclusion.
When I tell people I’m ace, nobody believes me. I’m usually met with “Really? Were you molested as a kid?” Or “You just aren’t ready yet” or “maybe try again with different people” or “that’s not normal”. While I don’t take a whole lot of offense from these comments (They do make me feel momentarily isolated, but I think that’s more a product of being asexual than that of insensitive comments), they have made me question if there is any validity to being asexual. I mean they aren’t baseless. I have fully functional human anatomy and am in good health. If the norm is defined as what most people feel and do then not wanting to have sex with people is definitely not normal.
So I began a journey to figure out what was wrong with me, if anything, taking each persons comments into careful consideration before coming to a conclusion for myself.
I looked into my past, mostly good memories, some trauma, none of it sexual though. I have had maybe two “crushes” in my 21 years of existence, but it was more like a, “I really want to be this persons best friend, but please don’t touch me thanks” kind of thing. Additionally, on numerous occasions, I have gotten very emotionally close with a friend of the opposite gender, but never, and I mean NEVER have I ever wanted to have sex with any of them. (Side note: it really doesn’t help that I like hanging out with my friends one at a time, you know, since it’s easier to get quality time and fully appreciate a friend and their presence that way. But whenever I do that, my other friends that see us hanging out, start shipping us (even tho They know I’m asexual) and bugging us about a nonexistent relationship sometimes to the point that the person I’m hanging out with starts questioning it (even tho I also told them I’m asexual) and it annoys me to no end...[deep inhale of repressed rage]..AnyWaY). Finally, in some relationships, I forced myself to reciprocate intimacy (for science, and maybe also because I wanted to be like everyone else), but I still felt no attraction, no desire for sex with those people even though I cared about them a lot. So, Some number of adventurous misadventures later, I think I can rule out having trauma from childhood molestation, not having found the right person, and not having tried hard enough.
That leaves not being ready. So, Maybe I’m a late bloomer. I have no way of telling if in the future my sex drive will suddenly awaken and ill finally be “normal” just like everybody else, although it is unlikely given that I’m at the age where my hormones should be in overdrive. That’s not impossible, but I’ve decided that that isn’t the point. I identify as asexual now, and whether or not that changes later shouldn’t affect what I feel Is the way I want to live my life now. Saying I’m Ace is (well is supposed to be) an easy way to explain why I am the way I am, so people stop trying to fix me or classify my actions under a sexual lens, when all I want is friendship, more people to add to my family.
Through all this, I finally understand why representation is so important. Having not known asexuality was a thing, I assumed everyone thought like me. I always thought people were exaggerating when they talk about their desire for sex with other people as a mark of masculinity or openness or some other positive social parameter. I put myself in some outright dangerous situations just because I thought everyone just wants friendship, and there’s no harm in being friends with anyone. I didn’t understand why coming out was such a big deal/why people seem so divided over sexuality/why the CUB page is 90% sex confessions when I felt like sex was such a small part of life. But I understand now more than ever why homophobic/acephobic comments and actions are so damaging and isolating. It blows my mind how different the world would be if I had interpreted everything I’ve ever experienced from a more sexual perspective.
So to my 10% of misinformed sexual people who mean no harm, I think a good starting point/a good rule of thumb is to remember if you wouldn’t say it to a gay person, you shouldn’t say it to an asexual person. For instance, you wouldn’t say to a gay person, “you once said this girl was hot so you aren’t actually gay”, so don’t say “you once said this sex related thing, so you aren’t actually asexual”. You wouldn’t say that a gay person is broken because they are gay so you also wouldn’t say that an asexual person is broken because they are asexual. One good thing about being asexual is that you see people as people before anything else, and we’d like to be treated as such.
And to my fellow asexuals, be confident in what you want (or rather, what you don’t want), remember only you get to decide how you live your life, treat your ace-misinformed friends with love and patience for they know not of what they speak, And blaze a path for future generations of people who just don’t want to have sex with other people <3","4779.

But, the one feeling I took away and was as stayed with me all day is I just missed be touched. I miss holding hands. I miss being held. I miss being kissed. I did not have sex with the mystery man, just kissed so I do not believe this is just a horny-be-gone situation. I just remember how good it felt in dream land to be held by this other person. And how passionately I wanted to be with them. And in the dream when my bc caught us, I didn’t care. I don’t know whether this is my subconscious telling me to breakup with my bf, whether I just miss him and physical affection, or whether this is just a dream where lots of other random shit happened that I can’t explain and I’m reading too much into it.

2550122315264191,"4672. Confessions of a toxic fuck.
I don't know how to not insult the fuck out of everyone around me. It's really bad. Not hard to figure out why, my parents were the typical roast the shit out of my for 18 years type of parents, which meant in high school, my friends were all roast-the-shit-out-of-each-other friends. There was no ""sacred ground"", I spent 6-7 years before college with people who thought it was totally fine to make fun of dead relatives or suicides or breakups, and were ok receiving those roasts too.
Anyways, I spent like a month earlier this semester trying really hard to tone back my external toxicity, but it just felt like I was internalizing it all, and it was super fucking bad for my mental health and I was losing motivation to study/work/exercise/fuck etc. Counseling is absolutely fucking useless (and I have been, many times), I don't need to have someone listen, I have plenty of people for that. And before any dipshit motherfuck one psychology class and I'm an expert tries to diagnose me, I'm not lonely, I'm not short, I'm not fat, I party every weekend and have great job prospects, a caring girlfriend who I love the shit out of, etc. I'm just... toxic, it's like addictive and it's really bad :/
It just feels really good to go full out nuclear on people sometimes and I haven't been able to find another outlet for what's inside me other than well crafted, artistically elegant roast. I feel this orgasmic satisfaction after I roast someone so bad they leave chat or drop off social media for a few days.
Maybe I'm asking for a non-destructive outlet for sadism?","4672. Confessions of a toxic fuck.

Anyways, I spent like a month earlier this semester trying really hard to tone back my external toxicity, but it just felt like I was internalizing it all, and it was super fucking bad for my mental health and I was losing motivation to study/work/exercise/fuck etc. Counseling is absolutely fucking useless (and I have been, many times), I don't need to have someone listen, I have plenty of people for that. And before any dipshit motherfuck one psychology class and I'm an expert tries to diagnose me, I'm not lonely, I'm not short, I'm not fat, I party every weekend and have great job prospects, a caring girlfriend who I love the shit out of, etc. I'm just... toxic, it's like addictive and it's really bad :/
It just feels really good to go full out nuclear on people sometimes and I haven't been able to find another outlet for what's inside me other than well crafted, artistically elegant roast. I feel this orgasmic satisfaction after I roast someone so bad they leave chat or drop off social media for a few days.
Maybe I'm asking for a non-destructive outlet for sadism?",,1577386802,,,35,40,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2550122315264191&id=2156420374634389,

2545256955750727,"4625. My parents don't know I'm gay, much less that I've had sex with multiple people and currently have a boyfriend. And having to keep all this secret is making me miserable. I really value my relationship with my parents, and I care deeply about them. But my sexuality is like a menacing storm cloud hovering over my every interaction with them. Every time they hug me, praise me, say they love me, etc, I am plagued with the corrosive thought that, sooner or later, they will never do any of that ever again. Because this just isn't sustainable; it all has to come out at some point. For once, I'm glad I was an awkward loner in High School cause I'm pretty sure it's the only reason why they don't ask why I'm not dating anyone. At least for now. But I will have to inevitably have to come out to them, because the only way to never tell them I'm gay is to never speak to them again.
And when that day comes, it'll be one of the worst days of my life. I've seen their homophobia in full play too many times. I've seen my mom flip out on a car trip, when she saw an 18-wheeler with a rainbow painted along the side. Sitting beside her, all I could do was grit my teeth and bear the hate and mockery she hurled at that truck's driver.

I often joke about getting disowned, but what else can I do? It's either start crying or start laughing about that sword hanging over my head that I can do nothing about. Only thing to do is have as many good days and memories as possible, to survive the days after, when it all comes crashing down. Or maybe it'll all turn out fine.

2540988452844244,"4587. You were my first in many ways.
What I expected to be a summer fling blossomed into something more as we began opening up to one another and shared clandestine secrets reserved only for close lovers.
You were a few states away from California yet we closed this distance every day with Facetime calls and frequent texts. I still remember shyly confessing my feelings for you, nervously anticipating your response and bracing myself for the unknown when you admitted that you could see yourself falling for me as well. We could make it work, you told me and my heart was full.
We rode off the high of summer, dreaming of future plans together and how we would visit each other frequently while I was still in school. You asked when my graduation was so you could plan to travel and celebrate with me...Your faith in our relationship made me fall for you even harder. Long distance seemed inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, yet like any high, this feeling was only temporary. I wish it wasn’t.
The first time you told me you loved me was when I was prepared to end our relationship.
I found you messaging other people after I had flown to see you and that you had redownloaded several dating apps after we decided to be exclusive. The trust I had in you crumbled and I couldn’t stomach reading your words wondering if you had thought at all about me while were writing them.
Even with tears in my eyes and anguish gnawing at my insides, I wanted so badly to believe in you. To believe in us. When I asked why you did it, you said you were scared, scared about our future and my parents’ disapproval. I remember crying all night thinking what a fool I was for allowing myself to be so vulnerable. This wasn’t how I envisioned my first relationship.
You couldn’t confront the reality of me leaving you and you took my naivety and affection for granted. I believed in giving you a second chance which looking back now was wholly undeserved. You told me nothing happened that night yet you would proceed to violate that very trust again leading up to the very end of our relationship.
Attempting to rebuild that shattered trust on my end was a daunting task that ate away at my mental and physical health. I never wanted to be that paranoid partner who always suspected their significant other, yet my devotion to you blinded me from seeing all the glaring red flags.
When I found out later that you not only cheated on me, but also dated someone else for a month, that was the final straw. It explained your distance in the final weeks, your inability to return a call or text, your desperate need for space to figure things out, your lies. I had mentally prepared myself for the end during the time so when it actually happened, I wondered why I allowed it to drag on for as long as it did.
Maybe I was clinging on to my last shred of hope that you still cared for me the way you did when you kissed me for the first time outside Union Station in LA. Maybe I wanted to believe you genuinely felt remorse for hurting me the first time around.
I feel less anger nowadays than I do freedom. My relationship with you didn’t shatter my self-worth. Rather, it reaffirmed it and serves as a reminder not to settle for anyone who makes me feel second-best. I have so much love to give to someone who is deserving of it and while you were my first in many ways, I know that the best is yet to come.","4587. You were my first in many ways.

Maybe I was clinging on to my last shred of hope that you still cared for me the way you did when you kissed me for the first time outside Union Station in LA. Maybe I wanted to believe you genuinely felt remorse for hurting me the first time around.
I feel less anger nowadays than I do freedom. My relationship with you didn’t shatter my self-worth. Rather, it reaffirmed it and serves as a reminder not to settle for anyone who makes me feel second-best. I have so much love to give to someone who is deserving of it and while you were my first in many ways, I know that the best is yet to come.",,1576636200,,,98,20,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2540988452844244&id=2156420374634389,

2535231273419962,"4545. Today I decided to finish learning a song on the piano. I walked to 711 first to pick up a yerba mate because I also planned to do my math readings after at MLK and wanted to make sure that I would be able to do so.
After a few hours, I managed to get the song down and was pretty happy with how it turned out. Soon after, I walked from Morrison to MLK where I was fortunate enough to find a good spot.
About a few minutes after setting my stuff up, a girl walked pass me and as I looked up (I get distracted a lot) I realized I recognized her. She was a girl that I saw around a lot last year at Unit 3. I remember telling my friends how cute I thought she was. The last time I ever saw her was at Trader Joe’s actually and I remember she had this dark blue sundress on which made her look amazing.
I was looking at her for a while because I never knew I’d see her again. She was with someone else and they were looking for a spot to sit down. Lo and behold they found a table that was right in front of me. I was mainly just looking down now at my notes because I didn’t want to look like a creep (I also wanted to actually get stuff done too because I did absolutely nothing over the weekend). But when I decided to take a sip of my mate, I looked up and right as I did, I noticed the girl was looking at me but she turned away the moment our eyes met. For some reason, I felt like she was staring at me for a while, as if she was trying to recognize me as I did her. I didn’t want to think much of it so I continued on with my notes. Eventually the mate kicked in and with it my bladder swelled. Having no one else studying with me, I decided to leave because I didn’t have anyone to watch my stuff and I really needed to use the restroom. I debated asking her and the person that she was with to look after my stuff but there was already someone else that was closer to ask and I thought it would’ve been weird if I went out of my way to ask them specifically.
On the walk back home, I had this weird sense of rage, like I felt mad at myself. I didn’t know why. When I got home, I went into the bathroom and immediately I broke down. I was crying, pretty badly. It took me a few minutes to recollect myself. The sight of this girl triggered something deep in my head, something I try to hide everyday.
Ever since I could remember, I’ve always felt like I didn’t have an identity, like I only did what other people told me to. That’s actually the whole reason why I came to Cal. My parents couldn’t afford USC so they told me to come here. Coming to college though, I was hoping that I would be able to discover something about myself but unfortunately I’ve yet to find anything. This girl, she made me realize that I constantly yearn for someone to understand me but at the same time I feel hopeless because of my lost sense of identity. How could someone understand me if I don’t even understand myself? I think this is the question that broke me.

Regardless of financial situation, most of Berkeley students seem to ignore disabled people in their advocacy. They aren't aware on the issues of disabled people, almost at all. If they are then it's restricted typically to those with visible mobility issues or autism (and even that is VERY limited). Allow me to elaborate: My disabled peers that need a reduced course load couldn't qualify for the Pell Grant even though their financial situation deems it necessary. Other people expect us to be able to financially support ourselves (I'm side-eyeing you confession 4277) at age 20 (before graduating college, and while we are often swimming in debt because a lot of us won't receive financial aid and the scholarships for disabled people are often VERY specific). They aren't aware of invisible disability and often assume that because I look young and energetic, I must actually be able to move physically or else I'm just ""lazy"" or ""out of shape"". They judge me for using the elevator for one level because even though I need one, I can't afford a mobility device (which would make my disability suddenly visible and therefore more acceptable c: )

I'm tired of people being rude to my hard of hearing friends who OBVIOUSLY didn't hear you asking them to move out of the way, so no you don't need to shove them or snap at them, just get their attention (see attention getting techniques in asl for some examples). I'm tired of people bringing up ""oh em gee I ate SOOO many calories today"" to my friends with disordered eating that have been in and out of the hospital because their vitals have been irregular since senior year of high school. I'm tired of people saying shit like ""we don't like to think of them as disabled or less than other people"" when they're in design class because you're right disabled people are SO subhuman.

Today, after 3months of this my boyfriend asks why do I always take a dump in his place and use his toilet paper and I said I don’t and then he said but you always ask for toilet paper and I say it’s to pee and he asked why and I said to wipe my pee when I am done and he asked why do you need to wipe just shake it and leave because that’s what he does and I said have you ever seen how a girl pees and he said no that’s why I don’t get why you need to wipe when I just shake it and leave. Can someone please tell me other guy bears at Cal are not this confused on what a female body looks like and why using even a little logic would get you the answer.

2528960014047088,"4477. TL;DR Just as I thought I found my happiness, parent approval has to be a home-wrecker.
I’m nothing exceedingly special in comparison to you Berkeley people. I’m simply average -- that’s me, and I am beyond thrilled with that. With the high standards and competition here, I can’t quite say that Berkeley is my home. But I’ve found my place here -- a subset if you will that I can find closure in -- and it’s this small bubble that defines my happiness. It took me a while to find it, but I eventually did, and I think I am the most satisfied that I have ever felt in a long time.
But my family doesn’t quite agree with this state of happiness. Simply put, they don’t think what I am doing is good enough and they think that I should aim for higher goals. It hurts me. It took me so long to come to terms with myself. But moreso than my personal opinion, I have lived my life until now trying to appease my family’s expectations of me.
Some nights, I let myself cry when I feel the emotions bubbling up. I cry thinking about how all I want is their approval. I will never question their love for me. I know that everything they have ever told me, everything that they do for me, is a result of their love. But what I yearn for is to hear those words from their lips and to be given a promise from them that I am enough. It’s bitter-sweet, although bitter more often.
I think some of you may be able to relate to this. This is not a feeling I would wish upon anyone else. To anyone reading this and relating, I would just like to tell you “you are enough.” But I recognize that it’s not me you need to hear it from. I’m painfully aware of that. I guess this is just part of letting my heart grieve.
(to anyone kind enough to suggest that I try broaching my insecurities to my family: I have. And in comparison to what my relationship with them used to be, we have made leaps and strides together. But some days, words slip and hit me hard. I sometimes contemplate distancing myself under the sanction that our relationship is toxic, but at the end of the day, I love them too much to do that. It just feels like I’m in a constant tug-of-rope by staying nearby to them)","4477. TL;DR Just as I thought I found my happiness, parent approval has to be a home-wrecker.

2526992314243858,"4459. Sorry this is kinda long.
I am so frustrated rn but really need to vent. After seeing someone else post issues with professors and disability stuff on Overheard, I just wanted to share this.
CW: some suicidality stuff mentioned, but nothing beyond thoughts
I deal with some mental health issues, with the most applicable one here being Bipolar 2. Basically this means my highs don’t get too high but my lows can get really low. I used to frequently have sudden lows that would last for 3-6 days where I could barely function. I would barely be able to hold myself together. I frequently ruminate over the idea of me being a bad person and that I should kill myself (less common version of OCD, obsessing over being a good person), but normally I don’t actually want to, so I don’t do anything besides get frustrated about having the thoughts. In lows, these thoughts are so loud they are pretty much all I hear, and when depressed, suicide looks like more of an option. There were definitely times when my meds weren’t fully right where I should have been checked into the hospital for my own safety.
Thankfully, I got through it. I worked my ass off, and with tons of therapy and trying different meds, I finally got to a place where it isn’t happening so much. Because this stuff can still happen (albeit to lesser degrees than needing to be hospitalized), I do have DSP homework extensions. This way, I can still maintain my life even if my health gets in the way. My grades before DSP have been directly tied with my health: I can do really well with really heavy course loads and such when I’m not being dragged down by this stuff.
The issue is I did have a couple of lows earlier this semester. I had already emailed one of my professors (in CS) about this, but he refused to actually give me homework extensions. Apparently he thought it’d be better if I get the homework a day early, but that would require me being ahead in the class, which defeats the whole purpose of this. It would be giving me the homework before the lecture for the material ever happened.
The professor’s logic was that he absolutely HAD to release solutions right after homework was due, even though if he released them a day later it would still be in time for people to ask questions in discussion and such. Just that one day would had been enough for me to catch up. I’ve had DSP for a couple semesters now, and there are so many ways professors work around this: 16a assigns subsets of the homework, some just delay solutions by a single day, and some use the trust policy. They at least respect the situation of people with disabilities enough to help them out.
I contacted DSP asking for help, and they did email the professor and assured me they would resolve this, but this kept happening for weeks. I even had a low line up with a midterm; I emailed the GSI asking to use the midterm drop policy (designed for conflicts, but syllabus never specified), but got no response. Even if DSP got him to give me extensions, he wasn’t going to let me make up the homeworks I tried to do, and regardless of what happened, I wasn’t sure he was going to let me use the midterm drop policy. I had to give up. There was no point getting behind in my other classes to try and catch up here just to still not have all those points count and get a bad grade.
This was so frustrating. It was in a class I was really interested in and knew I could do well in. Because of the professor, though, I couldn’t get the help I needed when my health got in the way. I don’t blame DSP, but this is frustrating. I haven’t had any lows since that midterm, and I am crushing all my other classes. If I just had help then, I’d be on top of that class too.
The frustrating thing when it comes to mental health stuff is the fine line of arguing that you deserve accommodations, but you can still function. So many people tend to chalk up issues like these to “not being able to handle” workloads and stuff. I got into Berkeley for a reason. I can handle this workload. I deserve to be here. It’s not my fault that my brain attacks me, or that it took years of trying different meds and dosages to finally stop having the lows so much. I want to be able to do well and succeed. Just please let me.","4459. Sorry this is kinda long.

It's not like I'm doing this for attention, I'm really not. A cry for help maybe? It's just.. the reason I stopped cutting before was because I saw how much it was hurting everyone I cared about. Now that I've moved away from home, they're not here to stop me and no one here is making any effort to. It's hard to believe I am worth more than this when it seems like no one else believes it...

2518280261781730,"4364. So, I'm depressed. As per all my other confessions. And I met up with this guy from tinder honestly out of boredom a few weeks ago. All of my great stories begin this way. We had sex every night for 10 days, multiple times a day. Yes, I'm dead inside so I feel validated by sleeping with frat boys. I'm very dead inside but that's beside the point. He's honestly pretty cute and sweet and has grown on me. I like this guy. Anyways, I told him I like him and he always hesitantly says it back like he's required to or something. The story gets better hang on. So he mentioned something about his sex bucket list, and I did too. Something on my list was to have sex on campus, because I fucking hate Berkeley so much, and something on his list was to do anal. I've done anal, it's not fun. He's done it on campus before, alright cool. So we decided to get gains from trade because fuck yes econ fuck yes capitalism. So we traded our goods with our comparitive advantage and I did it with him on campus. I won't say where (it's where you're sitting right now). A few days later, he's like wanna do anal? And I'm like ah shit I feel super obligated to do this now, and I want him to like me. So today I finally gave in and did it with him. It was not enjoyable but he was so into it. I want him to like me but he is totally just using me for sex it's so sad. The more I try to get to know him, the more sex he wants. So anyways I wanna puke, I shit like 6 times today, and I have a massive headache and a midterm tomorrow. As I said before, I did anal before, wasn't for me. I did it twice, still not for me. I hate Berkeley so much. So fucking much. I can't wait to graduate and get the fuck out of here. I'm sorry mom. So sorry. Go bears y'all.","4364. So, I'm depressed. As per all my other confessions.

A. Is anyone else tired of all these people complaining about liberals ""shutting down free speech on campus?"" Don't get me wrong: I think it's vital to provide a platform for perspectives even if you don't agree with their perspective. You don't have to agree or listen to them; rather, you shouldn't. That being said, all these recent confessions and posts on overheard just say exactly the same thing. What bothers me is these people act like they came up with a such a new idea--as if 90% of us didn't already recognize that free speech is important. Hot take: you're not changing anybody's mind any more than the protestors are. Both of you refuse to see the alternative viewpoint. You know who's the ultimate winner from this? Freaking Ann Coulter.
B. People who think that the protests last night were ONLY about shutting down Ann Coulter are missing the point. It was truly beautiful to be a part of what was largely a student protest that supported and stood in solidarity with the marginalized and oppressed student communities that ARE put in danger by Ann Coulter's rhetoric and by the enormous police presence paid for and authorized by Chancellor Christ. Two years ago, when Berkeley College Republicans tried to bring Coulter to speak about immigration, she publicly pledged that she would reading the names of undocumented students at Cal. If you are having trouble wrapping your head around why so many students and Berkeley residents turned out in THE THOUSANDS last night, you should maybe cultivate some more empathy....and.... I don't know.... get your head out of your ass or something.
C. Yesterday at the Ann Coulter protests I saw multiple elderly people get pushed, screamed at, punched, and kicked by the so called ""tolerant, accepting"" leftists who were ""protesting."" It took me 30 minutes just to get into an event that I paid to see, and I was also pushed and attacked while trying to get in
D. As a student who went to see Ann Coulter for press, I am disappointed in the Berkeley community. Ann Coulter could have been irrelevant like Ben Shapiro was when he came to Stanford. Instead, you gave her more attention and fueled the full auditorium of people inside, radicalizing the students and adults inside even more. Regardless of whether you stand for Ann Coulter, refusing to let people in who have paid money, especially some of the adults who drove hours and paid hundreds of dollars, is not the right answer. You can’t just form a human blockade and refuse to let people in, forcing us to climb over the blockade and get thrown to the ground by the police for breaking the law. I feel for the people arrested and the one person seriously injured inside the auditorium. However, Berkeley allowed Ann Coulter to come here and speak; you didn’t have the right to sensor free speech like that. To all the protesters, I feel dissapointed and sad for you because you gave this event wayyyy too much media attention and only contributed to the polarization and radicalization of society. If you really cared about liberal ideas, you wouldn’t have given Ann Coulter so much free press and more of a reason to hate liberals even more.

2515112342098522,"4336. I’m a logical person, so it always irritates me that we were such a cliched anomaly.
I met you for the first time the day I moved in. I’d bounced down the hall, tripping over myself, completely excited about the prospect of meeting new friends. Your mother opened the door. I, still filled with the kind of adrenaline one gets from moving across the world, introduced myself to your mom, tripping over my words. She invited me in, and called out your name. You looked up, eyes round and curious, setting down the cello you’d been tuning.
“Hi,” you said. “I’m ***, and I’m from Seoul!”
You got me started on a whole ramble about all the places I’d lived in, and somehow, I finished off with— “yeah, and before this I lived in Shanghai!”
Embarrassment suddenly flooded over me. Gosh, I’d done it again. I berated myself for rushing into a weird tangent— when introducing myself, no less. You laughed, however, and told me it was nice to meet me, and that I should show you pictures, sometime.
Your eyes crinkled in the prettiest way when you smiled. Sounds cheesy, but I knew you were gonna change my life at that moment.
I don’t know if it was that moment, or sometime during that year, but you became my best friend. You were blue skies, lazy afternoons and running through puddles. Laughing with you was like the taste of my favourite mango pudding. You asked me to move in, and I hugged you. Best hug ever.
Funny, the way in which love changes people. You always told me, that I was too logical, too rational, that not everything was a debate and that objectiveness is simply a subjective illusion. I’d always prided my ability to be objective and see the world for what it is. I always liked being free— nothing had stopped me from moving across the world on a whim, and nothing would tie me down. But when you were crying that night and I sat with you instead of studying for my exam, I found it surprisingly easy to let go of the independence I fiercely loved. I remembered thinking that I could die for you, and realising that such a thought did not scare me at all.
I remember I confessed to you in such a cliche way. I left a letter in your bag, crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. When you said “yes”, you made my whole year.
I remember the two of us, being the kind of crazy rich brats with a liberal education we were, discussing the impact of westernisation on Confucian values and resulting shifts in class structure five minutes after scrolling through the Saint Laurent Fall Collection. I liked all of your ideas, and I was so impressed by your essays that I was mad at myself for being so impressed. I knew you were going places, and I’m still certain of that now. You got mad sometimes, but you know I only debate ideas I’m impressed by.
I remember exactly why we broke up. Actually, I wasn’t surprised at all. The fragility of our relationship continuously trailed behind me in the time we were together, lurking in corners and looming in the peripheral. We had problems that no one knew how to deal with, because what do you do with two lost kids with broken families and broken lives who were at once the silent oppressors at the top as well as the pitiful remains the system spat out. In a way, we only had each other. So when you told me we couldn’t be together anymore, I understood. Because the real reason, looming over the co-dependency, your anxiety, my depressive episodes and both of our family issues, was the fact that we would be forever outcasted from society for what we were.
I know you want to inherit assets. Who doesn’t? I’m in the same boat. You’d be thrown from the ruthless world of the upper class in a heartbeat if they knew about us. So would I. It bothers me too, but I know it bothered you more, even if you pretended that you were better than that. It’s human to be upset about that, because it isn’t right that we are forced to choose between love and our livelihoods.
We never talk about it— being in a gay relationship, that is. It’s too harrowing to think about what our worlds do to people like us.
There’s no way it could’ve worked. Sometimes, I ask God why I was born this way. Sometimes, I look to the universe, and think about how thirteen billion years after the Big Bang, on a tiny, damp rock floating in space, two kids held hands and had a love story. Sometimes, I think that the fact that we are of the same gender is such an inconsequential detail.
I’m a logical person, so I can break down love and define it as certain connections in our brains that cause the release of serotonin and causes psychosomatic reactions such as uncontrollable smiling and a warm feeling in the chest. I’m a logical person, and I’ve concluded that the only way love makes sense is if it makes no sense. I’m a logical person, but I have to admit that there was definitely some magic in everything lining up in such a cliched way to me leaning against you on the train and realising, suddenly, that I loved you.","4336.

My boyfriend makes me feel insecure sometimes even though we're a relatively happy couple. Our 6 month anniversary is coming up, and I guess I'm disappointed with how he hasn't fully trusted me yet to meet his parents and how he's uncomfortable sometimes when I'm with other people. He's told me that I have a vibe when I'm with other people and while he hates that he can't feel like I'm loyal, he can't change that feeling. I've started to dread waking up to a huge paragraph of text - it's normally about something I did that he later reflected on and made him upset in some way. One of them was about feeling like I didn't give him enough attention, one was about lack of attention, how I could be using him, etc. We're doing LDR (he doesn't go to cal but lives in Norcal), and every time he does this I just feel sad - but I also want him to be able to open up to me and tell me how he genuinely feels.
I just don't know why I'm not good enough or what I'm doing wrong: I've definitely spent a lot more time visiting him (about 2x a week since last month), I've tried to be more affectionate physically (in a non-sexual way), and I'm trying to show I care. I don't know whether he knows I'm trying.
For context, he is honestly one of the most caring people I know even before we started dating. He'll take me out all the time and won't' let me pay for anything even though I try (sometimes I have to steal his card from him so I can pay), He's uber eats me food when I'm hungry at 2 am studying, he visits me when he knows I'm not mentally okay. He's literally perfect - caring and devoted, but he also has strong trust issues from ex-ABGs and is super emotion-driven and that's the downside.
We also have very different career goals, I'm at cal on the track to law, he's graduated and trying to figure life out. I just don't know how long we're going to last at this rate. I'm actually scared of making something for him for our 6 months because I don't want to put all my love and effort and time to making him a gift if he'l throw it away if we ever break up, and I ALSO don't know how to repay him in a way for the care, love, and money he's spent on me because I'm broke. I think I love him, I'm scared to lose him, and idk how to make this LDR work.

Not sure if it was a joke or if he was just mocking his friend? But I’m genuinely curious if they would have been as enthusiastic if she was Vietnamese/Indonesian.

He passed on an STD and to this day, I still do not know if he informed all the other women.

There was that environmental protest thing a couple days ago. I'm glad yall were so enthusiastic, but at the end of the day, you're just walking around a campus where most people probably agree with you. I get it, it feels great to tell people that you were a part of something, that you stood against the people in power, blah blah blah. The issues you're complaining about are indeed important for the world and I'm not necessarily against all of this peacocking around. Just remember where the real source of your power comes from: the vote. Year after year, I see the youth of this country consistently turning out in smaller numbers than other generations. Of course, if you're in a state like CA, it doesn't really matter, but in other states, it does. So vote and vote consistently. Don't let the current administration trigger you into missing that chance. They barely managed to contain us in 2016. I'm optimistic about the future. It's been 4 years and we've only gotten stronger. Voting is hard, I know. You have to struggle against forces that might be beyond your control. Maybe your phone battery dies and the alarm clock doesn't go off. Maybe you get ambushed on the way to the polling booth. Protests are cool, they're nice to have on the cv, fun to talk about and discuss while eating at taco bell. Idk, where the confession is in this mess of a post, but whatever.","4091.

2489212414688515,"4066. What's so bad or good about making generalizations? Seeing some of these confessions and their comments made me think about how, in my perspective, a lot of right-leaning policies and positions seem to be based off of generalizations, from race to homeless people and to immigration. I generally think that generalizations are not the ethically best way to go about doing things, especially in a country that takes pride in its diversity. However, generalizations can make things ""efficient"" in a sense, particularly in terms of money.
For example, if we were to generalize that all people were born normal and disabilities weren't a thing, there would be no point of having DSP. However, we realize that this assumption is terrible to make, so therefore we have a program set in place to help these people. Despite the fact that it probably takes a considerable amount of money to provide all the services that DSP does, it helps students who would otherwise not be able to make the most out of their education at this school. On the other hand, I've also heard of students taking advantage of the DSP services when they don't necessarily fully need it, and that acts as a waste of money and possibly even as a disadvantage to other students.
A hypothetical scenario I once thought of was the amount of money it would take to provide gender neutral bathrooms everywhere. I understand that it's important to respect these people, but the amount of money that it would cost to retrofit every single building in the US, or even just on campus alone, with a third gender neutral bathroom is insane. It's good that some locations, like Moffit and now the RSF, have this available, but where should it start or stop? How do we balance spending our budget on a minority of the population with providing services that everyone would benefit from, especially at a campus which is already greatly in debt and can't fix a good number of toilets that are already in use?
I don't wanna sound like a privileged prick (it might be too late though), but I wish I had a better sense of how much of our tuition, and eventually salary as we move to the work force, it is our responsibility to provide for minority groups that most people including myself would benefit from.","4066.

And I specifically remember growing up thinking it was not weird because I thought every other mom touched their son’s penis on the regular. But in my early 10s, I remember that I started to feel something funny when I touched it, and once my dick started getting hard, I stopped letting my mom touch it, around when I was 11 or 12 ish. And thinking about it made me feel really weird about my mom. I feel slightly violated but I don’t want to blame her because I thought it was ok too, at the time. I never felt any sexual pleasure or anything from it because I was too young, but it makes me feel weird now because I realized that parents can sexually abuse their kids too. It’s not that I never knew it, it’s just that I never thought it happened to me. Thinking about it makes me uncomfortable with my parents and I kind of never want to go back home.

This submission we just received echoes a complaint we have now seen several times. Unfortunately, it reflects a common misconception about the nature of Confessions and Facebook in general.
Confessions is a Facebook Page. Overheard is a Facebook Group. The two types of Facebook entities are distinct in a good number of ways, but the biggest ways are as follows:
1. A Facebook Page can only be posted on (on the main timeline) by the page owners, while a Group can be posted in by any member of the group.
2. A Facebook Page has ""followers"", while a Group has ""members"".
3. A Facebook Page is always Public, while a Group can be Private or even Secret.
The structure of Confessions - an entity which takes in submissions and posts them anonymously, only allowing its followers to comment - lends itself quite perfectly to being a Page rather than a Group, and so Confessions was created as a Page. Sadly, as a Page, it cannot be made private in any way. We also can't transform it into a Group easily, nor would we if we could, because a Group just isn't the right kind of thing for Confessions to be.
We hope you (and your parents) understand.","""I do not understand why confessions is an open group.

But the thing is, I just paid one off and it made me think about why I did it. Do I really want to die so bad that I'm paying off my loans at 20?? Or do I actually want a credit score good enough to have a future???

2473804852895938,"3915. It's crunch time for me to finish my final paper in an incomplete class. This is the one thing standing between me and my Bachelor's, so naturally I'm under a lot of stress as I tear through 100 dense pages of primary and secondary literature that I should've finished a year ago. As I pass the Chipotle on Telegraph 20 minutes before closing, I'm feeling lots of feelings--including more than a small amount of pride over my rapid progress so far tonight--and make a snap decision to break my veganism before plowing onward with my paper in an all-nighter.
Inside, the tables are sparsely populated and the line stretches back barely far enough to bend around the barrier. As I wait, I guiltily scan these surroundings for anyone I might know who could witness my ethical lapse. Once I reach the counter, though, I am single-minded and Not. Fucking. Around. I'm a polite customer as always, but this is serious business and I'm not leaving room for follow-up questions. ""I'll take a steak bowl to go with a tortilla on the side, please."" (See that efficiency? **Not fucking around.**) I load that bad boy up: Brown rice (not ideal, but they've just run out of white). Black and pinto beans. Tiny helping of fajita veggies, two salsas, sour cream and cheese (I've dearly missed these two dairy products--easily more than I've missed the meat). Guac ""which I know is extra."" Lettuce. The resulting beauty towers above the lip of the bowl. If future me is going to feel guilty, he's also going to feel pretty damn satisfied. Here's my card; go ahead and toss that $12.13 on my debt pile.
A few minutes later, I'm power-walking down Bowditch toward home with my prize--forged in mass-produced misery, pollution, and waste, but I'm not thinking about that at the moment--in hand, oblivious to the juices seeping out of the bowl and permeating the bottom of the bag.
Rookie mistake.
As I'm passing People's Park, the bowl crashes out of the bag. The sidewalk smacks the lid and topmost 60ish percent of the meal underneath it into the air. (Fuck you, Newton's third law. I hate you so goddamned much.) Sour cream, cheese, guac, all gone. All belong to the sidewalk now, along with about half of my steak (and also all of my lettuce, but let's not get distracted from the tragic aspects of what's just happened). I'm dumbstruck. I'm Alex Wolff in Hereditary; I can't believe what my carelessness has wrought and I have no idea how to proceed. After a beat or two, I scoop up what the sidewalk hasn't claimed (along with everything that isn't food) and complete my journey home in silence.
As I sit at my desk eating my pitiful little bowl, a thick, tantalizing smear of guac on the inside of the lid taunts me; I can't remember whether the lid landed face-up or face-down and thus definitely can't trust it.
I feel like I've just lived through a shitty Victorian fable and learned nothing. But I guess if I had to extract a moral for anyone reading my tale of woe, it'd be this: Never let your Chipotle bag hang carelessly from your hand. Cradle it in your arms like your first-born child until it's all the way home, safe and sound.","3915. It's crunch time for me to finish my final paper in an incomplete class.

Months go by and I’m blissfully unaware that my boyfriend that I love very much has been tested positive for mouth herpes. We go on and do what we do and my vagina starts to itch and be red. I’m go to the doctor and think it’s a simple yeast infection or something. But no. The doctor looks at me and says “ya you got herpes”. I was immediately confused and upset and I tell my boyfriend. He admits that he tested positive for mouth herpes. I was confused and angry that he didn’t tell me. The thing is 60% of people have herpes and I still very much love him and know he didn’t do it to hurt me. He just genuinely didn’t know it was a big deal because it’s so common and didn’t know he could spread it to me. I broke up with him when I found out but now I’m going back and forth about whether I should not talk to him or be with him. Herpes is very stereotyped and I feel ashamed to tell any of my friends.

I lived with shitty roommates who would turn off my phone in the middle of the night and unplug my alarm clock so that I’d miss my morning lecture. I worked two part time jobs, and had a hard time making friends due to my lack of free time. I never had enough money for good food as all of my money went to tuition/materials. I was exhausted everyday that I didn’t even have time to cry... except one time when I was bussing a table (last customer of the night) and I was so hungry I ate their leftover noodles. I wondered why it was so salty and realized I was crying into the bowl and eating my own tears.
Campus wide commencement came and no friends or family of mine attended.
To end this on a lighter note, I may have had a hard life while studying but now, I am happy to say that through perseverance and the skills I earned through my odd jobs, I’ve learned to grow thick skin and I now manage my own city office for a nationwide corporate company.
My main focus was to always apply the best version of myself in every situation because I knew that even if I lost everything, the things that nobody could ever take away from me was my education and experience.
P.S. I graduated a while ago.. the reason I had no support was due to the fact I applied to study abroad to get away from my parents’ control.
P.P.S. I am happily married and we have a beautiful child. We also travel a lot. It is very important to open yourself to new opportunities to meet new people, but most importantly, it is absolute key to find a work-life balance.","3875.

I don’t know. I didn’t know it would’ve affected me this much until now. I thought I’d finally have a home in Berkeley but I guess I should’ve opted for non-LGBT housemates. Or at least don’t put a person of color inside a house full of white people.

When my dad died, it broke me. I was just 16. I remember two weeks after he passed, I had a mental breakdown in front of the class. So I stopped going to class. I stopped eating and sleeping.

2468486106761146,"3844. Okay for like all of my life, I've been known to be boy crazy. I'm pretty sure I'm a straight girl. I've dated guys, made out with them, fallen in love with them, etc. Girls were not on my radar at all. I was so sure I'm straight, that if I were a guy, I'd be so fucking gay.
Something happened when I started college. I was at my friend's play and one of the actresses just took my breath away. I spent majority of that play thinking how I would date this girl. Because I'm sure I'm straight, I did nothing and nothing happened, so I thought nothing of it. I just thought ""If I liked girls, she would be my type, I guess?"" It's not like she was typical jaw-dropping beautiful. She was just jaw-dropping beautiful for me.
This past semester, I was working and this girl sat near me and I think it was pretty clear we were eyeing each other. She eventually approached me to ask for help regarding her work, but it was clear she didnt need any help. I have no idea if she was into girls, but I was into her. But like I said, I'm straight (?) so I meekly did my job, helped her, then moved on. There have been a couple more situations like this.
I watch and like lesbian porn (and gay porn for the matter), but I feel there's something lacking for myself. But more recently, I feel I wouldn't be opposed to making out with a girl or going down on them (I sometimes fantasize about it the way I fantasize guys fucking me, though not as much). If I'm in a room full of pretty guys and girls, I usually only check out the guys. It's just that sometimes, some girls really, really get my attention. Also, someone (she's bi) at a party told me I gave bi vibes. I don't know what that means but I was fascinated. I don't think I would ever date a girl (as a girl, I know how we can be fucking insane, but honestly, boys aren't better), but I couldn't even if I wanted to (I'm in a situation where I couldnt come out if I am indeed bi).
These are the facts. I'm trying to figure out if I'm bi or not, especially after proclaiming I'm straight for so long. I dont know why all of a sudden, for the past couple years, certain girls have been on my radar. So my friends: if you had to gander what I am, what am I?","3844.

I was pretty scared of bringing up this viewpoint with my friend groups without anonymity because I am afraid that they would kick me out of their circles if I had such an opinion -- which is why I'm coming here.
A lot of the things on the news nowadays, and on this confessions page, is related to women (and sometimes men) saying that some other man has raped them, sexually assaulted them, or done more disgusting/vile behavior towards them. A lot of the posts are really vivid and descriptive, and horrendous.
A couple months ago, if I heard a story of a rape or assault, I used to automatically side with the victims without thinking twice because, if I didn't know either party, I auto-sided with the victim (because benefit of the doubt)
Until recently... one of my friends was arrested by the police in his hometown because his ex-girlfriend accused him of raping her. I flew back and talked to him because, honestly, I was really REALLY surprised that he would do anything of that sort. This is a guy who volunteers every Saturday at a children's hospital, he doesn't drink or do any drugs, he plays video games, and honestly, he is a really really nice dude. Super Christian religious guy and like... when I found out, I was *shook*.
Anyways, I talked to him and he started crying and he told me that he and her had only had sex several times and he said that he made it very clear to her (verbally) each time they did stuff and if she said no or indicated that she didn't want to do something, he did not continue.
I really believe him. I've known this guy for 15 years and he wouldn't lie to me.
I don't think anyone else does though. They didn't get any proof (which is why he got out of jail), his reputation in the media of his local newspaper is tarnished, he was under suspension from his high school, and overall I think his life got completely fucked. Even though legally he was ""okay"", in terms of his friend groups and reputation at school, he's completely screwed. His family is considering selling their house and moving to another state....
Is it really appropriate to automatically side with the victim? (what if they are lying?) How would we know if they are lying? or if they are telling the truth?
Often times things take months or years to come out in the open, what if the story changes in the victims mind over time (memories often get convoluted)?
I feel like it would be TERRIBLE to not believe a victim who has actually suffered a rape or sexual assault....
but at the same time, I feel like it would be just as terrible to be labeled an ""assailant"" when you hadn't really done anything bad in the first place.

It was a perfectly ordinary 51B ride home until I spotted a cute guy step on. Whoa. Slick hair, nice glasses (I love glasses), sleeves half-rolled up on toned arms, and best of all, that beautiful dark brooding look in his eyes. I fidgeted in my seat for a couple stops, making up my mind. YOLO, right? Berkeley's a crazy place, there's always that minuscule chance of making it. I wanna live without regrets....
So the next time the bus stops, I get up, walk over to him (more nervous than a campus squirrel staring down a peregrine falcon), probably smiling like an idiot, and my two remaining brain cells manage to articulate, ""Hi!""
Miraculously, he says ""Hi"" back, and before I can say something I'll lament for the rest of my life, a look of understanding dawns across his face, and he says--
""Oh, I'm a GSI for a class you're in, right?""
Ladies and gentlecubs, never before have I empathized so much with the too-squishy dregs of boba pearls that are left at the bottom of your cup after you finish all the tea. In other words, less than the lowest trash. ""Live without regrets"" my big brown tapioca ass. How on Earth does this happen? How?! And the worst part was, with how many classes I'm taking, I still didn't recognize him!!
He made small talk, and somehow I managed to keep my head on and not cry or outright faint. After what felt like a year, he got off at his stop with a ""See you Tuesday."" It took me frantically looking up my schedule before I finally remembered this guy. The faces of everyone I've met in the past 2 weeks are all but wiped from my memory. And we've only had one lab so far. Yet he remembered me asking a question after said lab. And I walk in there again soon. FML. It's stunning how this GSI singlehandedly dashed my hopes and dreams for the semester far earlier than any professor.'s midterm.","3787. Today, I fucked up.

2463434020599688,"3784. I’m not sure if someone like me is meant to live for long in this world.
I think I am too sensitive to things that happen to me, and I’m a huge overthinker. A year ago, my boyfriend and I broke up, and I haven’t gotten over him at all. Recently, we met up again and this time he says he still has feelings for me. I don’t believe him because I know he was apparently involved with someone else a few months after our breakup, but now I can’t stop thinking about him even more. I really really like him so much. My feelings are stopping me from doing the best thing for me, which is probably to stand up for myself and not let him come back halfheartedly. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that we can date again. I also know that I’m lonely, and that this isn’t the best time for me to be dating someone. I’m lost because I don’t know how to feel content.
Then, in the last week, I had multiple interviews that stressed me out. As if that wasn’t enough, really bad drama came up in my friend group. I feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore. I don’t even want to reveal all the details here because I don’t want someone messaging me asking me if I posted this.
I wonder if I’m socializing the wrong way? I like to help people and be the “therapist” friend (I know many would advise against that, but I really enjoy knowing that people feel better after talking to me). I just want to know how to live in a more sustainable way. I can’t keep going through these heavy phases. Every morning when I wake up, I feel my heart sink from the burden of things I know I’ll need to deal with.","3784. I’m not sure if someone like me is meant to live for long in this world.

I used to have my doubts about wearing it but after the growing pains, I decided it was for me. I also dress modestly in general (showing no skin and no super tight clothes). If you choose the hijab, then this is a given. They are not mutually exclusive because together, they indicate a certain belief of modesty. My other hijabi friends all dress similarly modest... some people might show their forearms or a little lower leg, but generally our appearance reflects the values we choose to believe in. But every once in a while, I will meet another hijabi who is ok with wearing super tight clothes or spending the weekend out of town without their hijab. And it confuses me as a Muslim. To me, the hijab is freeing because it is my choice. Nobody is forcing me to wear it other than myself. So it breaks my heart when I other hijabis who say they believe in wearing it yet feel like they need to escape from it by overcompensating modesty with tight clothes that intentionally show off their figure or even ditching it completely for a night or two. I guess I'm just confused and have never talked to my hijabi friends about this because they will criticize me. I don't want to judge others but at the same time can't understand why you would choose to wear the hijab but want to find loop holes.","3723.

It's painful to see life going on up there and I'm sitting at home not knowing what to do with my life. I decided to take a semester off because I wasn't sure about what I want to do in terms of a career and major. I've also been dealing with anxiety and depression for the last year. My last year at cal was hard and depressing, and it changed me for the worst. I had a nervous break down at the thought of going up there again. I was almost all packed and then I couldn't push myself to go. I cried and cried, but I wish I just sucked it up and went. I wanted to go through recruitment so bad, and I wanted to experience my new apartment. I don't know why I didn't just push past my anxiety and go. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME. Has anyone experienced something like this? I feel like this is the end of the world even though I know it's not. Why can't I just feel better and at peace with my decision? I felt at peace on the first night. I wanted to go up, my gut was telling me to go up, but my mind wouldn't push past the anxiety of packing and leaving the comfort of my home. But now my home is not comforting and I just feel anxious all the time. I think this is because I see visions of the future down here that I don't like. I just want to run away from everything. I regret not pushing myself to go up and just dealing with the crying.","3663. I decided to take a break this semester from cal, but now that I am I regret the decision and I want to go back.

Obviously you can't just walk up to someone and ask for sex so I took it slow and asked her out. We saw a movie together then made out in her car afterward. She was into me so we kept seeing each other. Slowly we progressed through sexual activities and each time I asked for consent and never rushed or pushed her to do anything I didn't think she was ready for. Eventually after about three months we had sex and it was incredible. God I loved fucking her more than anything. Her whole body was so squishy and jiggly it made everything amazing. I realized that I had achieved my goal of getting to fuck her and then getting to fuck her all the time. Before that we always made out and did other stuff like blowjobs and titty sucking and it was all amazing. I really didn't talk to her too much since she wasn't that interesting to me, I was only into her for the sexual stuff. Eventually I moved away and I broke up with her, she was heartbroken and I was a little sad. The whole relationship I was really nice to her, made her laugh, and bought her flowers and food and stuff. I still know that I was only doing all that just so I could use her body to pleasure myself. Honestly after typing all this, I wasn't mean to her at all. Yeah I had a lot of sex with her and we did all of sexual stuff but I was always so nice and made her really happy. So I'm saying fellas, this is a way to get a girl to have sex with you. It just takes a really long time and you have to act like a gentlemen out of the sheets.","3642. I feel bad about how I was with an old girlfriend of mine.

If you told me these things in person, of course I'd congratulate you or at the very *least* say I'm happy for you, but there's something about making posts like this which makes it look like you're just seeking validation and attention, and it's annoying, esp. when I often see these same people looking down upon me in real life or never recognizing others for their achievements",,1567614600,,,31,15,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2444923099117447&id=2156420374634389,

Thank you to everyone who replied to my post. I reread your replies over and over, and carry them with me in my heart to this day. I was too scared to reach out to any of the commenters, though I appreciate that you cared enough to offer your friendship to me. It means a lot to me to feel heard.
I wanted to give an update. I did anonymously contact the UC Berkeley police department about his firearms and threatening comments. I don’t know exactly what happened, though I know he is no longer a UCB student and has moved away. I also know from his (now-exes) Instagram that they broke up (based on her deleting their pics together and posting with a new guy).
I left campus as well, and started seeing a therapist. I was diagnosed with PTSD and joined a support forum for sexual assault survivors. It means a lot to be able to talk to other women who have gone through the same thing and been able to move forward. My family isn’t super understanding about what went on, so I don’t talk to them. But I have this forum and my therapist.
I don’t feel like I will ever be able to walk across the Cal campus ever again. I deleted a bunch of people from there off my social media. It gave me anxiety every time I saw a post that somehow my ex was going to be in it, or that he would comment and I would see his name and face again. I still get anxious and fearful. But being farther away and knowing people don’t know where I am makes me feel safe.
I am dating someone who is wonderful and sweet and kind. He makes me feel special, and likes to show off our relationship rather than hide it. He was happy to be tagged in the same things and post pictures of us and have me meet his friends, unlike my ex. He knows about my past and we are taking the physical part slow. FWIW he is Indian. I am trying to get over my anxiety about Asians and my therapist and I are working on that too. I want to be able to be friends with all different kinds of people regardless of my past experiences.
Thank you again for reading my story and giving me support. I hope it makes you all feel safer to know he is gone. To his ex (who I think knows who I am now), I am very glad to see you moved on as well. Wishing you the very best.","3449.5. I am the author of confession 1518.

2415593985383692,"3360. I've never told anyone this (not even my close friends now), but I wasn't the cheerful, enthusiastic person with friends back then. In middle school, I didn't have friends. I was in a bad environment at home where my parents and grandparents didn't listen to me most of the time. This happened for most of my life, but my grandparents are getting better at listening. My parents aren't. This made me feel inferior, and that my decisions and voice didn't matter at all. I chose not to speak up in elementary and middle school. Every teacher conference ended up with them saying that I needed to talk more. I always saw their look of pity every time they asked the class to get into groups for projects and I had none to choose from.
I was that kid in middle school where people took advantage of. Kids copied my homework, and I didn't have the guts to say no. Maybe if I let them copy the assignments, they would let me be their friend. Sometimes, I would lie that do the homework assignments. Since I didn't speak much, rumors would go around the school that I hit someone or that I simply didn't speak English. I was meek and couldn't stand up for myself. How could I when I have no one to back me up, or feel like I should be heard?
My past made me feel ashamed of who I was, but I am not the same person back then. I guess I've never really told anyone about this because I feel like people will treat me differently or see me in another perspective. I just want them to know that I am not fully proud of who I am today, but I'm getting better. I'm trying to take it one step at a time. When people meet me, sometimes I am surprised that they actually want to talk to me or think that I am worth listening to. I now go out of my way to talk to people and develop relationships that are meaningful.","3360.

My parents aren't. This made me feel inferior, and that my decisions and voice didn't matter at all. I chose not to speak up in elementary and middle school. Every teacher conference ended up with them saying that I needed to talk more. I always saw their look of pity every time they asked the class to get into groups for projects and I had none to choose from.
I was that kid in middle school where people took advantage of. Kids copied my homework, and I didn't have the guts to say no. Maybe if I let them copy the assignments, they would let me be their friend. Sometimes, I would lie that do the homework assignments. Since I didn't speak much, rumors would go around the school that I hit someone or that I simply didn't speak English. I was meek and couldn't stand up for myself. How could I when I have no one to back me up, or feel like I should be heard?
My past made me feel ashamed of who I was, but I am not the same person back then. I guess I've never really told anyone about this because I feel like people will treat me differently or see me in another perspective. I just want them to know that I am not fully proud of who I am today, but I'm getting better. I'm trying to take it one step at a time. When people meet me, sometimes I am surprised that they actually want to talk to me or think that I am worth listening to. I now go out of my way to talk to people and develop relationships that are meaningful.",,1564930800,,,72,6,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2415593985383692&id=2156420374634389,

I'd like to apologize for her- she doesn't realize that being able to speak a second language and having an attachment to your culture through it is a wonderful thing because her entire family and my grandfather's family were tormented away from it as a child. Both of them were bullied so badly in school that they never spoke their languages again, and didn't pass them on to their children, but I've seen the longing in her eyes and in her children's when she meets someone from her homeland.

2414213118855112,"3302. I feel like it's been a long time since I've had a conversation at this school outside of class where I had to think beyond ''So umm, watcha doing this weekend, wanna go party?''
This is one of the problems with being a member of the undergrad intelligentsia: it’s difficult to find others on a similar wavelength. This is not what I was expecting from Cal.
I'm looking for someone to watch and discuss French new wave films with, including some of the classics by Jean-Luc Godard and the like. I'm looking for someone who doesn't look at me funny when I use the word ''hirsute'' to describe oski. I’m looking for someone who, instead of sharing those dreaded memes on UCBMFET, prefers to wander the main stacks in search of works by Maurice Merleau Ponty. I’m looking for someone who also codes to the sound of Sergei Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No. 3 instead of that god-awful UC Berkeley Old Town Road remix. Doesn’t anyone here know about real music?
With all the emphasis on partying and getting laid, it doesn't surprise me that I can code better than most EECS majors. I’m not even in the major and yet the EECS kids on my floor come to me for help. Instead of watching Netflix, like they do all night, I practice my skills. But I digress.
I, for once, just want a friend who can give their take on Stoljar’s objections to structuralist Russellian monism, which of course refers to the widely known fact that consciousness is constituted by the intrinsic properties of fundamental physical entities: that is, by the categorical bases of fundamental physical dispositions.
Unfortunately, I have yet to meet a single undergrad who can give me an informed take on topics like these. It’s honestly a little depressing. I have also yet to meet another undergrad who's a member of MENSA (I can DM you a scanned copy of my membership card if you don’t believe me.)
My course work was supposed to be challenging, but after flying through classes that I was told would break me, like Physics 5A and CS70, I feel like I don’t have anything left to stimulate me intellectually. I currently have a 3.95 gpa and feel unfulfilled. I have made up for it by going to professors’ office hours to debate their research. But this is not the same as having a friend.
I have always been considered precocious and intellectually gifted and this made connecting with others quite difficult. I get it; my high IQ and intellect intimidates others. But that shouldn’t stop me from finding friends with similar interests. I thought coming to this school would yield a slew of similarly minded acquaintances who I could connect with on a higher intellectual plane. But so far I’ve been met with disappointment as most of the students on my floor are more concerned with burying their faces in their phones instead of attending the latest guest lecture at LeConte Hall.

Being exposed to her religion and embedding myself in the community, I further distanced myself from religious faith.

Furthermore, there existed explicitly sexist and oppressing values. For instance, women have significantly less control over their marriages, according to this particular religious text.
I feel guilty not only because I diverged from my own beliefs, but for tricking this poor girl into thinking I believed in hers. I actually thought I could change her to view things from a logical, independent standpoint. She would get angry if I even questioned the wording of her texts. I understand religion grounds people in terms of values, but can't these values be taught without obviously false pretenses? I'm sorry to anyone religious and reading this, but it's bullshit. We made these systems during a time of lesser technology and understanding of our universe. I don't know how anyone could believe otherwise. People claim that religion fits into science, but it doesn't, and the progression of technology is making this more and more apparent. The evolution of mankind is drowing out these voices day by day.
I was a shit person for lying my way into a relationship and religion for a girl I genuinely loved. But am I really a shit person for trying to give her perspective, which she refuted? Her parents oppressed her so much that she refused to believe anything else out of fear. She was defensive of beliefs she couldn't even back up. And now I'm afraid a person I once loved will live the entirety of their life under fear and control, just because people can't exist without a moral code founded on falsehood.","3255.

We made these systems during a time of lesser technology and understanding of our universe. I don't know how anyone could believe otherwise. People claim that religion fits into science, but it doesn't, and the progression of technology is making this more and more apparent. The evolution of mankind is drowing out these voices day by day.
I was a shit person for lying my way into a relationship and religion for a girl I genuinely loved. But am I really a shit person for trying to give her perspective, which she refuted? Her parents oppressed her so much that she refused to believe anything else out of fear. She was defensive of beliefs she couldn't even back up. And now I'm afraid a person I once loved will live the entirety of their life under fear and control, just because people can't exist without a moral code founded on falsehood.",,1563116401,,,89,25,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2407908022818955&id=2156420374634389,

Because i realized that i don't remember his face anymore, i forgot his birthday, i forgot his voice, i forgot how many years since he passed away, i almost even forgot his name. The more i think about how much i've forgotten him, the more i felt guilty. i loved grandpa since i can remember as a little kid and i know that he loved me too but why am i forgetting him now? i don't know who's fault it is anymore but i just hate myself and i hate time too and i hate the fact that he isn't here anymore. He won't be able to see my accomplishments and my funniest stories of the day. He won't be able to know that his granddaughter has grown so much and got into Berkeley, one of the best schools in the world. i have so many things that i did that im so proud of that i can't share with him anymore.
Since that day, i've never dreamed of grandpa. i remembered myself used to pray sometimes for him appearing in my dream. At least we can meet and talk, which is what i missed the most. No one knew how much i hated myself when i couldn't fly to your side to see you when you were so ill. No one knew how much i hated myself because i was too young to understand the fact you don't have many days left and that i should've appreciated those moments but i didn't. i also hated myself to not talking to you more often before your voice and consciousness go away. i hated that they didn't tell me about your death until weeks later. i hate that i never said i love you at that time. i hate that i never said thank you for everything you taught me. i hate that i didn't have a chance to say goodbye to you. i just hated myself so much for everything because i hid all these feelings and never told anyone seriously, not even my family.
One day at dinner, your name was brought up. i looked at grandma, her teary eye and broken voice disappeared. i looked at mom, she was eating well and chatting with grandma. i looked at my cousins, they were watching tv. Everything seemed so fine, then i realized that slowly grandpa's name wasn't prohibited anymore. i don't know how i feel about it, did we move on or did we left you behind? is this the best ending for us? is this what happens? or is it just that i'm too cold? So many questions in my head that i can't clear out, but if you were here, then it wouldn't be a problem because you're so smart, you could answer all my questions, you can even make me like math again when i hated it.
i'm just sad that you can't help me answer my questions anymore. i'm just sad that you're not by my side anymore. i'm just sad that i can't talk to you anymore. i'm just sad that this the reality and you're forever gone, grandpa.","3158.

No one knew how much i hated myself when i couldn't fly to your side to see you when you were so ill. No one knew how much i hated myself because i was too young to understand the fact you don't have many days left and that i should've appreciated those moments but i didn't. i also hated myself to not talking to you more often before your voice and consciousness go away. i hated that they didn't tell me about your death until weeks later. i hate that i never said i love you at that time. i hate that i never said thank you for everything you taught me. i hate that i didn't have a chance to say goodbye to you. i just hated myself so much for everything because i hid all these feelings and never told anyone seriously, not even my family.
One day at dinner, your name was brought up. i looked at grandma, her teary eye and broken voice disappeared. i looked at mom, she was eating well and chatting with grandma. i looked at my cousins, they were watching tv. Everything seemed so fine, then i realized that slowly grandpa's name wasn't prohibited anymore. i don't know how i feel about it, did we move on or did we left you behind? is this the best ending for us? is this what happens? or is it just that i'm too cold? So many questions in my head that i can't clear out, but if you were here, then it wouldn't be a problem because you're so smart, you could answer all my questions, you can even make me like math again when i hated it.
i'm just sad that you can't help me answer my questions anymore. i'm just sad that you're not by my side anymore. i'm just sad that i can't talk to you anymore. i'm just sad that this the reality and you're forever gone, grandpa.",,1561420801,,,46,7,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2393690587574032&id=2156420374634389,

There should actually be immediate change to our dining halls because when I first came, things didn't look healthy AND appetizing. So in the end, I valued being “healthy” and I would eat a salad for lunch and dinner. Early on, I stopped using dressing because the ones they had were just incredibly loaded with sugar or I had to use olive oil. The salad bar wasn’t even good. No quinoa, no avocado. I barely got protein without here being good quality chicken or meats. Basically my body was composed of spinach and lacked al my essential nutrients. Again, nothing in the dining hall was appetizing occasionally I would take a little bit of mac n cheese when they had it to indulge. Anyway, this continued for a couple months until my body couldn’t handle it anymore. However, it was not that I switched to eating unhealthier options. I still ate how I was eating with a salad for lunch and dinner but then at night I would binge eat. I post-mated unhealthy food and snacks that satisfied me because I had been depriving my body. It definitely was a downward spiral from there with struggling with bulimia. Fuck UC Berkeley Dining. It’s the worst and I never wanted to struggle with an eating disorder but wow that shit happened.

Like when we aren’t hooking up I don’t think he’s anymore attractive (and conventionally is probably less attractive now) but like as soon as I start touching all the new skin it’s like everything intensifies.

B. Austin Frenes's Chinese is unbelievably good for only having studied less than three years. Like seriously no Chinese to finishing 5th year chinese in two academic years? Really? I remember when I first met him freshman year he could barely even say ni hao and now he's freakin reading hard ass books, watching lectures in Mandarin without subtitles, and confronting people who think they're talking shit. Honestly dude if you're reading this you're fucking admirable, never stop learning and flexing because you've honestly inspired me to go beyond what I learned in chinese school and I hope you help others do the same.
C. My friends, Michlle Fong, Sung Won Seo, and Derek Phan are so cool like I am so blessed that I met them. Like they make me so happy that I came to Cal.
D. Priyanka Raghavan, I admire what a hard-worker you are and how you always stick out a problem till you persevere. Also that you always go out of your way to be kind and help others even if they do not always return the offer. Chem E life can be a bitch, and it pains me to see the fuck ton of pressure that you are under. I want you to know that your hard work is gonna pay off BIG TIME (and already is), and that you are appreciated so much by the people who care about you even if we don't always express it as often as we should. I am here for you, always <3.

A car full of hooligans pull up and starts harassing my friends (guess they know each other?) but my friends just ignore it. They start pulling away and my dumb ass walks up to the window and tells them “Hey it’s not cool to bully girls”. The guy in the back seat calls me a n***er, which is pretty fucked up because I’m not black and he’s some white boi. I happen to have a finished boba in my hand and need to toss it. Realized there’s a trash can full of trash right in front of me, so I toss it in the car window and I guess they got pissed? Five guys step out of the car. They are pulling on my shirt and I’m like fuck that so I started throwing punches. Realized a bit late they were trying to grab at me when I’ve been punching them in the face. Woops. They back off a bit and I realized I’m a fucking idiot. Try to be the bigger man and apologize; they call me a chink (nice) and leave. I’m like cool that’s over, I’m going home.

She's joked about it before but I didn't take it seriously and immediately gave her the benefit of the doubt. Looking back, I feel like that was her way of telling me but I completely didn't interpret it the way I should've. I can't shake the feeling of being disrespected and misled because she could have at least had the decency to start a sit-down conversation before we started fucking.

I don't want to compromise my quality of life and this shit is uncurable. Yes there are meds that can lessen the chance of passing it on to someone else, and god knows if she's taking them, but there's never a guarantee that I won't get infected.

There was definitely an awkward moment, and she pulled away for a second. She then said she was not comfortable with sex on a first encounter, so she gave me a blowjob. I have not heard from her since. She tried to be nice but I could tell it bothered her.
She totally judged me on the size of my penis. I am sure she would have had sex with me given a bigger penis. Women say that we should accept them for who they are, fat, ugly, a man who identifies as a woman, you name it. But because I have a small penis, I am not good enough. Why can't men be accepted regardless of their size?

A. stats' department's Gaston is the worst professor ever. He deducted points for hidden rubric which is not in the assignment nor did he ever mention the requirement in class because he thinks that file is a nature for him to include in a github repo. This disappointed me about Cal and this apartment. He thinks 0.5 % of our grade is not a big deal, and we should be content with the grade we have. Come on, man, it's not about how much he deducts. It's a matter of unfairness and justice. This dude's teaching attitude, ambiguous instructions and arbitrary add-on secret rubrics are really disgusting. Students' voices are not listened, evidence are not accepted as long as it's against his ""nature"".
B. Instructor of stat 133 literally just deducts points for not specified requirement of an assignment, which only shows up on his rubric until the grades were released. What we did was just trying to follow every instruction of a project, whereas the instruction itself is incomplete. Come on man, it's extremely unfair for getting points off no matter how small portion the instructor thinks it's. It means a lot to us, who chose Cal and think it's the best academic community for us until we met this instructor, who talks irrelevant subjects in class, gives ambiguous assignment instructions, does't listen to student's voices, and ignores evidence that he gave us incomplete instruction.

Her boyfriend is a genuinely nice dude and it's really cute seeing them together, grabbing lunch together or waiting for her classes. But when I say ""flirting"" I mean FLIRTING. She goes to parties with me and our group of friends, but she rarely brings her boyfriend with her. It's fine, couples don't have to do everything together, but the way she acts when she's drunk around guys sometimes disgusts me. I drank with her since freshman year, and there's no way I don't know how she normally acts when she's drunk.

One time she didn't tell this guy that she has a boyfriend, so he took it as a yes...My other closest friend and I had to clear things out to get her home safe, and when we took her home, she was sober as fuck. At this point I'm confused at what she's trying to do. I have no intention of telling her boyfriend about her actions or anything, but I can't help feeling bad for that dude. She didn't cheat on him as far as I know, but I know I would not be happy if my boyfriend is flirting/borderline cheating when I'm not there with him.

I dislike boba, anime, raves, and coordinated dancing, and have zero interest in participating in any Asian subcultures. I respect them fully but they're just not my cup of tea. Obviously the things I listed are pretty shallow, but what it comes down to is just that I feel like my race does not make up any of my identity whatsoever.
This isn't meant to be a ""I'm-not-like-the-other-Asians,"" post. However, coming to Berkeley it almost feels like I'm expected to adhere to my racial group and background. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it or if it's very real; I know I definitely did not feel this way in my hometown. I feel like all the Asians stick together here, and if you don't relate to Asian-American or Asian culture it's difficult to feel like you fit in. I've been told by others half a dozen times that I don't ""look"" like a typical Asian either -- my features, the way I dress, etc. and I feel like (I'm not sure if I'm imagining this or not) sometimes other Asians don't want to associate with me just because of that. I'll walk into a room and get glares. I just hate that because I'm Asian there are all these preconceived notions about me that I don't fit. I don't fit in anywhere here. It's driving me a little crazy because again, I'm not sure if I'm just imagining it, or if it's very real.
I've also virtually never experienced the racism that most Asian-Americans complain about. I don't mean this to be an erasure of other people's experiences; I believe them entirely, I'm just often curious as to why I in particular have, for example, never experienced Asian fetishization despite dating many white or latino men. None of them have ever made a pointed comment about my race.
And honestly, when it comes to dating, I'm grateful to be in America. People here always complain that one beauty standard is promoted here, but it's far worse in Asia, where you have to be 80 pounds, pale as shit, and have the same exact set of facial features -- a standard I definitely don't fit. I've literally never been called pretty or been approached by an Asian or Asian-American in my life, but I get told that I am all the time from men of other races. Here in Berkeley, it makes me write off Asian men, not because I'm not into them, but because I feel like they aren't attracted or interested in me at all.
So I don't relate to most of the Asian-American heritage, background, or struggles, and it makes me feel like an outsider all the time in Berkeley where it feels like people are obsessed with race. I'm almost scared of being accused of some form of racism for this confession. I'm not sure if anyone else feels the same way, but if they do, I hope this post helps them realize that they're not alone. And it feels nice to get this off my chest.","2479. I'm Asian-American.

She was so sweet and I started crying so hard I literally couldn't form words. I think I managed to tell her that I just needed time alone, and they left after that.
To those two girls: I don't think I'll ever know who you are, but thank you so much for caring about a complete wreck of a stranger that night. Thank you for making sure that I could get home safely.

2356939817915776,"2464. I feel like a terrible terrible TERRIBLE person for saying this but sometimes I’m embarrassed of being in public with my boyfriend.
Now before I get into the nitty gritty, I want to start off by saying that he’s a great guy and that’s why I’m still with him. He’s extremely supportive, loving, and understanding. He’s been there for me through some very difficult times including the my parents’ divorce. Had he not been there, I would be a complete fucking mess. There’s a lot of things that I genuinely am grateful and love him for BUT whenever we’re in public, I can’t help but feel embarrassed of his appearance.
Ever since we started dating (about a 2.5 years ago) he’s started to gain a bit of weight that has all accumulated in his gut. I’m not the skinniest person out there either so I encourage us to go on rsf dates. Unfortunately, most of the time I end up going alone due to his lack of motivation. Another thing is that he has Eczema, a skin disease that has symptoms of dry skin and rashes. I know that he’s particularly sensitive about it so I have been looking up treatments and ways to help reduce the inflammation. He, on the other hand, has prescribed treatment but hardly takes it unless I remind him to. What ends up happening, is we’ll be getting brunch somewhere, and his face will start bleeding randomly.
Lastly, although I’ve helped him venture out of his wardrobe, he refuses to stop wearing Cal gear. I mean go bears but the man literally only shops at the student store and holy fuck I’m tired of seeing Oski’s face on his chest every time we lay down to cuddle.
I still want to be with him, I just want him to put more effort into his appearance!! I know I’m probably a shallow prick to be saying this but hey that’s why it’s a confession.","2464.

2354799884796436,"2431. I can’t believe there are people at UC Berkeley — one of the TOP SCHOOLS IN THE WORLD! — who still believe that trees exist. One of my closest friends is a botanist, and a few years ago she explained to me that trees were invented a decade or two ago, which has only been confirmed many times from other friends I have in the field. The way it’s been explained to me is that, somewhere in the late 90’s–early 2000’s, it was discovered that the oxygen rate was declining rapidly. Different species of bushes and rocks were hybridized to create the multiple different breeds of trees you can find worldwide. Then, the UN launched a program to plant all these trees within the span of just one year to improve the oxygen rates(I’ve heard a lot of different years, so my information’s a little spotty here, but it was somewhere between 2003–2006). Since then, trees have been crossbred with fungi, flowers, a few omnivorous mammals, and even a few sea creatures to produce the most obedient form of tree that money can create. As soon as someone steps out of the government’s good graces, the trees are activated.
The idea that trees take decades to grow is a myth, too! The saplings, or more accurately “tiny trees,” were planted in that size and just don’t grow, so that the governments can keep perpetuating. I hope this warning goes public, if only to prove that *I* haven’t been consumed by a tree sleeper agent.","2431.

Today, I was in lecture and didn't understand a problem. I asked my friend, who was sitting next to me, and he offered a three word explanation for this problem. Three words was not enough for me to connect the dots. I asked for clarification, and my friend's tone seemed pretty annoyed that I couldn't understand a very simple concept, especially for this question that was very near the beginning of class. It's not his fault I didn't understand -- it's mine. It's not his fault I took his tone so personally -- it's mine. I just wanted to say that it made me feel like shit I guess, and contributed to my feelings of inadequacy. It made me feel like I was unteachable. Like I was annoying. That even though I have friends, I was annoying and a burden when I needed help. And that made me feel like the loneliest person in the world. That I could only turn to myself. But I'm not good enough. Maybe if I was capable of everything, that'd be fine, y'know, I wouldn't have to rely on others. But having my incapable ass try to make myself capable -- I guess a positive word to use would be ""independent"" -- is so lonely.

I was raped when I was ten, and that happened for multiple times throughout three years. I have depression and ptsd that is still affecting my life greatly. It is so frustrating since no one around me can actually understand what is going on, so I don't have a support system when I have flashbacks, nightmares, or get triggered and experience panic attacks.
Part of me wants a relationship, because I sometimes I really want to have someone to talk to and accept me. But the simplest physical contact (friendly pat on the shoulder) freaks me out. My trusting issues cause me to think that everyone wants something from me. It is so hard to establish the boundaries or to tell people that I am uncomfortable. I just really don't want to blame themselves for my issues. And I am afraid that it might pose burden onto other people because they feel obligated to make me feel better.
Whenever someone shows slight interest in me, I get so scared. I don't feel like I deserve it. I think of myself as a broken, rotten, gross and disgusting human being, and the person that I actually am will freak people out. I know that I cannot get into relationships, because I don't want to spread my negative emotions to other people. I don't think there will be anyone that will accept and understand my true self.

2343615972581494,"2253. At the end of 2018 I stopped smoking weed, got back together with my ex, and started being honest with myself and my family. What I learned is that the problems I was avoiding by being a stoner didn't go away, they were getting worse and waiting for me to come back. Weed made me feel good when I had no reason to feel good, and that's why I kept smoking it. Now, when I feel good, I know it's because I've done the emotional labor to create environments that I can feel good in. I don't even like drinking anymore. I actually feel real happiness sober, even in super mundane parts of life like waiting in a grocery store checkout. There's real sadness and other negative feelings too, but that's part of life and those emotions are valuable!
So to those of you who smoke weed and feel like you can't stop: I believe in you. Maybe you're like me and are feeling so many things that you just need something to numb you. I was really far gone: 3-7 joints a day for 3 years, literally couldn't stop buying weed even when I would promise myself ""this is my last joint,"" I broke all the boundaries I had set for myself like ""no being high around family or my partner"" and ""no going to class or work high."" I was the person who would smoke before literally everything. It starts with smoking before a concert, and ends with smoking before going to the park to smoke. I even had to smoke before going to the library! And I fucking love the library!
I didn't get counseling until after I had quit but maybe you need that. What made me quit was seeing the impact of lying and avoiding emotional labor on an older family member. It's no way to live. There is a way to feel better than what weed makes you feel. If I can make it out of the haze you can as well.
I'm a chronic marijuana abuser and addict - I've been sober for 3 months.","2253.

2337711609838597,"2164. I’m not even sure where to start with this cluster fuck of a story that has been my love life for the past few years. I want to preface this with who I am. I am a gay 24-year-old transfer student in their last year here at Cal. As I am getting ready to graduate I feel it’s the right time to share my experience of being in an abusive relationship, with the hope that I can leave it behind here at Berkeley as I move on with my life.
I suppose it starts like any modern relationship story. We met on a dating app in the late spring of 2015. He was finishing his Berkeley sophomore year, and I was a local community college student getting ready to apply to Berkeley. Looking in retrospect, I should have known not to continue to date him. It was the ONLY first date I have ever left thinking that I did not want a second date. He showed up drunk, and was fairly rude and self-centered during the date and he essentially MADE me pay for the date. Somehow, I let him talk me into a second and then third date. Essentially what it turned into was him using me for a free meal and for the use of my truck with getting furniture. I was just in aww of the whole Berkeley thing, and I just went along with it.
Over the course of the summer however, I fell in love with him. Writing his behavior off as “being young and naive”. He introduced me to the freedom that is the college life style, the fun of having college aged friends, and the ability to experience Berkeley as a student. Over the course of the next few months I spent every weekend with him in Berkeley. I grew close with his friends, and became adjusted to what Berkeley was like. It is around this time that things started going downhill.
It began as him re-downloading dating apps after we had made the decision to be exclusive. Then came the mysterious text messages to different guys, the new dick pics of other guys saved on his phone, and then him actively going on date with other guys. I eventually confronted him about it, and he deleted it all, and promised to be better. I was in love with him so I fell for it. Over the course of the year he managed to both build me up and tear me down at the same time. In the beginning it was nice, I had someone to support me with my then current problems, someone who would listen, and give good advice. All the while he was quietly whittling away my self-esteem.
He came from a wealthy family, it was expected for him to go to a good school and to know how to navigate college. I, on the other hand, came from a really poor family in the outskirts of Detroit. Although I didn’t notice it at the time, it was this that allowed him to see himself as better than me. He had the family support to allow him to have nice things, to not work in college, to not have to worry about anything other than school. I on the other hand had to struggle for every little leg I up I got. I worked my ass off over that year to prove to him that I could be just as successful. It however, was never enough for him. He constantly complained about everything I did and who I was. He complained about my cloths, my hair, the way I talked, that I didn’t always have time or the money to do fun things. He set out to change who I was, and I let him.
I gained admissions to Berkeley in the spring of 2016. I was overjoyed. I was going to get to go to such an amazing school. My family was ecstatic as I would be the first person in my family to attend a university with any sort of recognition. I started making plans to move to Berkeley, and to get ready for school. It was around this time that he cheated on me the first time. I called him out on it and his solution was to break up with me.
If I could go back, I would NEVER fight for a relationship with such a manipulative and toxic person, But I was young and in love. I fought tooth and nail to keep him. I made promises that I would change, I would work harder, I would lose weight, and I would dress better, and I would switch my career goals and start the pre-med rout. All that I asked of him was for him to stop talking to other guys.
We got back together and continued dating. With me living in Berkeley during this time and starting my junior year (he was now in his senior year) I had to focus on school. I continued to ignore the signs. I wrote off his talking with other guys as “not really cheating” and his continued destruction of my self-esteem as my fault.
As I tried and failed at premed (something I was not really into) our relationship struggled. We broke up and got back together several more times over the year. As he and his friends graduated Cal, those of us still in the bay area decided to get an apartment together in Oakland ( I decided I would commute to school). He talked me into moving into a place with him that I could not afford. I was still a broke college student and he was making a near 6 figure salary, and he still had parental support on things like rent. I bought our food, and did our laundry, and took care of the apartment all the while driving my-self further and further into debt to take care of him. I had the hopes that he would mutually reciprocate my effort, but he never did.
I was always the one who had to put forward all the effort. He was never really interested in my life, it was always a fight anytime I wanted him to come see my family, or to interact with my friends. Hell, he didn’t even come to my Community College graduation. He would never introduce me to his family, and he was always secretive of our relationship. He never posted picture or stories that included me (something he would do from the beginning with the guy he later cheated on me with), and he even eventually asked me not to come to his Berkeley graduation.
Near the end of the 2018 spring semester, even though we were living together, still sharing a bed, things really started to unravel. He was always off “with other friends” going to parties and on vacations ( I had to pick him up from several “interesting” locations because he didn’t have a car and didn’t want to uber) I suspect he was seriously cheating on me this whole time, but as I have no solid proof I can’t make that statement with certainty. However, come Cal day 2018 I discovered he had started dating another guy (we were still dating and nearing our 3-year anniversary). We had decided to come to Cal day as a group with our friends and instead he brought the other guy. He then proceeded to “borrow” my car so he could go out with the new guy (I did not know about this until later). This was the last straw for me and I decided to move out.
Over this last summer and fall semesters, I was a mess. The Depression and Anxiety I had developed from this mentally, emotionally, and (at times) physically abusive relationship, really affected me. I was un-able to get out of bed, un able to do class work, I almost lost my Job and failed several of my classes.
While I know I should have been stronger, and not put up with his shit, I loved him. I loved him more than I ever thought possible. There was so much good that came out of the 3 years I dated him, but there was much, much more damage. I have virtually 0 self-esteem now, I find it nearly impossible to trust guys I’m dating, and have 0 faith in myself or my decisions.
I know that I was not a perfect boyfriend myself, there were many things I could have improved on. There are times where I still blame myself for everything that happened, “maybe if I worked harder to keep him, maybe if I had been more attentive, maybe then he wouldn’t have done what he did. My friends always tell me that I’m wrong, that it was really him being a toxic, manipulative, and abusive person, but this just doesn’t always feel right.
I’m now working on moving past the trauma of dating him, working on strengthening how I view myself. It’s a long road and I still struggle with the emotional baggage, even as I have met a new guy who treats me so amazing.
I guess the moral of the story is, don’t force something that’s wrong, and never let anyone treat you like less than a person. It’s hard to find the strength to remove yourself from a toxic relationship, and it’s even harder when you still love the person who is abusing you.
To B2 (him) if you are reading this, I will never forgive you. You ruined who I was, you took everything, and never gave in return. My memories of you will always be of the “abusive guy” I dated in college. I truly hope that there is a special place in hell for you, and that you burn for eternity. Even now try to find ways back into my life (after over a year of you continuing to date the guy you cheated on me with) I know that you will never be a good person. I might not be back on my feet yet, but I know that I am a million times the person you will ever be. I trust that Karma will come for you, and you will get what you have coming.","2164. I’m not even sure where to start with this cluster fuck of a story that has been my love life for the past few years. I want to preface this with who I am. I am a gay 24-year-old transfer student in their last year here at Cal. As I am getting ready to graduate I feel it’s the right time to share my experience of being in an abusive relationship, with the hope that I can leave it behind here at Berkeley as I move on with my life.
I suppose it starts like any modern relationship story. We met on a dating app in the late spring of 2015. He was finishing his Berkeley sophomore year, and I was a local community college student getting ready to apply to Berkeley. Looking in retrospect, I should have known not to continue to date him. It was the ONLY first date I have ever left thinking that I did not want a second date. He showed up drunk, and was fairly rude and self-centered during the date and he essentially MADE me pay for the date. Somehow, I let him talk me into a second and then third date. Essentially what it turned into was him using me for a free meal and for the use of my truck with getting furniture. I was just in aww of the whole Berkeley thing, and I just went along with it.
Over the course of the summer however, I fell in love with him. Writing his behavior off as “being young and naive”. He introduced me to the freedom that is the college life style, the fun of having college aged friends, and the ability to experience Berkeley as a student. Over the course of the next few months I spent every weekend with him in Berkeley. I grew close with his friends, and became adjusted to what Berkeley was like. It is around this time that things started going downhill.
It began as him re-downloading dating apps after we had made the decision to be exclusive. Then came the mysterious text messages to different guys, the new dick pics of other guys saved on his phone, and then him actively going on date with other guys. I eventually confronted him about it, and he deleted it all, and promised to be better. I was in love with him so I fell for it. Over the course of the year he managed to both build me up and tear me down at the same time. In the beginning it was nice, I had someone to support me with my then current problems, someone who would listen, and give good advice. All the while he was quietly whittling away my self-esteem.

2329736003969491,"2052. Before college, I used to be bullied a ton because of my physical appearance. Classmates would call me ""wimpy"" or ""bony"" because of my skinniness. Often, people would ask me if I was anorexic. Throughout high school, I felt alone. I felt like people were disgusted.
Coming to college, I never thought I would find love. I did not expect it, nor I did I think about being friends with a girl. Somehow, I met this girl last semester. Unexpectedly. I was at one of the Dwinelle benches when she was coming out of the building. She had her head down and was smiling. When she was about to sit down next to me, she started laughing. i got nervous. I thought she was laughing at me. But she told me her closest friend sent her a bunch of memes during class. She showed me a few. Her smile and laugh caught my attention. I'm sure she noticed. She stopped laughing and introduced herself. She asked me about myself and if I had class there. I told her I had a class in an hour. She said, "" Im going to Golden Bear Cafe for a scantron. If you're still here, I will join you."" I told her that I can go with her. She just smiled. That's how it all started. That whole hour we got to know each other through humor. She somehow made me feel human again. We exchanged social media information. That day, she reached out to me. We soon became friends and always hung out.
Just in days of hanging out with her, I knew she was the one. Months later, I asked her out. She said yes. I did not expect her to say ""yes"", I was actually ready for rejection. When she said yes, I asked her why. She looked at me confusingly and quickly noticed that I was serious. She told me to sit down, then proceeded to give me a speech. It was beautiful. From there, she always reassured me of my value. She told me how attractive I was in every way. Unfortunately, I became too obsessed with her. She started expressing discomfort. One day, she told me that maybe we needed a break. Nothing happened then, we were still technically ""together"".
A week later, I went up to her and told her we indeed needed a break. She said she did not mind, and agreed to it. I was mad; I wanted her to oppose the break. I proceeded to block her on all my social media accounts and talked shit about her to my floormates. She was aware of all of this. I just thought she was probably seeing someone else and was over me. She wasn't. A few weeks later, we talked one night. I blamed all my problems on her and even started pointing out her flaws. She did visit me a few times after, to work things out as friends, but I always gave her a hard time. I didn't realize the damaged I had made until some time later when a mutual friend told me that she had to go to counseling because of me.
I hate how I did this to her. I still see her on campus, but she always walks right past me. I lost the only girl to ever fall in love with me, the one who saw past my physical appearance. I still think about her a lot. she's the only person I have fallen in love with, and most likely the last relationship I will experience. I doubt I will find someone like her. I do have her on social media again, and I often visit her profiles. I miss her laugh and smile.

At first he was pretty chill but then he just turned into a total douche, always trying to give us hickeys and trying to fuck with us. He's also one of those guys who constantly say they got 2 standard deviations above the curve and then say he did bad.
I think what set me off the edge was when I went home over the weekend during first semester and when I came back I learned that he brought a girl over and slept with her on my bed. Not only that but he denied it and continues to deny it to this day.
Now fast forward to last week and not much has happened since I had been avoiding him, but he decides to walk into our room while I'm trying to study. He proceeds to mess with me by spraying me with a pressure air duster, which was already annoying enough BUT he proceeds to start messing with the shit on my desk, and this is including the fact that no one in our room invited him, he just walked in. Now I'm chill with people messing with me but when they start messing with my shit, that's the last straw. I told him to leave but he didn't so I walked out for a couple minutes to calm down and came back into the room. I don't know if he's just mentally retarded or if he can't read people's emotions but a minute after I get back, he pretends to throw some of my shit out the window and at this point he's just asking to get punched in the face but I turned around at the last moment and punched a wall instead. My knuckles were completely fucked up so I took an uber to the nearest urgent care center, and he decided to join me because he felt bad or something. In the car I straight up tell him he's not coming back inside our room but this fucker had the balls to say ""no, I'm coming back in the room"". Like bruh fuck off already.
I gave up on arguing with him and things died down for a couple of days. I went back home again this past weekend.

bye","1858. I don’t know why I’m here, why I’m at this school. It's a miracle that I have any friends considering how many people detest me here. I had to deal with hundreds of harassment accusations every semester, day in and day out. Heck, I just want to fucking pass my classes and run far away once I have my degree. I can't even go through the movements of school or life without being bombarded and ambushed by those who deny my humanity.
I’m wasting my parents hard-earned money. I’m wasting space in this school by creeping out everyone just through my existence. Someone else could’ve gotten in instead of me. Someone with passable social skills and over 9,000 times as shy as I am. Bet this hellhole wants me thrown in prison now and regrets ever receiving my application.

2318001465142945,"1849.5. I am the same OP who posted a confession about my URAP experience. I just want to thank everyone for all the wholesome comments. I realized that many people were able to relate to me, and I am very grateful for the people who suggested internships and their experiences. I think it definitely takes time to attain your goals, so I think being patient can be very rewarding.
Update:
I applied for another research position at UCSF, and I got an offer for an interview request. I just came back from the interview today, and I must say that it was definitely an unique and a different experience. The post-docs were very nice people, and they gave me a tour of the lab. They didn't ask me why I went to a community college, and most importantly, they did not interrupt me when I described my research experience to make a racial comment about my last name. In fact, one of the post-docs was very interested about my lab experience because he had done the same lab work when he was doing his post-doc, and I had done the same research as an undergraduate at a local community college.
I don't know how things will turn out, but it was nice and refreshing to talk to people who are really passionate about research and learning about what the undergraduates have to offer. Even though they realized that I may not have wet lab experience, they were impressed by my willingness to learn. Personally, I think it was refreshing to see that they made me feel welcomed and made me feel like I belong there.
So yeah, thank you for the support, and I think everyone made me feel motivated to try again. I think sometimes, I forget that small failures or small setbacks are necessary to keep me in check and become better and grow as a person. I remember when I was young, my dad would always tell me a story about how once there was a great warrior who felt defeated during the battle and decided to hide in a cave in the Himalayan mountains. He was tired and hungry from fighting vigorously. Since he did not have anything to do, he became curious and began to look around at the dark weary walls. He then saw an ant carrying a grain of rice, and the ant was trying to crawl with it to the other side of the wall. However, the grain of rice would fall down. The ant crawled back to the place where the grain of rice had fallen and picked up the grain of rice. The ant crawled again with the grain of rice to go on its journey to the other side of the wall. The ant was very determined to achieve its goal that the ant did this over again and again for thirty times. The warrior had learned an important lesson that even if we have to face challenges, we need to try our best and never lose hope. The courageous warrior went back to the battle feeling undaunted and diligent towards winning the battle. In fact, he won the battle and even became the king.
Although I do not want to be king, I feel that this story still really inspires me. But everyone who commented about their experiences also really encouraged me, and I really appreciate it. <3","1849.5. I am the same OP who posted a confession about my URAP experience.

I thought I saw you on campus today walking up the steps of MLK. But it hit me a second later that you are not actually here on this earth anymore. When you passed in October, I struggled to comprehend what was happening simply because I always thought I would be able to reach out to you and tell you how much I liked you the next time that I saw you.
Of course, that phrase ""next time"" is still haunting me to this very day.
I delayed every second to say ""hi, let's grab dinner or a coffee"" and I delayed every second to reach out to you and tell you how much I admired you. Always working, always at the gym, always grinding - I was intimidated by the schedule that you functioned on and used it as an excuse to say that I'll just have to wait until a slot would open up for me to swoop in and build precious memories on.
Fuck, I wish I wasn't such a coward.
Instead, I wasted my time messing around with someone that looked just like you and gave off a similar vibe. But no matter how many times I interacted with this person, it just wasn't you. It's my fault for even trying to replace you with someone else. I should've known that no one would be able to replace the person that is so uniquely you. Your charisma, your unexpectedly adorable smile, your sentimental thoughts, and your desire to succeed to honor your mother - thinking about you still brings tears to my eyes. I miss seeing you here.
I regret not ever telling you that I like you. And that I think I could've loved you with the rest of my heart and for a very long time, David Lim.
But what I grieve about most is that you're not alive. I hate that you're not alive.","1784. CW: Death of a student

I’ve been single since I came to Cal (well, sorta. My longest Cal relationship was 6 months, so effectively single) and I’ve seen a lot. I was assaulted by my 61a project partner and solicited by enough homework group members freshman year that I did all my work (except my 61b projects, god bless my lovely best friend and female project partner; and 16b and 61c labs/projects due to my lovely and brilliant and, coincidentally, gay male lab/project partners for those classes) alone. That includes all homeworks in 16a/16b, as well as almost all 61a projects and hws. This was extremely isolating. My only real friend in my major was the aforementioned female project partner, and I didn’t want to keep trying to make friends and be included in hw groups if it meant having to rebuff sexual advances while concurrently being belittled and not taken seriously. I found good people later sophomore year, but only after a really long and lonely slog through the eecs lower divs. All the while, I’ve seen numerous friends or other girls get drugged at parties or otherwise get taken advantage of by highly manipulative partners or online, get assaulted or harassed on Bart or on the street, and even found several girls i didn’t know in extremely compromising positions (exposed and unconscious) and had to figure out who to call to get all of them home and safe and comfortable. Why the FUCK don’t guys have to deal with this? Or, actually, i take that back. I don’t want anyone to have to do this, so why have I had to do so much of it??? I’ve lost so many hours of sleep due to getting people out of these bad situations, and don’t get me wrong, I’d do it again in a fucking heartbeat, but this isn’t fucking parity. The only people I know who haven’t had to deal with this to this extent are girls with bfs they’ve had since pretty much the start of college who don’t ever go out among strangers alone. How fucked up is that, that even here in the US you need a male chaperone to be safe?
But yeah, i repeat, THERE IS NO PARITY. Please y’all, try to understand that the reason the common understanding that “girls mature faster” exists is because of shit like this, and have a little extra empathy for the shit the women you know may have seen or experienced and aren’t telling you about.
P.S.: this is only vaguely related, but i thought it was important too—It’s also surprisingly hard to be the only female person among your coworkers—i thought this was dumb and a myth until it wasn’t true anymore for me, but the unconscious burden of representation is non-negligible.","1759.

Yep, your heard me. The curved classes are not deflation because grades are not increasing in value over time. Nor is there any indication that higher grades are getting more valuable. Contrast this with grade inflation, which would mean that more and more people get A’s with time so that the value of getting an A diminishes. Curved classes are more like the gold standard because they make sure the value of an object is maintained over time. I understand that grades matter for you all. After all, your livelihood may very well depend on it. But your frustration is misdirected.
Don’t blame Berkeley.
Blame the capitalist system for its structural need for profit, enhanced by the indebtedness which it has brought upon itself by believing in infinite growth on our finite planet. Blame the unwavering pursuit of productivity and growth, leading to fierce competition for the utmost productive workers, who are richly rewarded. Blame the system predicated on competition that must inevitably result in losers as there can be only a handful of workers who are ‘the most’ productive.
Instead, aspire to bring about a world in which your value is not solely determined by the productivity of your labor. A world in which our sole job is to better ourselves and the rest of humanity. A world in which society ensures that each one of us can pursue our full potential.

I'm a Christian and I want to love God and find intimacy in my relationship with Him first before I enter into a relationship with someone else. But at the same time I feel like I've been drifting further away from my community and running away from God. As a result, I've been trying to fill my longing for intimacy from other places like hooking up, and I've just been numbing myself by constantly finding ways to be distracted. And I already feel like some people will say just screw God and religion because it's not letting me live the way I want. But deep down I know my greatest fulfillment and joy came from God and it's just that it's been really hard trying to find that again. Like literally I feel like I'm living a double life: being all wholesome on the outside but at the same time wanting to just be an F boy and hoe around. Like one part of me knows it's probably better for me to reach out for help within the church, but then there's another part of me that wants to use this as a platform to ask if anyone is looking for a friend with benefits.
Welp at least this rant might give a little perspective on what Christians go through inside from time to time and show that just because you're Christian doesn't mean you have everything put together. We're just like any other person trying to discover our sense of identities and purpose in this nebulous world.","1664. I'm really conflicted right now.

2304143399862085,"1649. This is not a rip on media studies. This has been weighing very heavily on me and I just want to share my experience.
TLDR: Asian guy lies to family about being STEM but is actually declared humanities.
_______________________________________________________________________________
When I transferred here all my friends were undeclared CS and naturally their sphere of influence led me to 61A. I did not make it past the first midterm. The next semester I tried again and got much further, but still I failed.
Being Asian definitely did not help my situation. My family thinks I'm going to be at some big tech company generating a six figure income. This pressure to succeed has utterly destroyed me. After failing to pass 61A twice I declared media studies because it was the only thing I qualified for and would allow me to graduate on time. At that point I knew I would be a disgrace to my family. I have yet to tell them the truth.
Prior to this I used to look down on media studies majors. Now that I am one, I have developed an immense amount of empathy towards the humanities. That does not mean I'm proud of it, in fact, I rather not mention it.
When people ask what major I am my reply is always met with awkward silence, a head nod, or a forced ""oh, cool"" but I can tell what they are thinking. These reactions are especially common among STEM folk. You can see it in their faces, ""Media studies... oh... unemployment."" For the most part, there is some truth to it so I can't really blame them. The vast majority of media studies students don't have high salary jobs lined up. The major itself is very theoretical and not very practical, it is even mentioned on the department website. Yes, there is always that ONE person who someone scrapes their way into a big tech company but if they can do it as media studies they deserve it. They truly are an exception.
""But if they can do it, why can't you?"" STOP. Just. Stop. We all have our limits. That's the equivalent of me saying, ""Jimmy goes to Harvard and works for Amazon and made 300,000 tradings stocks last week, why can't YOU be like him? What's stopping YOU?""
Not all of us can work for Google. Not all of us can go to Harvard. Not everyone can get into Berkeley. We all have our places.
As for the dating scene I am at a complete disadvantage, well... on paper that is. I always hear girls around school talk about how wet they are for EECS or Haas. ""Mr. Apple Intern is soooooo hot"" ""Omg he works at Deloitte???"" ""Humanities?? HAHAHA ewww no."" Yes, I admit I am jealous. I wish my major had the same allure.
To make up for this factor I tried out for a consulting group where the founder was also media studies and was once in my shoes getting rejected from every other club. Ironically, the group is now filled with EECS and Haas, and yes, I got rejected. LOL. Fuck it. I can't even be sad about this anymore. It's happened so many times it's just funny now. At this point I have lost all motivation to try. Berkeley is very unforgiving to anyone who isn't at the top of the major heirarchy.
Despite my experience there are some good things to say about media studies.
- A lot of kids go into marketing. So I guess there's that.
- There are for some reason a large amount of international kids in the major, I've noticed a lot of korean girls and just girls in general. In all my classes the guys are a complete minority group. If you're a stud you know what to do.
- You literally study memes and emojis in MS101.
- The faculty is incredibly nice and caring. I cannot count how many times the advisors have saved me.
There are probably more but I cannot recall right now.
There you have it. My media studies experience. It honestly feels better to have let it out even though this might not get posted. I still panic when someone asks about my major. Please don't judge others so harshly. Thank you for reading.","1649. This is not a rip on media studies. This has been weighing very heavily on me and I just want to share my experience.

2304142076528884,"1645. I’m going to come right out and say it: I voted for Donald Trump, and so did many other students at Cal. I’m also planning on voting for him again in 2020.
Part of the reason for that? Berkeley has shown me the ugliest side of “leftist” culture. For a university that prides itself on the exchange of ideas, it’s shameful how quick this university, its professors, and its various student organizations are to shut down opposing viewpoints. From the violent protests that erupt every time a conservative speaker comes to campus, to the the constant hammering-in of left-wing propaganda from official college mouthpieces, Berkeley is no place for free speech.
Guess what? I support economic deregulation, strong border security, thorough vetting of immigrants, gun rights, and private-sector solutions to healthcare. So do 60 million+ Americans. Believing in conservative ideals doesn’t make us “fascists” or “bigots,” no matter how much you all try to claim it does. Trump is by no means my top-choice candidate - in fact, I think he’s kind of a jackass - but I agree (along with most conservatives) with much of his policy platform, and therefore I voted for him.
My advice to liberals? Stop believing you have a monopoly on the “moral high ground” - you don’t. Stop indulging in this delusion that your crusade focused on “safe spaces” and “microaggressions” and “cultural appropriation” is taken seriously anywhere sixty miles from San Francisco. The VAST MAJORITY of Americans have as much derision and disdain for that intellectually dishonest drivel as I do.
And most of all, please stop shutting out your fellow students, friends, and colleagues for having different political opinions than you. College is a time to explore different viewpoints - not to shut yourself up in an echo chamber.","1645.

It's only doing it for the sake of doing it to mix up your day. One can only take so much rote shuffling back and forth and writing code/doing parts. I'm not sure how to inject fun or a sense of joie de vivre when deadlines are pressing or when there is pressure to get jobs/into grad school or when there is grade pressure since if I ignore these pressures, then I fall behind in the Berkeley class since everyone else is obeying these pressures.

I can't remember when was the last time someone looked at me that way. We must have looked at each other for a good two seconds before I smiled lightly at her and continued my work. She continued to do this to me possibly a dozen times, switching between her school work and fidgeting around in her seat, crossing and uncrossing her legs, flicking her back with her neck while looking at me from behind her hair locks like a rabid animal transfixed with a piece of raw meat. We continued to make long eye contacts without exchanging words. I wasn't sure if she wanted to jump on me or kill me. After half an hour or so, it was beginning to become so overbearing that it was distracting me from my studies, although I wasn't entirely displeased. Deciding to prioritize my studies, I began to pack up to leave and find somewhere else to study. Since the library was completely silent, I decide to write my name and phone number on a piece of scratch paper to hand to her. As I approach her desk, I offer the piece of paper in my hand. Without making eye contact with me, she looks at the paper in my hand and whispers ""thank you"" as she takes it and sets it next to her school materials on her desk. I walk out of the library moderately stunned at the mostly silent transaction that had just occurred. She never contacted me.","1597.

After half an hour or so, it was beginning to become so overbearing that it was distracting me from my studies, although I wasn't entirely displeased. Deciding to prioritize my studies, I began to pack up to leave and find somewhere else to study. Since the library was completely silent, I decide to write my name and phone number on a piece of scratch paper to hand to her. As I approach her desk, I offer the piece of paper in my hand. Without making eye contact with me, she looks at the paper in my hand and whispers ""thank you"" as she takes it and sets it next to her school materials on her desk. I walk out of the library moderately stunned at the mostly silent transaction that had just occurred. She never contacted me.",,1549679400,,,81,17,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2300794620196963&id=2156420374634389,

And I really want to do a lot with my best friend by my side, but I can't. Her boyfriend is gay, but she does not know that. I went to a party once and saw him making out with another guy. I have a lot of our mutual friends come to me complaining about how they can't see said friend because her boyfriend is so needy for her. I would describe him as a child always needing to be with his mommy. HE IS ALWAYS WITH HER. And I am not sure if she enjoys it all the time. I feel like he emotionally manipulates her, and because he does not have any friends of his own, he spends all his time with her. Before I leave school, I want to have the guts to tell her why I didn't want to room with her after freshman year...IT WASN'T because I wanted to live close to BART, it was because your boyfriend is actually insane, and is using you as a beard. I was in a triple during my freshman year, and one of my roommates was never there, but I spent quite a bit of time in my dorm room. But every single time that I would come back from class, he would be there. Like didn't he or she understand that I did not want to see his face every single second of the day. Sometimes I would legit just stay in my dorm and get croads to bring it to my dorm just so that he wouldn't come in. It was completely rude of her to think that I wanted to see him all the time, or that when I walked into the room, I would love to see them cuddling. No, its gross. I get it you guys have sex, but do you really have to lay there after the sex for that long and only get up when I come back home. Yes, they are actually laying post sex in the bed when I walk in. I actually went to 61a lecture, that's how much I hated being in the dorm with him there too. So bestie, if you are reading this, I just want to let you know that your boyfriend is using you as a cover. That you are not in a healthy relationship, and that sometimes you have to do things for yourself and not for him. And also, think about the people around you. We are 22, and your boyfriend still can't sleep without being cuddled.","1586. I am currently a senior about to graduate, so I thought I don't really have anything to lose at this point.

If someone were to ask me what makes me interesting or special, I honestly couldn’t tell them. The other day, I was with some friends of mine, and I made a joke. One of my friends was surprised and answered that my joke was actually funny. This got me thinking that maybe my friends see me as a really dull person. I struggle with talking to new people because I can’t think of anything interesting to talk about, and I probably come off as robotic and generic to most people I come across. I feel like when I’m with my friends, it wouldn’t really make a difference if I was there or not, like my presence is so minimal that it’s as if I’m not even there. I enjoy the presence of my friends a lot, and I’m truly grateful for them, but I’m not sure they can truly say the same about me. I can’t help but think that the people I’ve met will eventually leave me behind and forget about me because of the minimal impact I’ve made on their lives. I wonder if people would notice if I disappeared or whether or not my disappearance would even change anything from their day to day lives. This is probably why I don’t have a significant other or a bustling social life. If I died (which I don’t plan to anytime soon), how long would it take for people to move on from me? Would they have any memories of me, or would I just be a blur in their minds? I guess the only person I can really blame is myself for being so uninteresting, but I don’t really know how to fix it.","1574.

2296028124006946,"1524. On October 30 I was walking by the campanile while on the phone with my mom when she decicded it would be a great time to tell me that someone really important to me had died. I thought I was ok for a second and then it hit me. I started freaking out and crying really loudly. I was panicked, sobbing, saying “Are you serious?” “When did it happen!?” “Why are you telling me this?” “No. No. No.” “How did this happen!?” “You can’t be serious!” “Why” “No. No. PLEASE NO!”
It was awful. I was alone. Crying. Crouched down on the sidewalk on the middle of campus. I wanted someone to be there, anyone. As much as I was embarrassed to be making a scene I needed someone to take me out of it.
Someone did. A few different groups of guys came up, genuinely concerned, and asked me if I was ok, what was going on? They stayed for a second to make sure I was ok. One gave me some words of comfort. Even after I walked away -still crying - people who had seen me came up to make sure I was ok.
Hearing that news was absolutely awful. But I want those guys to know how much I appreciate what they did. I’m sure I looked crazy. Like maybe I had just found out I did terrible on a test or something and was overreacting. They must have felt so awkward coming up to me, some random hysterical girl on campus. But fuck, they did anyway and I will never forget that.
So thank you. So much. I can’t imagine how the situation looked; I know I would have felt so uncomfortable, but it means so much to me that all these random students wanted to make sure I was ok.
Anyway, I am ok. She was very old. But she was very special to me it was quite unexpected news on an otherwise normal call with my mom. (“Oh! That reminds me... I have some bad news...”) I definitly didn’t expect some random bros to be the ones who came up to me if anyone did, but thank you. Thank you so much. I know just going up to someone and asking, “Are you ok?” might be awkward, and it might not seems like a big deal, but it made a huge difference to me and is something I will be forever greatful for.","1524.

I felt like I had the audacity to call myself a nice and compassionate person even though I blew you off when you were just trying to meet new people. The stupidest thing is I struggle to meet people and wold LOVE to make new friends. Well long story short, I got of facebook and social media for a while, but now I'm back on and wanted to confess.

I knew her very very well in the past which is why I'm nearly certain and this sickens me, but the truth has to be known. She a) is not in the organization she claims to be in and b) was not assaulted by the man she took great care to 'out'. She has had a personal conflict with the man in question for a while and has publicly tried to defame him before both within the CS community and within her own organization. As someone who knows her and a lot of her friends, I can say that she has lied about being attacked or victimized by other people she has conflict with in the past (and many of her former friends know this too). It was my first thought when I read the post, and many of my friends (who used to be close to her) suspected the same.
The post was impeccably written clearly geared towards the mob mentality of the Berkeley community (obviously worked gauging the reaction). The 'details' about the club she mentioned are public information (eg. retreat location, his position in the club) and as someone who was formerly close to the man in question, she definitely had no issue getting those details. The post was clearly and precisely targeted towards one person (and this was very obvious to both the organization mentioned and his friends in general). And now that person is most likely going to be ostracized by his friends and ousted by his own organization even though I doubt there is any sort of evidence.
Sexual assault is a huge issue on campuses all around the world. I've heard about it happening in many student organizations on campus, many of which are actually buried. But that does not mean that every account posted on an anonymous confession page must be factual. I really really hope that people are able to see this because this person has basically ruined this man's life over something that he did not do.

My gpa is above 3.5 and I can easily apply for grad school later. I should be able to pay most of my debt by this time nexy year. In many ways I am a successful output of the system.
But let me tell you: I feel nothing. I should be happy, and thankful, but I only feel emptiness. Its like a hard game that you finish: there is a thrill throughout the whole game and you are excited to finish it but once you actually get there, you are like oh, well, now what? whats the next thing? To be honest, if commencement was tomorrow I would just sleep in and not go.
I love my major and for the most part, I enjoyed learning the stuff I know and I have no regrets, but I now I keep thinking that all of that knowledge, passion and desire will essentially be boiled down to a paycheck and a 401k: a regular job which I will be doing for the next 5-10 years or so.
I suspect that most people have the exact same feeling but they are too terrified to express it, because its so nihilistic. Thats why every company will try hard to convince you that what they do is somewhat good for the world and you are saving the world by developing their product. They are just trying to replace that nihilism with a passion to work for them and generate more money, and people convince themselves of it because they are terrified of what they might be feeling otherwise. The output is that people get drowned in work without really knowing where they are going or what they are doing.","1447. Im an eecs major and I am graduating next semester.

I love my major and for the most part, I enjoyed learning the stuff I know and I have no regrets, but I now I keep thinking that all of that knowledge, passion and desire will essentially be boiled down to a paycheck and a 401k: a regular job which I will be doing for the next 5-10 years or so.
I suspect that most people have the exact same feeling but they are too terrified to express it, because its so nihilistic. Thats why every company will try hard to convince you that what they do is somewhat good for the world and you are saving the world by developing their product. They are just trying to replace that nihilism with a passion to work for them and generate more money, and people convince themselves of it because they are terrified of what they might be feeling otherwise. The output is that people get drowned in work without really knowing where they are going or what they are doing.",,1548383400,,,215,66,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2290691301207295&id=2156420374634389,

I can tell he loves me. I write this confession because I know he will never read this, since he avoids social media for religious/personal reasons.

...
At Berkeley, I met so many different kinds of people, and while my faith in Him is still strong and I want to be a good person, I can't help but to think about the toxic ways the church has shaped my thinking - how I used to and others in my community still think of homosexuals and transgenders; or how our missions in poor countries, while beneficent and humanitarian, are washing away their culture - which is conflicting to me, because I too want them to know the Father's word. He clearly disapproves of some of my friendships with these people, but has never stopped me from seeing these friends occasionally, when I want to. He did ask me to be careful, because he thinks one of my friends thinks of me as ""pet-project"" and is trying to brainwash me; I disagree, and although I think his intentions are always for my best, I felt strange, I can't put into words why. All of my friends believe, and lately I have found my most inspiring conversations about the Lord has been with these friends, though he doesn't know. Yet I still feel I can never and don't want to be like or live a life like these friends. I try not to think they might go to hell, because I no longer want to assume my faith is the only one that can be right, even if it is right for me. I don't know if I would want my friends to change and be unhappy. These are good people, doing good things for this world too.
For the last year I have been thinking about these things, and feeling lonely. If I speak up I might loose my community or sound like I have gone crazy and loose their respect. What if I am losing faith? What will this mean for my marriage? Is my self-image a facade?
Because of his grades and test scores, he will not get into any medical schools. I just know it and I think he does too, but is denial about it. He has started talking about moving and having children right away and finally going on missions together. But I know I will get into medical school, this is my dream since 4th grade, but he is not the one who is supposed to follow me and I can't leave him. I know it is my job to bear children, but I am also not ready. I know missions are important and the best way to give back to my church and the world. I am selfish and awful for even thinking about divorce. I am incredibly privileged, what I have, many women want to have, and my sisters are constantly telling me how they wish they had found a nice man from a good supportive family, how they are afraid they will get old and not find one, how we are role-models for them, even some of the married ones. His friends constantly tell him how lucky he is, too. Even if I left, I cannot go back to my family, and I will become a pariah, I will be damned by Him, and I'm so afraid even these thoughts mean I am damned. Maybe he is right I am being brainwashed.

I'm sorry this is long but I need to get this all off my chest at once. It all started our freshman year, when we lived in Unit 1. That was when I met Irving. He was a great guy- still is, really. We were in a R1A together and we got together to study all the time. Late one night after the study lounges closed, we were reading in his room, when his roommate came home from practice. Meeting Nately that night was the first time I understood what tall, dark, and handsome meant. As I know now, both of them talked about liking me, but Irving was always just a friend. When he tried to make a move, I just couldn't bring myself to reciprocate. When I finished my last final that semester I went straight to Irving's room to celebrate, but he had finished earlier in the week and the only one in the room was Nately. Long story short: we hung out, one thing led to another, and we hooked up that night. Since we were both friends with Irving and didn't want to hurt him, we kept it to ourselves for the whole break. But when we started dating, it never came up and now, almost exactly two years later, we never found the right time to tell him. It all came crashing down in December. Nately and I had been fighting and we decided to break up. I had nobody to turn to- my closest friend didn't even know about our relationship. But I guess when I dropped off the map for a week, Irving asked my roommate and found out about the whole thing. He stopped talking to me. When I went home I broke down in front of my high school friends. They dragged me out of bed to a club for New Years Eve. I was so trashed I don't remember exactly what happened- the countdown, then someone grabbed and kissed me, and next thing I know we were hooking up in his car. I never got his name. It's been two weeks, and I took a pregnancy test. It turned up positive. I don't even know if it's his or Nately's. I don't know how my life got to this point.

2288404328102659,"1415. To be absolutely honest, seeing 200+ likes on post #993 broke my heart because it was evidence that proved the ignorance of many individuals in a place where I truly believed people were able to think critically. If we are to examine this individual's unsupported claims, it is crucial to look at evidence rather than just accept what he or she said as truth. I want to preface this by stating that I mean not to offend anyone who agrees with the post below but rather, I proceed because I believe that the discourse is necessary. I am also apologizing in advance as I may know the original poster on a personal level so recognize that my aim here is not to criticize you as an individual but to dismantle some beliefs that were stated in ignorance. Perhaps you don’t care and given that is the case, I suggest you to stop reading. If you want to live life with authenticity and truth, regardless of how unpleasant the reality may be, then I invite you to read on. Let me start by supporting the statement that white-bashing is never appropriate. Race-bashing is never appropriate under any circumstances. That being stated, please take into account what we consider ""white-bashing"" and racial jokes surrounding white privilege has primarily arisen in the last few decades, whereas discrimination against non-white races has been tolerated for centuries. Neither are acceptable but perhaps we must then consider why we are so eager to come into savior-mode against white-bashing and racism against white people whereas in normal day-to-day contexts, it is also necessary to contemplate whether or not we are equally enthusiastic in standing up for those that face micro or macro-discrimination as racial minorities. The concept of ""white privilege"" was coined in 1965 during the Civil Rights Movement by a man named Theodore Allen. One Harvard-grad researcher illustrated her own opinions on the subject as a white person, stating that prior, ""as a white person, I realized I had been taught about racism as something which puts others at a disadvantage, but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects, white privilege which puts me at an advantage"". I strongly believe that the quote reflects the case for a lot of us in positions comparable to hers. That is how we want to see racial relations-that if I'm not a racist, not discriminating actively, treating all races as equals, then I should not ever have to dwell on the idea of white privilege because there's nothing I am actively infringing upon. The researcher above, McIntosh, then expresses, ""I think whites are carefully taught not to recognize white privilege, as males are taught not to recognize male privilege. So I have begun in an untutored way to ask what it is like to have white privilege. I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets that I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was “meant” to remain oblivious. White privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools and blank checks."" Keep in mind that this was written in the early 90's so why has white privilege still remained such a sensitive topic? Why is it still the white elephant in the room? In reality, the honest answer is that maybe there is complacency with the status quo on both sides, maybe we believe equality can never be truly achieved, or maybe we buy into the false lies that white privilege matters very little as post #993 claims. A. Just as the individual focused on the importance of education, racial minorities are raised with the strong conviction that racial disparities are made equal through education. We have been convinced that the American Dream is an equal opportunity for those that work hard and if we are to put in effort, we can get anywhere we want to be. This mentality is what so many Asian American who may have grown up with in “tiger homes” and what so many African Americans or Hispanics who may have grown up in less than ideal places are conditioned to believe. (Note that I am stating “may have” for those scenarios above because those are generalizations and not applicable to all.) Unfortunately, this belief puts race out of the question and prioritizes the heavy misconception that education is the only factor that matters. The truth is that education does not equalize inequalities based around racial privileges. Research that Duke University compiled has illustrated that ""on average, a black household with a college-educated family head has less wealth than a white family whose family head did not even obtain a high school diploma"". ""White households with a bachelor's degree or post-graduate education (such as Ph.D., MD, JD) are more than three times a wealthy as black households with the same degree attainment."" https://socialequity.duke.edu/sites/socialequity.duke.edu/files/site-images/FINAL%20COMPLETE%20REPORT_.pdf There is data to show that on average, a highly educated household of color does not even have equitable wealth to a white household in which no individual has graduated from high school. If you have been inundated with the belief that education evens the playing ground between races, one needs to reconsider the context in which this idea has been promoted and whether or not the ""American Dream"" of depicting the hardworking minority that “succeeds through education” is actually a method of enabling structural disparities to continue. Education does not grant us any sort of immunity to discrimination in opportunities through life and it is necessary to stop lying to ourselves. B. Now let's move on to the idea of attractiveness. Word for word, the original poster claims that being attractive is a greater source privilege, “Look at the data, attractive people are constantly privileged in the workplace, in personal attractions, in finding a significant other (obviously).” The question to consider, which has already been started by a commenter below, is what do we deem attractive in society? The first method of examining the topic is to look at who is held responsible for determining the standards of beauty across the world. As research has shown, Western Beauty is associated with classism through cultural capital. Leah Kozee Youngblood states, “scholars from many different fields agree that the Western beauty standard revolves around racism, ageism, and classism (Gooden 2011; Lee 2009; Lewis, Medvedev, and Seponski 2011; Peat et al. 2008; Sengupta 2006; Shaw 2005; Slevin 2010; Taylor 2012). Beauty is not a mundane thing; it is an ideal intertwined with privilege. Arguably, the main attribute of the beauty standard is privilege. The changes in the ideal have always corresponded to the upper- class, privileged groups in American culture. By acknowledging that the changes in the Western beauty standard align with the changes in the privileged population, I argue that beauty is a form of hegemony. The beauty standard serves as a tool to keep less privileged women at the bottom of the social hierarchy. By giving them the label or title of “not beautiful”, the Western beauty ideal is a tool of oppression.” Given that documentaries and many research papers align with the idea that Western beauty is portrayed as the ideal in most circumstances (https://theillusionists.org, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234119371_The_impact_of_Western_beauty_ideals_on_the_lives_of_women_and_men_A_sociocultural_perspective, https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/psy_facpub/2028/, https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v42n3/pdf/yi.pdf ) , the privileges that exist for “beauty” benefit those that fit the mold of being white most. Being beautiful is a privilege but only for those that comply or exemplify the standards that are set out by those in power of the social structure and that implies whiteness “as the most acceptable”. Therefore, the argument proposed by #993 falls apart in stating that there are more privileges in beauty than in whiteness because the privilege of defining beauty belongs predominantly to those that are white. That is not to say being beautiful isn’t a privilege, because it is, just like education is a privilege. Rather it is to counteract the idea that 993 brings forth in diminishing white privilege to be “minor” and less than that of the privilege in beauty or education. C. Because I have grown up in a privileged area in terms of wealth, I strongly believe that wealth is an unfair privilege that enables many individuals to have a better base than others to “succeed”, with the stereotypical definitions of success. That being stated, I highly suggest those of you who may believe that wealth is the ultimate privilege to read this article and look at the data presented by New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html To highlight some of the most interesting points within the article: Black boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children. White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households. “One of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea,” said Ibram Kendi, a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. “But for whatever reason, we’re unwilling to stare racism in the face.” “Simply because you’re in an area that is more affluent, it’s still hard for black boys to present themselves as independent from the stereotype of black criminality,” said Khiara Bridges, a professor of law and anthropology at Boston University who has written a coming paper on discrimination against affluent black people. (NY Times, 2018) I fully recognize that wealth is a privilege but the data presented in this research tears apart the idea that being placed into wealth at birth is a greater privilege than being born into a white body. Another factor to consider is which individuals are actually born into wealth within the U.S. According to data from 2016, the average wealth of white families was around $919,000 while the average wealth of black families remained at $140,000 and Hispanic families at $192,000. (http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/) To put it in other words, a white family’s wealth was seven times greater than the wealth of black families on average. In other words, given that a white child has a much higher chance of being born into a family that is well-off, whiteness is very often aligned with the privilege of wealth. As #993 states, privilege is never going way. However, the privileges you brought up are heavily aligned with white privilege. To quote you directly, “being white is one minor facet out of the dozens to hundreds that determine how privileged someone is or isn't. It's just one of the easiest to see…” All the evidence above has spoken for itself and I would like to contradict you in all politeness, “Being white is a major facet out of the dozens to hundreds that determine how privileged someone is or isn't. And it happens to be just one of the easiest to see…” What you choose to do with the truth that lies in front of you is your call but I implore you never to sit back and buy into the lies that the world will feed you. Anonymously, Poster from #845","1415. To be absolutely honest, seeing 200+ likes on post #993 broke my heart because it was evidence that proved the ignorance of many individuals in a place where I truly believed people were able to think critically. If we are to examine this individual's unsupported claims, it is crucial to look at evidence rather than just accept what he or she said as truth. I want to preface this by stating that I mean not to offend anyone who agrees with the post below but rather, I proceed because I believe that the discourse is necessary. I am also apologizing in advance as I may know the original poster on a personal level so recognize that my aim here is not to criticize you as an individual but to dismantle some beliefs that were stated in ignorance. Perhaps you don’t care and given that is the case, I suggest you to stop reading. If you want to live life with authenticity and truth, regardless of how unpleasant the reality may be, then I invite you to read on. Let me start by supporting the statement that white-bashing is never appropriate. Race-bashing is never appropriate under any circumstances. That being stated, please take into account what we consider ""white-bashing"" and racial jokes surrounding white privilege has primarily arisen in the last few decades, whereas discrimination against non-white races has been tolerated for centuries. Neither are acceptable but perhaps we must then consider why we are so eager to come into savior-mode against white-bashing and racism against white people whereas in normal day-to-day contexts, it is also necessary to contemplate whether or not we are equally enthusiastic in standing up for those that face micro or macro-discrimination as racial minorities. The concept of ""white privilege"" was coined in 1965 during the Civil Rights Movement by a man named Theodore Allen. One Harvard-grad researcher illustrated her own opinions on the subject as a white person, stating that prior, ""as a white person, I realized I had been taught about racism as something which puts others at a disadvantage, but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects, white privilege which puts me at an advantage"". I strongly believe that the quote reflects the case for a lot of us in positions comparable to hers. That is how we want to see racial relations-that if I'm not a racist, not discriminating actively, treating all races as equals, then I should not ever have to dwell on the idea of white privilege because there's nothing I am actively infringing upon. The researcher above, McIntosh, then expresses, ""I think whites are carefully taught not to recognize white privilege, as males are taught not to recognize male privilege. So I have begun in an untutored way to ask what it is like to have white privilege. I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets that I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was “meant” to remain oblivious.

2288403401436085,"1405. I've been living with an undiagnosed mental illness for a few years now. For the most part I am able to function day-to-day, hiding my pain behind a smile. But since coming to Berkeley, dealing with my illness has gotten worse. I used to deal with more stereotypical depression, going through these prolonged periods of inescapable sadness that made me want to hide in bed until the feelings passed. Recently, this depression has become less a numbness and more an acute and almost physical pain that brings me to the edge of tears or screaming. I feel an overwhelming self-hatred in my chest, and all I want to do is rip out my heart and make the pain stop.
This is what scares me. I feel like I am going insane. It seems I underestimated my mental illness. The depression is growing more intense, and it only seems to be getting worse. Most days, I can hardly imagine myself alive in ten years. When the depression is at its worst, I only feel the strength to endure a few more of these depressive episodes before I do something to hurt myself. It's exhausting to go through these mood swings, and it is almost impossible to function when it is a struggle just to stay alive to see tomorrow.
I know I have a wonderful life and much to be grateful for, but I still can't escape this darkness in my mind. The sad thing is that Berkeley might be a partial cause of my worsening state. College is a place where you are never truly alone. No matter where I go, even my own room, someone's eyes are always on me. Usually, these are the cold eyes of a stranger. There is no place where I can just let out all my pain and hide from the world, and this creates the feeling of being trapped. At least when I am home for break, I have something of a space for myself. But when I go back to school again, I know it will all get worse.
I feel like I am running out of options. Therapy is expensive and I am terrified to try medication. I fear if I ever become dependant on meds, the moment I stop using them will be the end. I could never get over the guilt of taking a gap year or dropping out altogether. It seems my only solution is to keep pushing against the world until something breaks in me. All I can do is hope I'm still alive a year from now. So here's to all the other Golden Bears going through a similar struggle. We may have a shitty semester ahead of us, but let's get through it together.","1405. I've been living with an undiagnosed mental illness for a few years now.

2288398931436532,"1403. CW: Rape
My ex told her friends that I was great in bed, some details included. Something that I actually didn't feel very comfortable with but I also didn't took many attention to it. I only discovered that because some of her friends approach me to know more about me since for them I was 'available'. One of her friends made me a proposal. She told me she was inexperienced and since I was so great she wanted to pay me to go to bed with her to teach her some things. I obviously felt insulted and said no.
Some days later I was at a party and the same girl kept insisting really hard. It made me feel very uncomfortable not only because of the situation itself but because I was with someone else. Later that night she apologized and offered me a drink. I felt so relieved. Turned out she had put something in that drink. I don't remember things very well. I just have flashes in my head until this very day. It was very weird like I couldn't control my body. She took me to her house against my will and started to undress me. I said I didn't want it to. I felt so disgusted. I kept insisting I wanted to leave but she kept saying I would going to love it. She was always in control of the situation. I tried several times to go away but I was so drugged that I barely could stand up. She took my clothes of and started kissing me. I remember crying hopeless without managing to get her of me. She tied me to the bed and started to give me a bj. Then she went on top of me and she forced me to have sex with her. I felt so humiliated. Didn't know what to think what to do. I passed out and don't remember much about the rest. I woke up with her still by my side. I was very afraid. Didn't know how to deal with the situation. She said it was the best sex of her life. That my ex was right and that she was very luck. That it was all worth it. I was in shock and couldn't say a word. She told me that she didn't care what I would tell anyone cause no one would believe me. No one would care and in fact people would just make fun of me. For a while I seek helped but found no information about it. I finally gain the courage to tell my friends about it. It was a mistake. she was right. No one believed me.
Some people might not believe this because of the fact that obviously a guy needs to be excited in order to commit the act. It's actually kinda hard to explain. It's just the same as the girls that have orgasms when raped. Obviously they are not enjoying it. It's a biological process over the body that you cannot control whatsoever.","1403. CW: Rape

I felt so disgusted. I kept insisting I wanted to leave but she kept saying I would going to love it. She was always in control of the situation. I tried several times to go away but I was so drugged that I barely could stand up. She took my clothes of and started kissing me. I remember crying hopeless without managing to get her of me. She tied me to the bed and started to give me a bj. Then she went on top of me and she forced me to have sex with her. I felt so humiliated. Didn't know what to think what to do. I passed out and don't remember much about the rest. I woke up with her still by my side. I was very afraid. Didn't know how to deal with the situation. She said it was the best sex of her life. That my ex was right and that she was very luck. That it was all worth it. I was in shock and couldn't say a word. She told me that she didn't care what I would tell anyone cause no one would believe me. No one would care and in fact people would just make fun of me. For a while I seek helped but found no information about it. I finally gain the courage to tell my friends about it. It was a mistake. she was right. No one believed me.
Some people might not believe this because of the fact that obviously a guy needs to be excited in order to commit the act. It's actually kinda hard to explain. It's just the same as the girls that have orgasms when raped. Obviously they are not enjoying it. It's a biological process over the body that you cannot control whatsoever.",,1548016232,,,40,15,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2288398931436532&id=2156420374634389,

Before I start I'd like to ask anyone who knows enough to identify me to not tag me. It really wouldn't help anything.
My brother is bipolar and it's been tearing my family apart for almost four years now. He spent two hours yesterday venting on me after I called him self centered for forgetting about my back condition again. He just kept screaming at me about his friends not wanting to see him when he's been gone for two years, our dad not letting him drive with the excuse of him not having insurance, his lack of independence when he's 24 years old, and many more things besides. My heart breaks for him, but each one was punctuated with a ""FUCK YOU"" and he kept slipping in references to being self centered to hammer it in. And I just fucking can't. I just can't anymore.
He had a nightmare last night about our dad dying so he woke me up at 5:30am because he didn't want to be alone so I kept him company but he just KEEPS making messes in the kitchen and wasting food and slamming doors and being rough with my dad's VERY expensive sound equipment and he slammed the fridge and something broke so I'm cleaning up the glass and he's just sitting there chain smoking cigarettes and then I asked him something about letting someone know he wouldn't need a ride and he just screamed ""fuck you I know what I'm doing"" and threw my suicidal best friend that I don't talk to anymore in my face saying to go save him if I'm so holy and I just broke.
I laid in bed for half an hour bawling with my cat because my sister is at school and my parents are away and I just can't anymore and I feel so shitty that I can't do more for him because I know however bad it is for me it's a thousand times worse for him but I'm not a saint you know?
... My God I need therapy to get through this. I honestly don't know why I haven't started seeing someone yet. I'm gonna go with on that.
Thanks for being a good place to vent. I understand if you don't decide to post it, just being able to vent anonymously helps.","1396.

I am pro-choice. That means I believe a sentient and sane human being should have the right to choose life or not. That means the choice to abortions, but also to suicide.
I feel like this view would get a lot of hate simply because we live in such a pro-life world, where “death” is seen as the worst thing ever. Umm, no. I’ve lived through horrors that are worse than living at all (but if I start listing them then I won’t be anonymous so you’ll just have to take my word for it that it’s been and will continue to be a painful life). I was suicidal once, but I’ve gotten through it so I love life right now and I’m so thankful that my experiences have made me stronger and all that cheesy stuff blah blah blah. That hasn’t made me change my mind. I have seen similar or worse things happen to others and they have not become stronger because of it; on the contrary, they’re quite pitiable. So I would not wish these experiences even on my worst enemies because they’re only half of what contributes to our identities.
The point is, there are some unspeakable horrors in life that are much worse than the emptiness of death, and not everyone can spiritually survive it. Sometimes it turns us into despicable and/or pained people. They say that suicide is a permanent solution, but they forget that not everything is a temporary problem. I believe in death with dignity — assisted suicide and euthanasia — if the person’s already-poor quality of life will not improve, or even if it would suck the livelihood out of a person to try to get through their “temporary” horrors. We put our beloved animals to sleep, so why are we so against respecting the wishes of fellow human beings?
I plan on dying by my own choice. Hopefully it will be legal by then — after all, I do intend on enjoying what I have now, so hopefully I won’t need to for some decades at least. But I know that a natural death will be excruciating for me, so I’m being proactive in avoiding that. And there’s only one way. I will rest in my own time, not because of nature and some societal expectation.
In the meanwhile, I wish society would stop judging suicide (NOT SUICIDAL IDEATION RESULTING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS) as weak or absurd. People are only as strong as they can be, and sometimes choosing death is the hard but necessary choice.","1394. “Life implies death — or shall I say, death implies life.” ~Alan Watts.

We'll hide our meetups and hookups enough that it wouldn't trigger anyone to suspect that I'm being physically intimate with anyone, but still allow people know that we're platonic friends.

Cause I think it forces the weirdos to look at themselves, and also who doesn’t benefit from avoiding those fuckers? On the first date, I may say “I was astounded by how creepy he was” but am I telling the truth? Yes and no. Yes, because, well, I did feel that he exuded a off-putting vibe and I would think most people would agree. No, because he actually didn't do anything that constitutes harassment and I never felt violated by him per se.
Sometimes it helps me, myself too, making sure that I don’t subconsciously let my guard down. Like I may hear them saying they go to therapy to get better with social cues and I say that as long as you're putting in your due diligence you should be ok. Well, I am not lying, but it is also not all I have in mind. Obviously I am not gonna feel totally comfortable around you because you definitely have trouble taking hints.
This happens in bed too. I usually take a short break, to tell “even though you're not a bad person, I didn't like it and I should be going” and then tell my friends that they should try to stay far away from him. Am I lying? Yes and no. Yes, because he didn't actually break any boundaries and I would have reported him to the police if he did. And no, because, many people are wonderful in bed, but you the though of seeing him partially or fully naked makes me recoil intensely.
I may even pretend I am fine with being around you if you want to stay after such bad sex ‘because we can just talk and it's late’, but to be honest, most of the time I'd rather dash out of there and run however many miles back to my house to sleep alone instead of spending another minute around you.
Unfortunately, sometimes they cannot understand the line between someone expressing interest and someone just tolerating their presence after a bad experience. I have warned everyone around me a lot over the years that sometimes I am not even aware of it. This is actually bothering me a lot, but well, I have also learned how to take advantage. Nowadays, if I realize that if I actually think a person was worth spending time with, I tell them the exact same horror stories as I do to my platonic friends. It works very well; the expansion of the network of people who are aware of these pathetic incels starts to accelerate in a few days, and tell me who wouldn't want to know these useful tips?","1382.

Many unions have a system which favors those who have seniority, not those who are the most qualified. They may preach inclusiveness and diversity and they may even back bills that demand diversity in work places, but when it comes down to it, those in power are those who have been loyal to the system for the longest. In other words, since racial discrimination was at its worst only a few decades ago (it’s still there but it’s clearly improving in many industries), minorities with the most professional qualifications are often mostly in the younger generations. However because of unions, oppressed minorities face compounded institutionalized racism as they are often not favored by the unions pretending to protect them due to their lack of seniority. This means when budget cuts roll around, old white folks (who probably can’t even operate their iPhone let alone the computer they need for their job) keep their position but younger more vulnerable and more diverse workers get the axe.
Remember, unions are the ones that pushed for the whole protection from that “age-ism” bullshit just to keep unproductive dinosaurs from losing their jobs.","1369.

I usually don’t talk about this with people because it may come across as me being privileged, and most of you will just not understand this at all, but hear me out.
When people ask me where I’m from, the first thing that comes to mind is “It’s complicated”. I grew up half of my life in the states and half in a foreign country. I was able to attend an International School, meaning I was able to speak English at school and partake in what emulated an American education system. Most of the students at these schools are pretty well off, some would say in the top 1% in terms of wealth in their respective countries. My parents are middle class, but definitely not wealthy. Going to these types of schools, you see kids with their own personal chauffeurs getting driven to school in a company car, going on weekend trips to exotic countries on a whim, and buying designer clothing just because they can. I was not one of those people, and I didn’t mind, but it definitely alienated you in a certain way.
Coming back to the states for college, I know once people know I’m an “international student”, they automatically see me in a different light. They assume I’m rich, and that’s my dad payed my way into this school, and that I probably fly back to my home country 8 times a year and buy shit from Gucci every weekend. But here’s the truth:
I only get to go home once a year, maybe twice if I’m lucky. I only get to hug my parents and my dog 1-2 times a year. My best friends are all over the world doing their own things, so I barely get to see them once a year. And yeah, I’m lucky that I have a family who loves me and is willing to sacrifice their hard earned money to send me to college and maybe fly me home every 6-12 months. And I am so grateful for that. But every time I go back home, things have changed so much while I was gone. It feels vaguely familiar, but also really foreign. It doesn’t feel like home even when I say it. Being a half a world away from family, and feeling like I don’t belong here or there, is quite lonely.
So this one is for all of you in the in between; when home is not a certain place, but with the people you love and wherever in the world they are.","1359.

2282483142028111,"1333. My ex has really controlling parents, to the point where I wonder if he’s being emotionally abused. He’s a senior now and his parents still call him every day late at night to demand things from him, tell him he’s stupid when he doesn’t understand something, and control what classes to take and what clubs to join. He couldn’t go out of state for internships, grad school, or travel since his parents always demanded that he stayed close to home. He doesn’t even plan to move out after graduating and getting a job since his parents are depending on his financial support.
I know his parents love and care about him, but it really pained me to see him treated like that. I guess this kind of behavior is normal for Asian parents, but at least in my my mind, no child deserves to be insulted and controlled to this extent. Because of the way he was brought up, he can’t express his emotions properly or directly communicate with others when he has problems with them. There were times during our relationship where he’d kick and punch things out of frustration since he didn’t know how else to express how he was feeling. Even when he had problems with other friends, his first reaction was always to repress his emotions rather than talk to them directly.
It’s been a while since we’ve last spoken and I’ve had more time to reflect on him and the problems in our relationship. There were times where I’d get frustrated with him, since he’d ask me for advice but was resistant to take it. In his mind, he was completely helpless, and cannot and should not try to get out of his situation. He wasn’t ready to change. I know now that this is commonly a result of parental abuse, and I feel sorry for being impatient with him. I feel like I've learned how to better take care of someone in a situation like this, but at the end of the day, he wasn’t in the right state of mind to be in a relationship, and we’re not in each other’s lives anymore.
I still love and care about him a lot. I wish I could still be there for him to help him through things, but I don’t think I can be the person to heal him. Maybe one day we can talk and be friends again, but for now we both need space. I sincerely hope that he finds someone else who can be there for him and understand him, and I’m always grateful for all the care he showed me. I just wish things could have been different.","1333.

When I was younger, I used to love singing around the house. I might have even pursued choir because I loved it so much. But back then, my brother would always tell me to stop singing. Which, actually, fair. He was a teen at the time; I’m sure listening to his younger sibling must have been grating. But he was never kind about it, always demanding that I should shut up, and as a result, I became really self-conscious about singing. I ended up picking up an instrument instead (although, he became annoyed when I had to practice said instrument in the house too).
But, as of this winter break, the tables have turned. He recently got a pair of wireless headphones. As a result, he parades around the house, blissfully unaware that he’s practically yelling as he sings. And, well, now it’s grating on *my* nerves.
Part of me wants to continue to let him sing. It’s what I wish he had done for me as younger child. But also, part of me wants to confront him about it for the sake of my sanity (he doesn’t even sing goooood). I am literally losing sleep over this because he’s shrieking in the morning before I’ve even gotten up (and, I deserve this sleep, because I worked my butt off this semester, god damn it). It’s such a trivial thing to be conflicted about, but I guess I’m just not used to having to confront my older brother.","1326. My older sibling won’t shut up.

Obviously I am not gonna ask more about what I feel you might not be comfortable with.
This happens in bed too. I usually take a short break, to tell “how wonderful they are” and then “enjoy” the rest. Am I lying? Yes and no. Yes, because otherwise I would have kicked you out. And no, because, many people are wonderful in bed, you are not the most amazing one.
I may even pretend I am interested if you want to stay more after sex ‘because it was such a great time’, but to be honest, most of the times I just want you to leave as soon as possible if we didn’t plan in advance.

2278996079043484,"1263. I’m in my 20s right now and having someone desire me sexually has been such a surreal experience. For the first time in my life, I have to think about how to pleasure someone else. When I masturbate now, I sometimes imagine what I could do to pleasure someone else and look good while pleasuring myself, instead of just staring at some random girl while jacking for 2 minutes a pop. It’s so crazy and I don't even know how to describe it. And I also find myself thinking a lot more about how I might have to set up my bed (or somewhere else we could screw) for two people. And it’s also crazy how vulnerable both of us having sex could be. Both of us are exposing very vulnerable parts to each other, both physically and mentally/emotionally and you’re both so vulnerable because you lay your things out for the other person and trust them, almost blindly, knowing that it could be broken at anytime, and I think that it’s one of the most intricate and nuanced things that people can do. Having so much trust and attraction in/to a person that you’d be willing to show it all despite all the risks of getting violated can seem so illogical, but the pleasure we both will hopefully get makes it feel like it’s worth it. And thinking about the fact that she recognizes these risks and is not a tad less willing to do me makes me trust her even more.
I also used to be in so many toxic interactions, where girls would take advantage of my social naivete and simultaneous sexual desire/pessimism to get things they wanted. I was convinced to settle for those situations because I felt like the only way people could want me was if I became a neutered, disembodied personality they could form a deeply emotional but sexless attachment to. So if I ever meet this girl in person and she invites me to reach under her clothes or calls me to help her cum or just flops on my chest while cuddling after a long day, it always makes me cry on the inside a little because I’ve realized that I maybe do deserve better in the future and I was just resigning myself to my circumstances and lack of social skills, and I’m so thankful that she let me know that I am bringing myself out of a dark place and let me see what it means to actually partake in exploring my sexuality just like any other human being can.
If this gets posted, you will say “odd flex, but ok”. But this is just a confession that I think others should hear.","1263.

At first, he seemed nice and we did not have a problem until one day, as we were sitting in a restaurant, I noticed his hand reaching towards the area where his genitals would be. I was embarrassed to stare or change my view angle to make sure where it was. This movement repeated a few times and I thought, it must be itching. He repeated this behavior a few more times and again, I was too embarrassed to make sure or bring it up. Maybe, I also wished to ignore it because I liked him. Last time we went to the movies, he kept doing that again. This time, the number of ""itches"" was much more, maybe more than 15, and the duration of each itch was longer. I could not ignore it. I turned around and saw him nervously starting to itch his ankle and neck, as if he wanted to say it was just an itch. After the movie was over, I saw the disturbed face of the man sitting on his other side. Was he really pleasuring himself? In front of me? In public? Even if he was really itching, it was low etiquette so I dumped him. But it still keeps bugging me, what was he doing?","1261. A friend introduced a guy to me.

They have other options like Carol Christ’s second home on campus, but have opted to destroy Berkeley’s largest, most historic safe space for the homeless community. Destruction began today and was chosen over break because of the lack of student activists on campus during this time. If you are in Berkeley please stand up for this. This is hijacking land in the 21st century. Where else will these people go? Where will they be safe? They already have very little and the university is robbing them of a very large part of what they have left during some of their most trying times.
If you truly are a Cal student, do anything you can, small or large to get involved. If you’re in Berkeley, talk with park members you see and ask what you can do to help. Ask when protests will take place. If you aren’t in Berkeley, spread the word about what’s happening! The park is 50 years old and a historic landmark as well. They are destroying it over break to minimize publicity. They know it is wrong, and they are trying to silence everyone who cares in the process. I have spoken with city council, the senate, and christ herself and they all know what they are doing is wrong and not the best option, however, it is the most convenient and least costly. Is THAT what Berkeley is about? How can they demand academic perfection from us when they can’t even put in a bit more work for a plan that accommodates students, staff, and community? I love Berkeley, but fuck the university for literally destroying the homes of community members as we speak. Spread the word. Don’t be silent. Don’t be complacent.

I’m a freshmen and I came from a really small town in SoCal and had know not a single soul on this campus. I was really intimated, especially after GBO, to not have any friend groups or people I was slightly interested in, even after most of the people I lived around already has established there own little cliche.
So due to it all, I decided to rush a sorority. All my friends from back home were the typical sorority bitches, so it was no surprise that I also hopped on that trend. For my defense, I literally had NO friends and this really was the start to my social life here at cal and I have that to thank. But in all honestly, I MADE A HUGE FUCKING MISTAKE. And the worst part is, there’s no going back.
During rush week, I pretty much half-assed every single event and kind of took it as a joke. Every house I went to, every girl I talked to, it was all the same fake conversation all over again. An endless cycle of the same skinny white girl telling me how great the sisterhood was and all these amazing charities that they had hosted blah blah blah. It was so falsely portrayed, but it’s what I had to do to be a part of a community, and I was so fucking insecure and lonely, so I had to do it despite my pride.
Somehow I made it to a house that had a reputation of being the best, or the “top house”. Basically what this meant was that it was all the prettiest/richest girls, with a huge ass house and parties with all the top frats and such. But in my one semester of being a part of this shit, I have seen so much pain and it’s terrible.
I never thought this would happen to me, but I was sexual assaulted and the worst part is I didn’t even realize it was assault when it happened. It was only October, yet I had already experienced pretty vulgar shit as a Freshmen. The fact that the phrase “you’re barely a freshmen” was said to me by an older girl in my sorority just highlighted the action of assault being something that is bound to happen eventually to every girl in a sorority. WHAT THE FUCK.
And the worst part was, I tried so hard to inform people about it, and they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. NOPE. NOTHING. I remember in the beginning right after rush week we had a ‘sex ed’ type of talk and they really emphasized their awareness to issues like rape or assault, and that if we ever needed to talk about anything, that they were there for us. WRONG.
So much bad things happen in these sororities that no one has even heard of yet because of confidentiality between the sisters so that the chapter won’t get shut down!!!! They are so worried about their image that they rather keep all their problems on the down-low to uphold their fake ass reputation!!!!! Upperclassmen don’t do shit, and most of the girls in my pledge class don’t wanna speak up either because this sorority is the reason for their clout that they’ve earned here at Cal. I’m fucking sick.
Being a woman, I’m disenfranchised by Greek life. And being a victim of sexual assault, I’m forgotten. I’ve met 2 girls who have made me feel uncomfortable by using racist language and derogatory terms towards other women in my pledge class, despite being “sisters”. I’ve been stereotyped and made inferior by my peers who I thought were my friends, and I’ve been taken advantage of. But because this is the only standing I have made for myself, I am stuck.
I see the boy who took advantage of me almost every weekend, and I hate the way he looks at me. He got away with something and only because no one had my back on it, I will never be able to speak up about it.
So here’s this confession to let you know that Greek life is full of girls like me who can’t say anything about the troubles that affect us by choosing to go down this path. And for those who are probably gonna say “just leave if it’s a toxic environment”... I’m trying to figure out how to break the system from the inside, believe me. I can no longer stay silent about this. Also I have absolutely no friends and if I leave, I’ll drive myself insane.

Confessions from UC Berkeley
December 20, 2018 at 6:00 PM ·
1091. There’s this one couple I see every few weeks or so in Beverly Cleary. They do everything together and it seemed to me like they were just one of those annoying couples who are infatuated with each other.

It was midterm season, it was 3 AM, and I figured you just needed to let off some steam and your roommates were sleeping. but then it started to happen all of the time, and I mean ALL of the time. you have become a floor meme. i know it’s you because you always have the same colored towel, and I swear to God if this happens one more time when we come back from break, I’m gonna steal your fucking towels, hide, and wait for you to leave so that I can expose your asses for ruining my fifteen minutes a day of pure, uninterrupted, foot-fungus fearing relaxation.

2275774879365604,"1216. I regret graduating so early. I killed myself studying to finish three semesters ahead of time, and I feel like I completely missed out on the college experience. I didn't get to walk in spring with a class of people I'd been with for four years. Instead, I stumbled through fall graduation trying to look like I wasn't by myself while the other people who were there laughed about inside jokes with their friends. I barely made any friends in the time I was here, and no one's bothered to contact me now that they aren't running into me every day. I joined a total of three clubs at Cal, none of which I made real connections through or even stayed in past one semester. I really wanted to see the world, and I'm super jealous of the people I know who did get to study abroad because I feel like the experience really changed them and I don't know when I'll ever get the chance to dramatically expand my worldview like that now that I don't have the university support behind me. I didn't have time for dating, and now I feel woefully unequipped for maintaining a relationship in the adult world (not into hookups, I'm a hopeless romantic type of gal). I thought at the very least I'd have the cool job offers I lined up earlier, but even some of those didn't pan out. Now I'm doing something I don't care about at my second choice company, slaving away 8 hours a day with coworkers I have nothing in common with, wishing I could stress over finals or be in a study group. Don't graduate early, even if you think it sucks here. It sucks so much worse after. I wish I had savored my time here more, and I regret it every day.","1216. I regret graduating so early.

2274905952785830,"1203. I really need to get this off my chest because my roommate made this the most intolerable semester I’ve had so far at Berkeley and is finally leaving:
1. I accommodated her like an idiot by allowing her to kick me out of the room “because she can’t sleep with my desk light on” when she needed to sleep (anywhere unpredictable from 8pm-12am) for 13 of the 15 weeks of the semester PLUS she naps a lot in the afternoons without warning, while I normally work until 1-2am and need my specific room setup for personal reasons
2. It was BS because she did fall asleep fine when the light was on many times and didn’t realize it
3. This is even though we signed a roommate agreement together in the beginning, but she used the excuse that “she was too tired so that’s why she signed the agreement” to try to get out of the contract
4. Sexiled me on random occasions on the days of important deadlines for me and never asked for permission, just did it and left condom/post-sex remnants everywhere in the room
5. Would hate on my friends and not let my boyfriend stay over even though she’d invite new boys over
6. Expected me to stay in my boyfriend’s place even though I needed to stay in the room and would become passive aggressive otherwise
7. Went through my drawers and took my things without asking, and wouldn’t return them unless I noticed and asked for them back
8. Would often complain about people she hated in her Haas classes and then talk about how my classes shouldn’t take so long because “python isn’t that bad” when I told her I had to spend the day working on my 2 CS projects that weren’t even in python
9. Stopped doing her monthly bathroom cleaning duty after the first month, making the rest of us pick up after her daily messes
10. Made me sleep outside and couch-surf, or just not sleep at all because it just wasn’t worth a few hours of awful sleep and then being intentionally woken up early in the morning by her almost everyday because she wanted to let me know she “thought I looked funny sleeping”
11. Threw tantrums, repeatedly called me “inconsiderate,” ignored me, and talked smack to everyone she knew like a child every time I asked her to work out a more reasonable situation
I have mental health needs I had set up my side of the room for that she never accommodated, and she tries to portray herself outside of our room as this super nice, ‘considerate’ person to others while making my own life a nightmare. She did this with her previous roommate too, who turned out to be just nice and fine. I should have seen it as a red flag from the beginning. I hope she never has another roommate because she is the most entitled and selfish brat I’ve ever met and I’d never wish that experience on my worst enemy.
Also, I’m sure you know who you are and if you’re reading this, I really don’t think you shouldn’t be insulting people of your own race - stop trying to be someone you’re not and stop hating on the rest of us who are actually proud of our culture. You don’t belong in Subtle Asian Traits hating on Asians like that. Listening to French music, trying to learn European languages and talking about how you’ll only date white people “because you just don’t like Asian people or culture” won’t make you white. You need to either embrace your physical identity or at least stop insulting your own race - it’s embarrassing and offensive. I’d tell you myself but you would just make a nonsensical excuse as you normally do. Good riddance.","1203.

I've met non-vegans with more love for animals and conviction for animal rights than you. When you say that, you make it all about yourself. You act as if you're making voluntary choices.
You act as if the choice is about the food on your plate, not about the choice of work for immigrants exploited in slaughterhouses (who are unable to complain and must remain for a long time), the choice of indebted countries exporting grain to US factory farms, or the choice of a mother cow forcibly impregnated in order to lactate.
You're ignoring the fact that it's not a choice for people in areas in the US called ""food deserts,"" where cancer-associated fast-food chains have taken over, where people wish they could buy vegan food at the grocery store miles away and have the time to prep it. By saying, ""just choose,"" you are marginalizing their struggle to eat within their conscience. A homeless person once explained to me that they went vegan because they were able to empathize with the animals.
And when you make fun of people for not being vegan, it's frustrating. I know you go through far more and real ridicule and shame for going vegan, so if you finally form a majority at a table you may feel empowered. But if you want to espouse the compassion you went vegan for, behave yourself. My disability has ingrained in me what it feels like to be isolated. As people socially isolated working for animals isolated in cages, we have to be better.
Many of you convert more people to veganism than I do. But the number of vegans doesn't matter to me; what matters is our love for animals. I wouldn't want to live in a world where despite everyone going vegan, animals are still treated as lower beings, subject to human will. Remember the 13th, which didn't abolish slavery, but changed its form (prison labor). Freeing slaves wasn't enough, and veganism won't be, either.
Dear vegans who say, ""veganism is a personal choice,"" I've definitely done this in the past. I'm not saying this because I want to shame you. I'm saying this because we can all do better. Vegan, or not vegan, it doesn't matter. What matters is our love, support, and sacrifice for each other, in spite of our differences in race, gender, disability, or species.

I’m having some family problems and was hoping to get some help from yall. My younger sibling unexpectedly passed away a couple months ago and it completely devastated my whole family. My parents especially. My parents are devorced and both are financially struggling as well. To the point where a couple of problems could lead to a crisis.

I’m having some family problems and was hoping to get some help from yall. My younger sibling unexpectedly passed away a couple months ago and it completely devastated my whole family. My parents especially. My parents are devorced and both are financially struggling as well. To the point where a couple of problems could lead to a crisis. My mom was very distraught but has filled her life with work and seems to be doing better than my father. My father lives with his mom and all he does is drink, smoke and sleep. It seems hes lost complete motivation to live now. I dont know how to help him or motivate him to do something with his life and become a better person.

2273565109586581,"1175. I recommend to anyone that is looking for a real relationship to stay away from Bumble or Tinder. The best way to fall in love is slowly and without intention. I genuinely feel that if I had met him in a different/more organic way, without a lingering pressure/expectation to make it work that we could have been amazing. There was a clear and constant attraction from our first date, but it seemed too good to be true. At least for me (I can't speak for him), the tension that followed our relationship was built from waiting to find a flaw in him, wanting to open myself to him, and avoiding vulnerability for the fear of rejection. He acknowledged that tension, but instead of asking or wanting to figure out why it was there, he left. He ended things between us because he said felt unhappy and he needed a breakup. He dared to call me the highlight of his time at Cal, he dared to say that he felt like himself around me, all while breaking my heart. He put together a ""it's not you, it's me"" speech on how he wanted a clean slate for next semester. He didn't like where he was, he didn't like who he was. He tossed me in a pile labeled ""Things That Are Going Wrong- Fall 2018"" and just wanted to leave. He said he wasn't happy. He wanted to end things just as winter break started so he would have ample time to move on from us. He couldn't even tell me this in person.
I wanted to fight for him. I gave him options. I suggested we start over. I even wanted to stay friends and just give him time. There wasn't anything I could do by then. He made up his mind. I had to accept it and I thanked him for what we had. I even reassured him that if he ever needed anything, that he has someone, all feelings aside. I told him he was amazing. The last thing he told me was that he felt the exact same way. The last thing he did to me was block me on every social media platform. It was a very painful but I guess rather amicable parting.
What hurts me deeply is knowing that he will forever hold a perception of me that is completely inaccurate. Although I did reveal parts of me, they were microscopic compared to the entirety of me. He didn’t stay long enough for me to open up or to trust him in such an intimate way. What hurts me even more deeply is that I wanted to know more about him and was willing to listen, but we never sat down and took the time to find out why we are who we are. I know I wasn't fully ready to be vulnerable to him and the few times he opened up to me I couldn't find the right words to comfort him. The worst heartbreak is the one that is based on misunderstandings and miscommunication.
At this point, my only option is to move on as well. I know we both had been hurt in the past and had carried our insecurities into this, dooming it from the beginning. We both have our own issues that we need to work on. I wish we could have worked on improving ourselves together, but I don't think that was possible for us. I just can't get over how much I liked him and how much I could have loved him. I can't get over how great we could have been had we just opened our walls to each other. My final ounce of hope is placed in the idea that if we are truly meant to be, one day when we are both ready and capable of love, our paths will cross again.","1175.

2272928119650280,"1173. I’m in my 20s right now and getting a girlfriend has been such a surreal experience. For the first time in my life, I have to think about someone else in my life. When I go out now, I get two of everything now: two milk teas, two orders of wherever we eat for take out, etc. it’s so crazy and makes me so happy. And I also find myself getting two pairs of utensils and basically getting everything for two people. And it’s also crazy how vulnerable both people in the relationship are. Both of you are giving up parts of you, both physically and mentally/emotionally and you’re both so vulnerable because you lay your heart out for the other person and trust them, almost blindly, knowing that it could be broken at anytime, and I think that it’s one of the most beautiful and crazy things that people can do. Having so much trust and attraction in/to a person that you’d be willing to give up a part of you despite all the risks of getting hurt is so illogical, but the emotional connection makes it feel like it’s worth it. And thinking about the fact that my girlfriend would be willing to do that just makes me more attracted to her.
I also used to be in so many toxic interactions, where girls would take advantage of my emotional vulnerability and sexual inexperience to get things they wanted. I was convinced to settle for those situations because I felt like the only way I could be loved was physically. So whenever my girlfriend asks me about what I like or calls me a cute name or starts rubbing my hair, it always makes me cry on the inside a little because I’ve realized that I deserved better and I was just holding myself back by settling for my circumstances, and I’m so thankful that she brought me out of a dark place and let me see what it means to be actually loved.
If this gets posted, I will say “odd flex, but ok”. But this is just a confession from my heart.","1173. I’m in my 20s right now and getting a girlfriend has been such a surreal experience.

2272923429650749,"1166. I'm asking for some general dating advice, and hopefully the responses may help someone else too:
When I came to Cal a few months ago, I was a slightly repressed, insecure kid from a conservative town in the Midwest. Luckily, I found an amazing friend group that helped me unlearn all the bullshit that I had internalized growing up. Basically, I got Queer Eye’d. Now I’m a lot more confident, and my personal style has finally evolved beyond hoodies and cargo shorts.
Ever since my ~transformation~ (eyeroll), I’ve noticed that I’m getting a lot more male attention. When I’m out in Moffitt or a coffee shop, I sometimes catch cute guys trying to subtly check me out. It usually amounts to only a few instances of tentative eye contact spread out over an hour before one of us leaves, but I feel like there’s potential for at least a spontaneous conversation or something. The thing is, because I’ve been closeted for most of my life, I have next to zero experience talking to dudes irl. I usually stick to Tinder/Grindr, but dating apps are starting to burn me out (judging by some of the confessions on here, a good number of you feel the same way).
Long story short, my question is: How do you shoot your shot with a total stranger? Is that even socially acceptable, or is it a sign of desperation? My main worry is that I’ll inadvertently make someone uncomfortable when they’re just trying to mind their own business. It’s just that I’m finally at home in my own skin, and I feel like I can’t complain about being lonely if I haven’t exhausted every possible avenue… Help?","1166.

The vet gave me some anti biotic drops to put in his food but when I’d do that Franki wouldn’t touch it. So, the vet suggested using a small dropper tube to insert the medicine directly into his anus. The first time was absolute hell, my cat fought me the whole time but once the tube was in and the medicine pushed out he seemed to calm quite a bit. Well the next day he was acting strange, he has always been an independent cat, rarely coming around, never wanting to be held, but as I sat on the couch he started walking back and forth meowing and rubbing my leg. He then went and jumped up on the table where we’d done the application the night before and meowed louder and louder until I decided I guess we will go ahead and do the medicine treatment. This time he didn’t fight me though, and when I inserted the tube he closed his eyes, stretched his neck, and let out a noise that can only be described as a moan of pure ecstasy. Maybe the medicine made him feel better, I supposed. That night he slept on my bed curled up right next to me, which he had never done before. For the next week he’d do the same thing every day, meow on the table until he got his ‘fix’... But then the medicine ran out. Even though I had no medicine he’d still cry and beg for it, I thought maybe if I insert it without medicine he will realize it doesn’t make him feel better anymore and forget about it. Well that was 2 weeks ago and he is only getting worse. He walks around me all day with his tail up presenting his rectum and trying to entice me. He is demanding insertions more and more often. Yesterday I caught him looking longingly at the turkey baster... When I sit he jumps in my lap purring and rubbing me affectionately. It was then in horror I realized my cat thinks I’m his gay lover, and that I’ve been sexually pleasing him for weeks now. Needless to say the sexual tension between us is palpable. How do I let my cat know that I’m not gay, but still like him as a friend?

Yet with all the gifts that I've been given I can't help but somehow believe that I'm suppose to do more and do better and my lack of ability to maintain anything that feels like meaningful success drives me deeper and deeper into sadness.

As great of a privilege as it has been to be born to a loving educated family with a good income it feels more and more like a curse. My parents have tried to ease up on the pressure because they can see how damaged I am, but by now it's a personal belief rather than their teachings. I am responsible for my family's legacy and I'm responsible to the country that gave me so much. If I am not ten times more wealthy and accomplished than people born with 1/10th I have then I don't think it's right for me to waste space on this earth that I clearly don't deserve.

I've been thinking of transferring to other schools, but my gpa is so low now that I'm anxious that I won't get in anywhere. Now I feel like I'm stuck in a hole that I dug myself and cant get out of.

It's devastating to see a higher institution that's supposed to support the dreams you have take them away just for the prestige of being called a ""hard"" school. Some classes at Cal are ridiculously difficult with no reason and it seems as if professors want their students to do horribly. Why else would there be curveballs on exams?

So Clarence Chen walked up to me at a hackathon basically 4 years ago and somehow his thicc body (especially everything below the waist lol) and confidence after pulling his team halfway into the night really fucking distracted me and I couldn't help but pay attention to him at 3 in the morning.
And boom within a few minutes he creeped me out and I got fucking scared he would grab me or something even though I could kinda tell some things weren't going through his head correctly. He did eventually leave me alone though after he saw me run away when he approached my team in the morning.
After that I never got the chance to visit the states again but one day a few months ago this friend of mine at Berkeley told me she met this dude named Clarence in the dining hall who was seems slightly interested in her but respected her boundaries unlike the Clarence I met.
She told me that she also heard about this Clarence creeping girls out when he was a freshman and he even mentioned it when they met but he told her a bunch of stories about how he managed to get himself to not harass anyone by actually just fucking following rules around harassment before trying to learn how to read signs and express interest. Definitely better late than never.
I wasnt sure if this was the same Clarence but then she told me he was this kinda stout CS major who used to go to a lot of hackathons... huh that seems familiar enough to try searching fb to corroborate. Sure enough, searching for Clarence Chen turned up the same ol thicc bloke with a bunch of fb friends going to Berkeley and a photo of him and his team actually winning some hackathon last year. She better be damn right about how he is now or else I'll be in for a big bummer.
So schoolwork and life came along and I didnt really care much anymore until I was procrastinating on MIT Confessions one day (yeah we arent only confined to subtle asian traits and tag yourself memes guys) and I found his ass making a bunch of surprisingly self-reflective comments about how #metoo intersects with his own experiences that align with what my friend told me. I mean there's always that chance I'm fooling myself but there's literally half a world between us and I dont think I'll ever find another nerd like you so I'll just shoot my shot and call it a day.
Clarence Chen, fucking hit me up mate and one day we might get a chance to cuddle and squeeze each other real good. But first you better be that changed man my friend promised me, and the next time you comment on MIT confessions please tone the false accusation obsession a bit for your own sake; there's a better time and place for that.

For once, I actually liked all of my classes and looked forward to going to class every day. I finally found the motivation that I’d lost some semesters ago. I even aced my midterms. I spent good quality time with friends and family and was overall very content. It felt so fking amazing. However, half way through the semesters, some issues came up and I couldn’t resolve them well. It was so fking sad and frustrating. I did slightly worse in my classes since then and just felt like shit half of the time. Anyway, I’m glad the semester is coming to an end.
It’s a little sad, but I’m so ready to leave Berkeley. This place has given me so much pain and agony that if I could go back in time, I would slap the shit out of myself for choosing this school. It kinda bothers me that I went to the No. 1 public university, but graduating from the No. 2 public university. We also never beat Stanford once during my 4 years here and I can’t decide which one is lower between my self-esteem and my GPA. Cal was my dream school, but a nightmare is a dream too I suppose.
Trash talk aside though, I think I’m gonna miss Berkeley and I’m grateful that I went to school here. I had the opportunity that a lot of people who wish they had don’t have. I’m grateful for the experiences I had, both good and bad. I met a lot of cool people here and made some good friends (hopefully for life but you never know). I wish I did a lil better in school and all, but I did learn quite a bit of things. I hope I’m ready to go out there and do stuff. Tbh, I’m so excited to finally be able to say that Cal is my alma mater and receive emails asking for donations.

So I'm a dude, and I was sexually assaulted by someone from my church a few years ago. It took a massive toll on me especially since I didn't tell anyone for a while. When word finally got out, my assault was swept under and the guy who assaulted me kept serving at church and it was never brought up again. I'm mostly over it by now, and I've opened up to friends, but I have a hard time telling them I'm still hurting inside from it all. I've been feeling lonely and depressed at times that I just hide it by having fun with my bros. It sucks, because when I told them I was just afraid they wouldn't know how to take it. I understand though, not everyone knows how to love on someone who was hurt in that way. I'm even more afraid that they might see me as a burden, but I don't want to be treated any different, I just need someone right now. It hurts...and it's lonely.

The combination of his insecurities and hers leads to manipulation on her part that takes advantage of his insecurities, where she does things such as assert her ""claim"" when he talks with other girls by being super kissy at social events or inserting herself into the conversation when he's talking with any of his female friends. The main thing she does that raises red flags (or more like red tapestries at this point) is that she goes through his phone and controls who he talks to and is friends with. Predictably, she makes sure that he doesn't talk with many girls, going as far as to block them on his social media to cut them out of ""her relationship"". She calls herself a raging feminist but this isn't what fighting for equality is. I suppose she's only a feminist when it's convenient to her. To the girlfriend if you're reading this: you're a hypocrite and a toxic person. So what if you have baggage? An explanation is not an excuse for the abuse you're subjecting my friend to.

2267574986852260,"1113. I’m honestly so over people who are complaining about CS61B. Like come the fuck on people. Everytime I mention this class, people just get so frustrated and upset, complaining that they’re struggling or that the class is too hard. First of all let me say, that by no means am I a coding god. I didn’t start coding at the ripe age of 3 years old, and I’m not the secret love child of Bill Gates and Elon Musk. My first exposure to CS was in AP CS which barely helped me here aside from the Java syntax it taught me. So I think it’s fair to say I really started doing CS when I entered college, so any complaints about “privilege” or “talent” are wasted on me. I did about average in 61A, but right now, I’m doing so well in 61B that it’s hard for me to imagine that people are even struggling in this class. The tests are worth jack shit and are even open book/notes. The projects are worth so much, and there are so many extra credit points to be earned. A lot of people could bomb the final and still come out with an A- or an A, so why are people even making this class out to be the devil? Now throughout this entire semester, I have not had any issues with the projects at all. As I’m sure many are aware, people keep complaining about the autograder, holding it and Hilfinger responsible for their woes and struggles. I will just make myself completely clear. That’s complete bullshit. These projects are not hard. They’re just long. As I said before, I’m no genius, but I was still able to get full points, plus extra credit on every single project. The key to these projects is just to start early, and not frantically try to complete it the day of the deadline. One would think people would have understood this after the first two projects, but no. Instead, they just wanna bitch and shift the blame. I get it. Blaming the system is easier than acknowledging your shortcomings, but at what point do you need to look at yourself and say, “Maybe I’m not trying hard enough” or “Maybe I need to change the way I approach this class.” People are always complaining about how the autograder screws them over because they pass tests on their machines but not on the autograder, to which I reply, write more fucking tests. Write better fucking tests. I am 100 percent with Hilfinger when he says the autograder isn’t a way to test your code. You should be testing your code and making it as exhaustive as possible. In the industry, there isn’t gonna be an autograder to make sure your code works, so you need to make your own tests. If you disagree, find a different major. It will give the rest of us better chances and quite frankly make life easier for everyone. If you’re not at least a little bit of a masochist, then CS is not the major for you. The weird thing is, people seem to be doing pretty well on the projects. The current statistics show that most people in this class are on track to get an A, even with a 50 percent minimum average on the final. So I’m guess all these people complaining about the autograder and the class are the minority population that would rather bitch and complain about the class rather than working harder and longer on the projects. At this point in the course, it’s already too late. You were a little slow to pick up on it. But to anyone wanting to take 61B in the Fall, I can wholeheartedly say that this class is the most fun and useful class I’ve ever taken since I came here. The projects are so much better than 61A and the focus on these projects makes for a more useful and better learning experience, rather than focusing on testing. These projects really give you the opportunity to not only apply your programming skills, but to also develop new ones to meet the task.","1113.

2266961553580270,"1101.So earlier today I was going to post on this page.
I just transferred here and felt kinda out of place but slowly began to make friends. One of my friends is this really talented, funny, and beautiful girl and we rather hit it off as far as friends go. I always had so much fun when I was around her and she helped me break out of my usual shy persona a bit. Obviously, as I am posting here you can imagine where this leads. A couple weeks ago I realized that I had developed a major crush on her. The problem being that she is totally out of my league.
Recently though, I had started to get the impression that she might like me back, but I was getting mixed signals since it seemed almost every time we talked she'd mention one of the six other guys who were into her and complain how she just hasn't found anyone she really connects with. I am generally bad at confronting people with my feelings, and having just gotten out of a relationship with an abusive partner, I was very hesitant to proceed.
Yet, at around noon today I drafted up basically everything above and was about to send it when I realized: wow I am a fucking loser. I always do this thing, where I wait way too long to admit to the girl I like that I like her and usually miss the chance to tell her, and here I am, instead of doing anything, anonymously complaining about how much of a wimp I am. So I vow to tell her next time I see her and just a few hours later she asks to meet for dinner.
Somehow I didn't chicken out like I always do and confessed that I like her. She, of course, didn't feel the same way, and my heart sunk rather a lot. I hope that I haven't made things too awkward for her, though because I truly love her as a friend and in hindsight I feel kinda stupid for jeopardizing our friendship which means so much to me already. I realize I was probably just projecting when I thought she was flirting with me.
But the world didn't end when I told her. Hopefully we'll still be friends and I will get over her sooner or later and we can go back to hanging out platonically, but I am pretty sure I survived, at least, I think I am writing this.
So to all you folks out there who haven't gotten the nerve to tell someone you like them, just do it already. Seriously, if my pathetic anxiety-ridden ass can handle rejection from the first girl I've liked in a while, so can yours. Go Bears!","1101.So earlier today I was going to post on this page.

I've been dating random ass guys forever, but nothing's stuck. When I tell him about them, I want to say, ""They all suck because they're not you"" but I can't. I got friend zoned so hard. I just wish he knew that I think he's perfect. Like, he's not the dictionary definition of hot, but tbh it hurts my heart to look at him.

Thank you. Thank you for cheating on me. Why am I thanking you? Because it gave me a reason to break up with you and made me truly realize how much of a piece of shit you are.
Even though you constantly had mood swings that consisted of ignoring me and being mad at me over absolutely nothing, told me I needed to go to RSF because you didn’t like my body, talked about how you wanted to be a fuckboy and wanted to experiment with other girls because I was just a “side bitch,” I still loved you. I thought I was being a loving girlfriend, but now I realize I was just being a dumbass. I was naive and stupid for giving up so much of my time to someone who made me feel worthless, insecure, ugly, and incompetent. You’re the reason that I now overthink everything in my relationships and can’t seem to accept the fact that someone could possibly like me because of who I am as a human. You are the reason I am broken, but I work everyday to make sure that someday, you and memories of you will no longer control any aspect of my life.
Now don’t get me wrong; even though I work everyday to recover from what you did, my life has been nothing but bliss since you walked out of my life and while I’m over here thriving without you, you can take your sorry ass and be the raving, cheating, hideous douchebag and fuckboy you’ve always wanted to be.
Good riddance and have fun making out with every ABG on this goddamn planet.","1099. To my ex-boyfriend:

2264743523802073,"1080. I posted on Piazza about the CS61B grading and asked whether or not there would be grade deflation due to the large number of higher scores on the projects. However, it wasn’t received as I expected, and my anonymous post ended up Overheard where it was just ripped apart by people. I didn’t intend to make myself sound arrogant and by no means was I trying to “flex” on people, but instead, I was genuinely concerned for grade deflation given the scores on the assignments. College classes can only have so many As. Everyone knows this. If there are too many As, professors will seem less credible and thus adjust the grading bins to account for this. In this world, only so many people can succeed. I’m terrified of this because I don’t think I’m one of those people that can succeed.
So when I look at my situation, all I can think is I’m just liked most other people, and we all won’t be able to make it. I was concerned that the extra credit and the large number of points given for the projects would lead to this, and thus voiced my concerns to Piazza. However, what I got was a bunch of criticism saying that people are struggling, and that I was a dick for even bringing up my scores and my situation in this class. I looked into the statistics for the projects and found that a majority of people scored high on the projects, but from the comments, it seems like most people are struggling and dying. Which is it? You can’t complain that your scores aren’t high and you’re struggling when the statistics show that’s not the case. It really seems like I may have just hit a sensitive spot during a stressful time, but understand that I don’t wish to make myself bigger or better than anyone in this class. I simply had a concern about my grade, and nothing else.
Also, if people construed my post as advocating for grade deflation, you’re very mistaken. I find solace in certainty, and my current situation gives me that. The threat of grade deflation will only take that away, so it’s the last thing I want, just like everyone else. I hope this clears up some confusion.","1080.

I'm someone who is fairly religious - I wish I could find a guy who's a good Muslim but tbh I stay the hell away from Muslim men at Berkeley. I also stay away from brown non-muslim guys too so it has more to do with culture than religion. I've grown up in a community with a shit ton of brown / middle eastern men and I've seen how deeply entrenched misogynistic cultural values are in their minds. They'll be fake to your face and pretend to respect women but when they think they're safe to express their true thoughts all they do is slut-shame and objectify women. Obviously slut-shaming and objectification is a slippery slope to becoming someone who abuses women - either physically or emotionally. And I'm cool off that... Like I've seen a LOT of shit and honestly, I wonder if there are ANY muslim guys who actually treat women right. I've seen Muslim guys who date girls and lead them on for something long-term or even use them for sex but then they go on to marry someone who is a ""good-girl"" and a virgin. I've seen Muslim guys who literally talk shit about every single little thing a girl does - how she's ""too flirty"" when she's just being a decent human being. I've seen Muslim guys who are homophobic and problematic AF as if they're superior to others (Side note: the Quran doesn't consider identifying as LGTBQ a sin. (In fact, people born with chromosomes other than XX and XY get to choose their gender) ...it does consider gay sex a sin - BUT it also considers pre-marital STRAIGHT sex a sin but y'all still do that so wtf gives you the right to be homophobic??? Like a LOT of things are considered sinful in Islam so don't pretend you're an angel who never sins. Get tf off your high horse - you don't get to deny someone's existence or treat them like shit because they do something the Quran considers a sin & you don't get to decide what sins matter more than other sins... only God is allowed to judge)
And this one is universal - men who think they have the right to dictate what their significant other can or can't do. How I dress, how I act, ANY of my decisions are NONE of your business unless I specifically ask for your opinion. You're supposed to RESPECT MY decisions, not make them for me.
I'm not trying to say that ALL Muslim men are not good people. My point is I've seen so many brown / Middle-eastern people who are so obsessed with their backwards-ass culture that I'm scared to interact with any of the Muslim men because I'm afraid I might fall for one who puts up a good front but really is a piece of shit and then find myself in an unhappy abusive marriage (I've seen it happen ladies)
And then there are the guys who label themselves Muslim but aren't religious. Like some of y'all are great and y'all might have strong morals but I really believe in God and I need to be with someone who believes in God too.
I feel like there might be some debate in the comment section on whether or not Islam is the culprit for women being treated like shit... I have one thing to say to this. Here's an example - there are SO. MANY. shitty and abusive men in India (not saying all of them, there are people who have adopted a ""modern"" Indian culture but the old-fashioned misogynistic culture still exists) and they aren't all Muslim - a lot of them are actually Hindu. So I think the overall connection to misogyny is the culture and not the religion(s).

2264301903846235,"1060. Hello everyone,
Recently, I did something sorta racist. I don't blame myself very much, due to the context of the situation, but I have long admitted to myself a persistent core of racism that I would like to eradicate, and this incident highlighted that. I've had a few black friends and family members, but over my life my interactions with black people have been limited compared to whites/Asians. (Not Hispanics/Latinx, but that's another conversation.) I thought a lot about it and thought I would solicit a conversation about race from one of the black members of the Berkeley community.
So I would like to have an in-person conversation in good faith about race with one of you. Please email this throwaway email thermos451@gmail.com if you'd like to chat. I'm interested in the history of race/racism, America's societal and governmental response, and the contemporary issues facing black people in America and worldwide.
While I DO want a lecture, I don't want a ""lecture"" in that I'm not going to sit through an hours-long accusation. Additionally, I would like to talk to someone who is well-educated in these matters, as I consider myself past the introductory level here. I can already tell you about the middle passage, redlining, the damage done to the black middle class in the Great Recession, etc. African American Studies majors would be ideal, I suppose.
Thank you. If I came off as arrogant, I apologize. I just want a very specific and elusive conversation and would like to solicit this from a position of anonymity. Best, ____.","1060. Hello everyone,

2262873207322438,"1044. *THIS IS A RESPONSE TO POST 1030*
To address each of your points (based on the paragraph divisions):
1) Asians do tend to be economically successful and well-represented in higher education, as are white people. The difference is that many Asians are poor 1st and 2nd generation Americans that uplift themselves into those positions through hard work and perseverance, whereas some white people find themselves in those conditions because they're blue-blooded trust fund bois with pedigrees who have pretty much never had to face discrimination in their lives. Just because Asians as a whole are in a better economic state than other POC doesn't mean that they're treated the same as white people. (And if that wasn't what you were implying with your argument, then why did you even bring it up?)
2) I'm really interested to know what privileges being Asian affords you in America; please elaborate. I'm not even being sarcastic, I just tried to think of some and couldn't really think of anything off the top of my head, but there probably are at least some.
3) I don't know what point you're trying to make here. Just because white women are white means that any discrimination they face because of their gender is invalidated because other groups suffer more? Again, you bring up how being Asian gives you privilege in some respects but then refuse to elaborate. And yeah, Asians are considered as people of color - the term ""person of color"" is literally defined as ""a person who is not white or of European parentage."" I don't know what else you would want us to identify ourselves as.
4) I can see the point you're trying to make here, but I don't think its really applicable to Asian Americans. Again, most Asian-American immigrants to America come from dirt-poor backgrounds so I don't think they're really benefiting much from the spoils of Chinese and Japanese colonialism (Contrast this with White America, a good chunk of whom profited either directly or indirectly from slave labor that was extorted from Blacks by their ancestors.) And if you're talking about the pain and suffering caused by this colonialism, I think that's a pretty flawed way of assigning blame. You said your people were ruled for a thousand years - I assume you're talking about China's domination of Vietnam, which started in 111 BC and ended in 938 AD. Well, I ask you, should the grandson of a Nazi war veteran be condemned for his grandfather's crimes, even if they do not share the same beliefs? I'm a Chinese-American, should I be condemned for my great-great-great-great-(I don't even know how many greats)-grandfather's crimes, even though I've never wanted to colonize Vietnam?
5) That's a pretty big generalization and follow-up assertion that you're willing to make there. I've met some Asian parents who do hold that belief, and I've also met some who do not. I certainly wouldn't say that Anti-blackness is ubiquitous among them. (To be fair, my sample size is only about 30 or so people, all from upper-middle class suburbia so its probably not safe to draw conclusions on it.) Overall, I find it interesting that you're willing to make such a one-sided assertion like that.
6) Well okay. We've reached the conclusion of your argument. The thing is, your entire spiel seems to be based off of the assumption that Asian Americans believe (and loudly whine) that they are the MOST oppressed and the MOST downtrodden. Now, maybe you and I come from radically different places and/or go to a radically different UC Berkeley(?), but I have never heard a single person of Asian descent utter that sentiment. Not a single one. And as an Asian male, I know quite a few Asians. I've heard people complain about stuff like affirmative action, but no one I know has ever said that Asians have it harder than Black people or any other people of color.
Overall, I think you just need to be more cooperative. As you said, we all have our own unique racial struggles, some of which occur on the personal level, and some of which occur on a societal level. Trying to assign levels and tiers to this stuff like you're doing is, ironically, only going to divide us more and impede social progress.","1044. *THIS IS A RESPONSE TO POST 1030*

2262872473989178,"1042. In response to 875 & other people with similar hurtful experiences. (This is not about GP specifically though but Christianity in general)
My heart hurts a lot knowing that a belief founded in love and sacrifice is often perceived and practiced in ways contrary. I saw comments mocking Christianity, calling it a cult, etc. and while I get where people are coming from it hurts my heart nonetheless. I myself am a Christian and not because of the church, in fact being anti-social, i dont even want to go to church activities. For the longest time i struggled with my gender/sexuality that deviated from most biblical teachings. I say this not to start debates but just to show I was at odds with Christianity. I couldn't understand that if God intended binaries then why would he create me the way I was and let me be attracted to the people I was.
I know a lot of people don't believe in the supernatural, but God has always existed like that for me. He literally saved me from dying several times in my life. At my lowest, I was planning my suicide mid semester. I was diagnosed with several mental and physical health issues. All my friendships never felt consistent/no one was okay enough to be there for me. But I heard God's voice. I saw him work (literal)miracles I'm my life and in people around me. I saw him love me even when I was everythin didn't see in the church: gay, gender queer, spiteful, etc. And so He is the reason i attend church, fellowship and other things I would've hated before.
I know this post won't answer all the tough questions and (seemingly) contradictions that Christianity seems to have. I just hope that maybe... just maybe it will give light that we are not just mindless drones, fulfilling laws to make ourselves happy. My God is real & is the only reason I'm alive & happy right now.

In response to 875 & other people with similar hurtful experiences. (This is not about GP specifically though but Christianity in general)
My heart hurts a lot knowing that a belief founded in love and sacrifice is often perceived and practiced in ways contrary. I saw comments mocking Christianity, calling it a cult, etc. and while I get where people are coming from it hurts my heart nonetheless. I myself am a Christian and not because of the church, in fact being anti-social, i dont even want to go to church activities. For the longest time i struggled with my gender/sexuality that deviated from most biblical teachings. I say this not to start debates but just to show I was at odds with Christianity. I couldn't understand that if God intended binaries then why would he create me the way I was and let me be attracted to the people I was.
I know a lot of people don't believe in the supernatural, but God has always existed like that for me. He literally saved me from dying several times in my life. At my lowest, I was planning my suicide mid semester. I was diagnosed with several mental and physical health issues. All my friendships never felt consistent/no one was okay enough to be there for me. But I heard God's voice. I saw him work (literal)miracles I'm my life and in people around me. I saw him love me even when I was everythin didn't see in the church: gay, gender queer, spiteful, etc. And so He is the reason i attend church, fellowship and other things I would've hated before.

I'm not really one to give advise on these kinds of things. But it sounds to me like like this person is someone who has made a huge impact on your life. I sort of know what you mean about not really knowing what you are, being scared to talk about it, but nonetheless appreciative of the relationship whether it's romantic or platonic. I'll tell you this, though: Talking about it is gonna be so much worth it. By how you describe this person, it seems like they're someone whom you've found a genuine connection with. I've been on this campus a little longer than I really should have, and I can tell you that type of connection is hard to come by. I'm sure many of us can tell based on past confessions.
I'm sorry I'm not that articulate or eloquent when it comes to these things. But I just wanted to tell you that, if you feel like you two are slipping away from each other, I hope that you would find the strength to talk to this person about it. They might still slip away, but they might also not. By the sound of it, this person sounds like they're worth the effort.
I wish you two the best. <3

A. This is for no. 942- you clearly are such an entitled person. As a fellow student who doesn’t pay anything to go to cal, let me ask you to please stop taking what you have for granted and judging others. When someone is complaining about their financial situation, they probably have a reason. People spend a lot to go here because they wanted to come to Berkeley and enjoy all the benefits that a Berkeley education provides. I’m floored that you were lucky enough to get a free ride to a top college and are so flippant about it. We should work to understand others’ struggles and be compassionate, not put them down for talking about their undeniably shittier situation.
B. In response to confession #942. Fuck you fucking bitch. I don’t pay tuition as well but it’s because I’m fucking poor as fuck and my family is poor as fuck. You clearly dont deserve the opportunity to be in this school (without paying tuition) if you don’t appreciate the opportunity and also understand how immensely privileged you are to be here. Your post was disgusting and gave me diahreeha so thanks for that you piece of shit.","1037.

A. @767 I know the post you wrote was uncomfortably familiar to a good number of people--myself included--but it really struck a chord with me. I've been feeling the same way about my best friend, too. I think about him every day, if he's doing alright, if he's eating his veggies, and if he's happy. I've learned so much from him, and he's made me a better person. I can truly say our period of friendship gave me some of the happiest times in my life. On the slight chance you're him: tell me something from our friendship that no one else knows. I can't keep living this sad, gray life much longer if I know you feel the same way.
B. To 767: I really want to believe this is my PS study buddy who I miss dearly. Drop some hints and I will totally give you a hug cuz our friendship is worth it. Miss you kid I hope you are doing good. I see you all the fricken time in passing but I just figured you’d rather I leave you alone so I just keep waking /:
C. To the OP of confession #767:
Somedays, I wish I could know if it was really you. We haven't spoken in a long time but I think about you every single day. Our time together was short but it was the only time in my two decades of life when I truly felt happy. Life was hard but we were there for each other. Now, I feel more distant than ever from not just you, but from everyone. I'm not religious but I do a little prayer every now and then hoping you'll somehow pop back into my life. I want to reach out but you were the one that pushed me away and I pushed back, and failed. I'm scared of trying again just to fail again; I don't know if I'll be able to live with myself if I make things worse than this void we have. I don't even know if you're with someone else now, but I wish we could just go back to being friends. Anyway, if you're reading this, I hope you're drinking lots of water too. I hope you're eating well and getting enough sleep, and doing all the things you set out to do before coming to Cal. I hope you're living your best life, and I'll always be thinking of you and cheering you on wherever you are, always and forever.","1033.

I think I should tell you something, what has been on my lips, in these recent weeks… something I always wanted to express to you (somehow, some time, in some possible way), I must put it in a very short simple message: Dear S. you are unhappy – and this is very obvious – because you constantly betray yourself. You constantly do not allow yourself to be yourself… You’ve put yourself – and all of your life – into the pattern of that old-fashion etiquette which is based on human experiences of a different era, different people, different social milieu, than yours.
You are one of those – naturally by birth – great idealists, to whom artists, utopians and politicians belonged just as well. People like Abraham Lincoln, Walt Whitman, Frank L. Wright, Thoreau, and many others – were born to be constantly misunderstood; to suffer through their lives of great discoveries, fighting with miserable middle-class mediocre mentality of their own compatriots, and of the rest of the world; people whose genius would be recognized too late.
You are a writer. Not that academic type of historian. You could write a great number of books – of your own philosophy. It was your own fault that you never allowed yourself to be what you are. To be what you’ve been born for.
S. … I wish you not to be ever so frustrated, hopeless and sad about yourself. You could just allow yourself really the way of life you want it – where you could totally separate yourself from the killing vanity of Irvine.
You do not need another award from some Historical Society. You have them all. One thing that would make you happy would be a book, where you could freely express yourself, your philosophy of history.
I am sorry we that I cannot join you on your journey but I wish you well on your ambitions for humanity.

Women heat their bodies less efficiently then men, it's why they're always so cold. If they had bigger brains and a penis the blood would always be flowing up and down within the body, and they'd be warmer. Since they don't have that, every cuffing season women go looking for a man who can provide body heat to get them through the cold months.
As a walking space heater, I open my doors for business every November, and immediately I'll get 4-5 tiny ABGs right off the bat. But you never go for the first round picks, trust me. The really hot girls come at the end of the semester. After they're done studying 24/7 in Moffit and go home and wash their faces for the first time in a month, it's the studious second round cuffers you want to go for. These girls will exploit you for your body heat, but they'll also cook the most delicious food and give like 4 star blowjobs every other week.
Cuffing season women don't stick around of course. Once it warms up in April they see me for what I actually am - Jabba the Hut with a Haas degree and an apartment his dad bought. Then all my cuffing season perks go away, but you know it's alright. I have sex 5 months out of the year, and the rest of the time I have so much liquid cashflow I can drink, smoke, and eat my troubles away. And it's all thanks to my business classes - at Haas I learned not to fixate on my weaknesses, but to capitalize on my strengths.

I feel so guilty because I think I'm the reason we're not friends anymore. I'm the type of person who can (and usually will) be friends with anyone. I have different friend groups but am really close to a few people across the groups. I'm the definition of an extrovert; she is an introvert. I think she got closer to me than I was to her, but simply because she had more time to give than I could reciprocate. She was the type to find the loud, partying, girly types as annoying and superficial. Most of the girls at our old school were like that, so I could see where her annoyance was rooted, but I am that type of girl. I love going out, being loud, shopping, getting ready for a party, then getting wild at said party. I often felt as though she wasn't friends with that part of me. Anyway, she made me the best graduation gift ever, full with pictures of us spanning our entire friendship, each captioned with an inside joke. And I completely ghosted her. A part of me thinks its because I was insecure with our friendship--maybe our personalities just weren't meant to get along. Either way, I feel awful for never hitting her up. She is sooo so smart, motivated, wise, and has direction. We had a healthy competitive friendship in high school, and I think she's part of the reason as to why I did so well in high school. Now she's at UCLA and I'm here; she's getting straight A's and I'm struggling to get C's; she's growing up and I'm stuck. Stuck in the past, in high school, and idk I just miss our friendship. After high school ended I made absolutely no effort to hang out with her. Why? God knows. I feel like such an asshole, but I guess I deserve the feeling of loss and guilt since I was the worst friend to her. I texted her a while back and was left on read. I guess it's time to move on.","1016. I miss my old best friend. We were friends from middle school up until the end of senior year in high school.

I didn't think too much of the first wedding, since it was my very first wedding that I attended to, until the second wedding, when it was the EXACT same as the first one, and then that's when I started to really think about it. At the first wedding, I didn't really know the groom or the bride, so I thought it was weird how I was invited. I went anyways, and the very first thing I noticed was the amount of people from the church that was there. The second weird thing was that they didn't even exchange vows, or get this, even KISS. I remembered thinking ""wait, it's over?"" when people started clapping and they started walking down the aisle together. Then it was the ""wedding party."" The first thing I noticed was that they legit had no photos of them together. They also wrote down a confession letter admitting their wrongdoings and sins to their parents where they read out loud and cried to everyone, which I thought was really weird. Also, the dancing and the videos. There were so many dance performances by the people in the church, and they were so bad and cringy. They also made videos impersonating the bride and the groom, as some sort of comedy portraying how they were before they got married. I didn't thought that the dancing and the videos were weird until the second wedding, when they did the exact same thing. At the very end, they started to promote free bibles and Christian books, and started offering these books as gifts to the people that came. It seems as if even at their own wedding, they can't stop evangelizing. The second wedding was different in the sense that I actually knew the groom pretty well, or at least I thought. I remembered joking with him how he was never gonna find a wife, and then a week later he sends out an email saying I was invited to his wedding? Like what the fuck? The worst and most shocking part was that he was getting married to another member of the church that I knew pretty well too, but I never thought they were engaged since they NEVER talked or hung around each other. I was kind of hurt by this, but I just brushed it off back then. Like I said before, the second wedding was the exact same as the first wedding (no vows, no kissing, no photos, letters to their parents, dances and videos, evangelizing). I wouldn't even be surprised if they used the same wedding dress.

Some of it is done jokingly, and that's fine, but I know for a fact that there are people here who have legitimately racist views toward white people. (Also, the argument that it is *impossible* to be racist to white people or sexist to men is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard of. Racism and institutional racism aren't one and the same.)
Yes, white privilege is a real thing. All else equal, a white dude probably has an easier time socially, faces practically no discrimination, etc. I don't dispute that.
But you know what else is a form of privilege? Having a loving family. Being born to well-off parents. Having good schools as a kid. All of those are way bigger sources of privilege than being white.
You know even bigger sources? Being attractive. Look at the data, attractive people are constantly privileged in the workplace, in personal attractions, in finding a significant other (obviously).
Hell, literally no one talks about it, but being intelligent is the biggest source of privilege of them all. Being able to do well in classes, go to a good college, excel in a career, and make money? All of that requires intelligence. To be born a genius is legitimately the greatest privilege someone could ever have. And most of your intellect is either determined by your genes or your upbringing in the first few years of your life. Neither of those are things you can control.

2259252194351206,"992.5. I'm 875. I ranted about Gracepoint AKA the cult on campus, and I would just like to clarify a couple of things. Yes, I understand the point of a church is to recruit more members, and that's totally fine if they had come off that way. But they didn't. When I was first approached by some members of Gracepoint, they didn't even mention their church. They struck up a conversation with me and then they invited me to go bowling with them. At first, I thought it was really weird and sus that strangers were inviting me to something when I literally just met them, so I declined, but agreed to exchange contact information. One of them hit me up a couple days later, and we started talking. He then invited me to a bbq at his place, which I went to and it was a lot of fun. I met a lot of new people and back then I really felt like I could build lasting friendships with these people. But the next time they asked me to hangout was for ""bible study time and laser tag,"" and that's when they told me they were part of this fellowship on campus. At first, I was really disappointed and I straight up told them that I wasn't a Christian, but then they said they didn't mind and that a lot of their members weren't Christian (not true), so I still decided to go, since back then I was a lonely freshman with nothing to do. Fast forward, I decided to stick with the church anyways because of the people I met and I was starting to get interested in Christianity. I went to a lot of their retreats, ate with them, hung out with them, and studied with them. Fast forward some more, and I was no longer interested in Christianity, and decided that it was best to leave the church since I was only going for the food and games. Now, if you met some friends at a club, and if you happen to leave the club, if they were true friends, you would still most likely be friends with them, right? Well, that didn't happen for me. Once I stopped going, they slowly stopped hanging out with me. At first, they still invited me to some events, but it was all Christian related so I kept saying ""no."" And when I asked them to hangout, a lot of the times they couldn't cause they have ""life group"" or ""bible study"" or ""service"" or ""the friday night"" or ""devotional time"" or whatever cult bullshit that they had to do that was taking over their lives. So I can't tell if they were fake af or if the church is just taking over their lives, but either way it's both bad and I was still hurt at the end, since the people I thought were truly my friends no longer say hi to me anymore ever since I left the church. Again, this doesn't explain why it's a cult, just my experiences, but the church really does have some cult-ish practices. All you have to do is look at the 1/2 starred Yelp reviews. Based on my experiences, they're all true.

2259242777685481,"988. My girlfriend is the most amazing and beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life. We’ve been together since high school and there have definitely been rocky moments, as in every relationship, but I can definitely say that I haven’t loved anyone so much in my entire life so far (except of course my family). Given that it’s my first relationship, there were concerns between the both of us that I hadn’t had enough relationship experience to know that I’m in the right one, but honestly, I really truly think I am. I’m so glad we were both lucky enough to go to Berkeley together. She gives me the most love and support I could ask for and even the days where I feel sad or stressed about whatever Berkeley now decides to throw my way, she’s always there. Like no matter how her day is going or what she has to do, she’s there to provide a listening ear and advice not just to me but all of her friends. She’s just a wonderful person and I, seriously, cannot imagine being in the same place that I am now without her. Being able to cuddle her and play with and smell her hair at the end of the day is one of the most relaxing, stress-relieving things I think ever. Sometimes she doesn’t realize how much she means to me or how much of an impact she has on who I am because I think I have performed well academically and never show the outward signs of stress or doubt that others might. We’ve talked about our plans and life after college and she’s becoming a larger and larger part of that picture, especially in recent months. I know it’s premature to make such a large decision at a relatively young age but I know she’s the one for me. It’s a little scary thinking about marriage and starting a family because that’s all after college and it seems so far away, but I know as long as she’s there, it’ll all work out.
It might seem that Berkeley never stops beating you down but there is an end and there is happiness out there. Don’t let classes or exams blind you from everything life has to offer. Go Bears!","988.

2259240857685673,"984. I'm an exchange student. This is my first and last semester. At first, I felt rather excited about the whole new life here. Ppl are soooo friendly greeting you all the time. Even if I won’t stay here for long, I joined a club! Undoubtedly, I felt like I was in a new big warm family, though it was also a pretty hard time to understand people bc of language.
But later, something changed. I was desperately attracted to someone in the club, who is iridescent n charming af, who doesn’t share the same feeling to me at all, who I even could hardly have a chance to chat with. I’m kinda shy in expressing affections but I tried so hard and finally got the guts to do sth for her. Sadly, what I got back every time is a bare n simple “thank you” n No More. Our convo never exceeds 5 sentences. She’s like a perfect topic-terminator. Besides in the club, I feel like everyone see me as a total outsider. Every time when someone says sth and turn back and see it’s me, they’d immediately swerve their eyes to others, like I’m the evilest devil??
I do admit that sometimes I couldn’t catch up with what natives are talking about, but I AM ALSO AN ADVANCED ENGLISH LEARNER.
Having been isolated/ignored so long, the only thing I could do is praying for a descent ending of my USA trip. I should’ve killed my silly thought about her in the cradle.","984.

I think the whole rhetoric of pro Israel or Palestine is very toxic & only serves to stymie conversation & polarize the issue. So because I’m not one of those zionists that give the Jewish community here and everywhere a bad rep in progressive spaces, I am in quite a few spaces you would consider either progressive or radical campus. I also am a part of an affinity group at Hillel, because as a Jew in college you have few choices to engage with your community outside of talking about Israel Palestine beyond the Jewish student centers, which are both pro-Israel. Might be worth a side note to say that my mom is not Jewish & Chabad doesn’t even think I’m Jewish because of orthodox traditions. So I go and talk to people in these progressive spaces about a program I am helping put on at Hillel to serve a minority population in jewish spaces here, knowing the risk of getting labeled an Israel apologist or Zionist. No one really reacts negatively, but I can just see the judgment from
them that I’m doing a thing at Hillel. It is very frustrating to me that because of pro-Israel activists monopolizing jewish spaces here, I cannot practice my religion, engage with my community and talk about my Judaism without folx giving me a side eye in progressive spaces.

There is nothing more disgusting and revolting in life than a man who doesn't have a good job and doesn't earn a lot of money.

For awhile now I've been ""putting myself out there"" or whatever, trying to build relationships or friendships. I wouldn't even care I don't have a romantic relationship if I had a good friendship; in fact, I'd prefer the friendship. I try to be a good person, to respond to those texts, to make myself available, to remember our conversations, to keep anything personal said to myself; you know, all the basic, not-hard-but-important shit. But instead of this sentiment being returned, it's ignored: my messages are ignored, ""lol sorry I'm so busy"" is followed by no effort to reschedule whatsoever, forgetting important shit about me I've told you three times already, not keeping anything I say private.
At first I thought it was me, that I was being too insistent or I said something wrong or whatever. And I tried to fix myself, until I realized I wasn't really the problem. If you don't wanna hang or don't like me or whatever, can't you just say it? Do you think I'm so fragile that I can't handle a pseudo-rejection from someone I met just a few days ago? And I get that pretty much everyone at Berkeley is busy: we have ridiculous classes, midterms all the time (what's the point of the term ""midterm"" if there are like three of them? isn't that just a test at that point?), homeworks, projects, clubs, internships and labs and career stuff, mandatory partying to relieve stress, all that shit. But I'm busy too. The point is to put aside just a bit of time (even like 15-20 minutes) to maintain a relationship. If you can't even TRY to do that, you're fucking lying. Nobody is too busy to be a decent person. And I'm done straining myself for people that don't give a damn about me.","923. I'm done putting effort into people.

Please comment below (if this confession does make it through the administration board) whether you would consider this to be an act of incest. Things I will say about the experience is that 1. It was mutual and consensual at the time 2. I never went anything past first base (a.k.a. kissing) and 3. This was a long time ago.

To the people submitting confessions regarding heartbreak/missing someone who left/wishing things were like ""old times"" or whatever: I understand it sucks to feel that way, and of course your feelings are valid, but before you continue to wallow in self pity, ask yourself if you really, truly did care about the person you miss so much. Seriously, though, did you? Do you? You're probably thinking ""yeah no shit, honey"" but it's really not that simple. Caring for someone is not getting upset when they don't reciprocate your feelings. It's not ignoring the other person's feelings for the sake of your own. It's definitely not emotionally manipulating someone into being friends or more than friends with you. When on the confessions page, I sometimes read paragraphs that sound so obsessive, and it makes me feel bad for the other person! It's awful feeling like you have to be there for someone in order to save them, to spare their feelings, especially when you yourself do not have the emotional capacity to care for another person! Please, don't put someone in that situation. Learn to be happy through something else. Find a hobby or something, some type of distraction, literally anything that will help you move on. People fuck up, all the time, so you really can't depend your entire happiness and well-being on another person. Your idea of whatever relationship was there may not have been a reality, and you can't hold it against the other person.","910.

It took me a lot of time to really get up to speed with everyone and meet the pace of the academics here. it was really something that I aspired to reach. Halfway through my first semester at Cal I really think I did make it happen. Everything was going really well actually. It was great. I had a great group of friends in Ida Sproul in Unit 3, I had tons of friends in different organizations that I was itching to join. It was all going well but when I decided to try and join one of these organizations in the spring of my freshman year I got rejected from each and every one. That didn't really deter me though. I had faced hardship in the past and definitely have and will continue to take it step by step to make my life better. I looked at my peers and was inspired. I spent a lot of that spring semester trying to overcome the unhappiness that I fell into when I got rejected from all those clubs. It was really kind of eye opening. After that happened I focused on myself. I started working out a ton, I quit eating out, I woke up at 7am every day to run through my upcoming lecture material before I actually got to class. Life started picking up. I still managed to make time to hang out with some friends on weekends but for the most part I was just grindin'! My routine all changed when I met this girl. Man this girl. She was something else. She's from out of state and we really connected about everything. She had the most beautiful smile and could corner me in a debate even if she was blackout drunk. Super hot, super intelligent, and honestly great sex. It was something out of a dream. We kept it going for about a year but then it all ended when I found out she just didn't love me anymore. I honestly would have rather us have gotten into a giant fight or something. Ah but alas my life spiralled into pain and hurt and anger. I didn't really know how to talk to my friends about it. I can't even really describe the pain I felt. Honestly if I were to try, the closest thing I believe that would even come close to that kind of pain is when, in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.","909.

How fucking brain dead and inconsiderate can you be to shave yourself in a shared bathroom, and just leave your shit there for everyone to deal with. I know since we're UC Berkeley students we often refer to ourselves as Bears, but with the amount of hair you left in that shower, I'm starting to think that term may fit all to well. And how the fuck did you manage to get hair on every single wall in that tiny ass shower? Did you shave yourself and decide it wasn't enough to just leave it on the floor and instead decided to sprinkle it on the wall in a half-assed attempt at art? Did you shave yourself and decide it would be a funny way to mark your territory? After contemplation, I have concluded that somewhere, in this building, in a reasonable vicinity from floor 2, there is a fucking chimpanzee living here, who decided to climb onto the shower curtain rail and shave himself, letting his hairs just rain down and coat the shower in its entirety. In my 19 years of life, I've seen a lot of stupid, incoherent shit, but this definitely gets up there, and no, you should not be proud of this achievement. Not only did you lack the consideration for others living on the floor, but you also left a mess for the custodial staff who already have to deal with a lot of bullshit on this floor. And don't even think ""oh it's their job, it's not a big deal.""

At this point, I know it’s all water under the bridge for you. But every now and then, I see you around and it still triggers the fuck out of me. So I’m writing this confession to explain why.
It’s not because you hurt me or because you moved on so quickly. It’s because seeing you reminds me of how happy you used to make me, of the what if’s and could’ve been’s. Most importantly, seeing you reminds me of the worst version of myself – too insecure to tell you how I felt and too depressed to tell you what I needed.
All I need from you now is for you to know that I don’t hate you. Yes – I hate that you let me push you away, that you got back with your ex, and that you never reached out to see how I was doing. But no – I don’t hate you.
The reason I blocked you was to stop myself from ruining your life. Granted, I was suffering from severe depression. But I refused to be that girl drunk-texting you, showing up at your door months after you’d moved on, or calling you to threaten suicide. I wasn’t gonna let myself be the girl who held you back, but I almost was.
So next time you catch me avoiding you, just know that it’s not because I hate you; it’s because I hated myself too much to love you the right way. And know that I meant it when I said that I missed you and that I hoped we could be friends again sometime in the future. But for now, I've come too far to be reminded of losing you. So let’s just continue to be strangers.","898.

I know I shouldn't expect anyone to be perfect, and I don't, but I feel like such a hypocrite sometimes because I know I probably don't even meet my own standards.
The other problem is that even if I did meet ""the one"", sometimes I can be so awkward it hurts.

2247721955504230,"845. *This is relevant to the amount of posts that have been popping up lately. I would appreciate if this was posted so that the discussion on this matter is not so one-sided towards asian females who state opinions that offend asian males, who respond sadly in the post. A thorough discussion is necessary because there's no question that this specific mindset is becoming outspokenly accepted or at least more prevalent in society.
Note: I apologize for the continuation of this topic as it has been brought up so many times on this page and in media and so on so forth, but I think I have additional thoughts to bring to the table regarding the subject of interracial dating between white males and asian females.
I grew up in the Bay Area where I was surrounded with only asians. All my crushes up until the end of my senior year in high school were asians, so to say that I am not attracted to asian men would be a huge lie. That being said, my track record for dating, romantic flings, hook-ups, or relationships in the last few years have all been with Caucasian men. My current relationship is with the stereotypical white, 6'2, blue-eyed man who means the world to me but not for the reason that he's white. Hear me out.
For a while, I played into the narrative that I was only into white guys, I'd only ever be into white guys. Where did that idea even come from? When has it become socially appropriate again for any person to discriminate on the color of ones skin? Where is line drawn with difference between a preference and racial discrimination? I don't know but I think this is a topic that should be explored further.
If we want to define discrimination:
""Unfair treatment or bias against someone or a group of people on the basis of their race"". While there may be no unfair treatment against asian men from these asian women, outwardly stating a whole race of men is worth less in your eyes compared to another, based on mainly physical appearance, is discrimination. (You can for sure state behavioral differences but that generalization below is an act of heavy stereotyping.) I am not saying anyone is a racist so don't get defensive but we all have witnessed discrimination. A lot of us as asian women know what it's like to be minorities, to be discriminated against, so why are we attempting to make the members of our own race feel what we would not wish on ourselves?
If we want to explore this from varying perspectives, perhaps, we'll reach some form of closer clarity:
a) I know for a fact that I have heard several white male friends of mine state, to my face, that they would only ever date white girls or that they find white girls superior in looks or attractiveness and ""creating great genetic offspring"". In hearing that, I have always listened in silence and tried to accept that a ""preference' is a ""preference"". And so what if it is just a preference? Do we want this type of conversation to be normalized? It is hypocrisy to the max to be offended by the opinions of these guys without realizing that asian men feel the same way when asian women say that they only date white men. Think about this, place yourself in another's shoes, next time you state anything of the sort.
b) To asian women who only want to date white men:
Let me put it straight that there is nothing wrong with interracial dating. Good on you! But if you meet a guy who isn't white who happens to meet all of your requirements, treats you so well, shares the same life visions as you, would you dismiss him because he isn't white? What bothers me most is that for women who say they won't date anyone but white men, it really illuminates the issue because you have now openly stated that race is your number one filtering priority. You would rather eliminate some amazing men as a result of their racial make-up rather than eliminating based on one's character. That is, in reality, a short-sighted pathetic decision.
c) We hear so much about the history of asian women fetishization and I've definitely learned about it in history classes here at Cal (ps, not a history major so I don't remember the details) but it's a genuine issue rooted throughout history and portrayed in media. But in the recent years, are we maybe perhaps fetishizing white males? ""Racial fetishism involves fetishizing a person or culture belonging to a race or ethnic group. This can include having strong racial preferences in dating."" -Wikipedia is a terrible source to quote but it explains what a racial fetishism can consist of.
Read the many posts in the confessions below.
""My primary goal in life is to have half-asian children. Even if this selective breeding themed desire is messed up in the eyes of general society, I think it actually makes sense biologically because my offspring will be premier specimens in that they'll have the best of both worlds in being both attractive and smart (not that white people are dumb or asian people are ugly). Oh man, am I a eugenicist?""
That's your primary goal? Maybe we ought to all make our visions grander than marrying a white man (:
d) One more thought I would like to share after having stated the above. For the asian women who say they will only date white men, it brings an extremely skewed perspective onto existing asian female and white male relationships. That isn't to say some of those relationships do compose of asian females who will only date white men but the number of times I have gotten heavy backlash for dating a white man, (not just from asians but also men of other ethnicities), is frequent. I have had men automatically categorize me as ""that type of girl, the one who wants to move up the ladder""
and here, texts directly to me from individuals who had wanted to be with me and when I told them I had a boyfriend (whom I had been dating for 2 years at this point already) and they realized he was white, said the below:
""Have a nice life i hope your friends in family love your white boyfriend deep down inside your racist goodbye, never gave me a chance because your boyfriend is caucasian to the public eye he is more accepted in ok but its fine with me just know that you disrespected me first in coundn't look pass my dark skinn to see what i am about instead you friend zone me shows that your a liar in a racist in you only date white males to get ahead in society your a racist bitch""
No. I'm letting you know that the narrative that certain asian women spew about only being with white men is selective to those individuals. Whether or not that is discriminatory or not, those opinions are specific to those types of girls who believe the bullshit that white men are actually better than asians. The act of an asian women being with a white guy in a wholesome relationship that does not revolve around race at all and has never revolved around race, does not make the asian woman a social-climbing racist.
It's such a complicated matter and a tough bridge to navigate but I hope this is fruitful as a starter for a solid conversation.","845. *This is relevant to the amount of posts that have been popping up lately.

and here, texts directly to me from individuals who had wanted to be with me and when I told them I had a boyfriend (whom I had been dating for 2 years at this point already) and they realized he was white, said the below:
""Have a nice life i hope your friends in family love your white boyfriend deep down inside your racist goodbye, never gave me a chance because your boyfriend is caucasian to the public eye he is more accepted in ok but its fine with me just know that you disrespected me first in coundn't look pass my dark skinn to see what i am about instead you friend zone me shows that your a liar in a racist in you only date white males to get ahead in society your a racist bitch""
No. I'm letting you know that the narrative that certain asian women spew about only being with white men is selective to those individuals. Whether or not that is discriminatory or not, those opinions are specific to those types of girls who believe the bullshit that white men are actually better than asians. The act of an asian women being with a white guy in a wholesome relationship that does not revolve around race at all and has never revolved around race, does not make the asian woman a social-climbing racist.
It's such a complicated matter and a tough bridge to navigate but I hope this is fruitful as a starter for a solid conversation.",,1543258801,,,45,18,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2247721955504230&id=2156420374634389,

I tend to be pretty sociable with close friends but have trouble talking to new people by myself without enough alcohol to seem like an asshole, so dating and shit is pretty hard. When I see people around me in couples, friends or just random people, I can get pretty down about myself and feel very inadequate or unlovable. It comes and goes but when I see people doing cute couples stuff or when friends talk about their sex lives with me sometimes it just makes me feel terrible. I used to get really angry on the inside about it but obviously that's not healthy so I've been trying not to feel that way but I just kind of get depressed about it now. At the same time, I know I should feel happy for everyone around me, I would never ask people around me to change their behavior for what is entirely my problem, and I genuinely feel glad that people are happy to talk about their relationships or hookups with me. It's great for people to feel sexually liberated and unashamed about it, whatever that means for you (consent and safe practices implied, obviously). But it really does make me feel so much worse about myself when people just casually bring up who they fucked last night or the awesome date they went on with their significant other. Then I just feel like a bad person for making it about me or being a self pitying fuck and you can probably see how it goes from there.
I feel like I'm getting better about this and if you feel anything similar I truly believe anyone can turn this kind of thing around with a growth mindset and maybe some weed, it just takes time. But in the meantime it's pretty fucking garbage being the 7th wheel when you hang out with friends. Btw if you don't like ""these kinds of confessions"" see the above comment.","814.

2244538055822620,"788. To all the people who confess about having bad luck in dating/hooking up due to their looks: I won't lie, physical attraction is incredibly important in these situations, but I think y'all don't realize how much personality goes into attraction as well. I had a friend who I always found cute, smart, funny, and creative (my type is definitely dorky/nerdy when it comes to guys) and I was really into the idea of hooking up with him! So I got to know him better (I didn't want to proposition out of the blue since we weren't strangers) and... yikes. Most of the time, he's awesome, fun to talk to, sincere, intelligent, but he'd often find ways to work in thoughts like, ""No one besides my mom thinks I'm handsome"", or ""I'm really ugly without clothes on because I'm fat"", or ""I really wanted to have that stereotypical college dating experience instead of being the stereotypical EECS boy"" and it was SUCH. A TURNOFF. And I had been totally attracted to him!
Don't get me wrong, emotional vulnerability and honesty are wonderful traits to foster within yourself, and I totally struggle with my mental health and confidence too, but if you continuously find ways to turn your daily conversations into therapy sessions... I'm outta here. I didn't sign up for this shit. That isn't fun for a friend, and it's definitely not fun for a hookup/date. And I'm saying this from personal experience, because I've BEEN that gal who complained about how ugly and lonely she was. It's human to be insecure and it's human to want companionship! However, don't look to sex or dating to give you self esteem or happiness. Only you can give that to yourself. If you don't think you're attractive (and I don't just mean physically), why should anyone else?","788.

I thought at a place like Cal, this sort of mindset would be a given, but more often than not, I see a facade. I'm talking about taking seriously questions that should drastically change your life if there's even a slight tweak in the answers. Questions like what is the meaning of life? Why is something right or wrong; or is there such a thing? Am I accountable for my actions? Is there a higher power? I've found that people usually have a great time discussing these topics, and they are usually fully engaged throughout the discussion, but the brain juices seem to stop once the conversation is over. Even after a debate and there's even confirmation on both sides of one side's stance, the other side just nods their head in agreement but no significant effort is made towards further research or a mind/life change. It's really just a fun, mental exercise with no real life application, but I don't get how that's possible when dealing with fundamental life philosophies. Your dreams, your ethics, your sense of justice, the causes that you flyer for on Sproul, your reason for even pursuing a degree at Cal; really, your whole life depends on these fundamental questions. And yet, people just live lives too busy to look up to see where they're going when they could very well be going down a very wrong path and not even know it. But, I guess I understand that letting your life's foundations be tested and shaken is a scary thing, so to do it requires a lot of grit and self-honesty. So, I guess I just wanted to write this up to encourage you to really put in that extra effort to think, listen, research, and really iron out your philosophies so that you are headed in the right direction with your lives.","782.

She was so nice and seemed genuinely interested in what we were talking about which is something I feel is lost at times. When we were trying to solve an issue with the lab, she listened to what I had to say and was super helpful. Even though we've only worked exclusively together that one time, I still look at it fondly. She has this aura of good vibes about her and it brightens up my day when I see her walk into lab. Aside from being an overall cool person, she's extremely beautiful with a smile that makes you feel like everything is going to be alright, which is really helpful in a lab that can be occasionally very stressful.
I would love to be able to tell her these things, or even just say hello, but I am extremely shy and would find a way to royally mess it up. I promised myself every week since that first week that I would go up to her and ask her out. It's been nearly a whole semester and with only a few more labs left, I'm running out of time to say something. At this point, I'm not sure if I have it in me to do it. I'm afraid that I'll back out and she will just end up being that beautiful girl I happened to cross paths with for a brief time in lab.","779. This semester, I met this girl in my lab class.

I haven't had a real relationship, didn't join any clubs for my own (non-career) interests, hell, almost all the friends I've made are people I *work* with consistently. And now that I'm about to graduate, I wish I had taken the time to meet more people. I wish I had time to sit on the glade at midnight looking at the stars and talking about philosophy, or joined AFX, or started a band, or done something else. I wish I had built real, close friendships instead of simply working relationships with others.
While I'm professionally in a place that most people would be incredibly envious of, it's hard to tell others about the opportunity cost. After all, I would just be mocked for complaining about doing well for my career. But because everybody sees me as fulfilled, I've lost what matters most: close, real, human connection. I would give anything to turn back time and focus on making those true friends instead of focusing on myself.
To all you EECS/CS/Haas/etc. majors that spend all their time ""networking"" and doing ""side projects"" and all, make sure you consider what you truly value.

It turns out that he's a total jerk (and a player). He refused to talk to me after the incident, pushed me aside and completely disregarded my feelings. He also started messaging other girls, trying to coerce them into having sex with him.

Why does Berkeley receive less applications than UCLA, UCI, and UCSD now? If Berkeley grads have higher starting salaries than UCLA grads, how come UCLA can raise a record-breaking average of $1.05 billion annually while Cal's best year (2017-2018) has been $569 million? Could it be that at one large public institution students feel at least somewhat cared for while at the other students feel completely neglected?
I understand the Big Game is important for school revenue and many students might be just memeing and trying to get out of school for a day. But there are serious health concerns here for many students and the administration could certainly prove us all wrong and show that it cares by at least handing out masks for free.
In the long term, this mistake will just be another one to add to the pile when they struggle to fundraise and attract a diverse student body/culture that frankly, is one of the only reasons why I chose this school. When that happens, will they have the funds to keep attracting world class talent and graduate students?
I hope Carol and Co. learn their lesson from this and finally start prioritizing student wellness, health, and safety instead of just talking big game about it. But I know that's too much to expect from them. Maybe they'll change their tune when the numbers finally start staring at them in the face. It's a shame because by the time that happens, it might be too late to turn things around at an otherwise great school.

So be it, I will confess. Perhaps this post will be enough to rid me of the dark deeds that weigh so heavily upon my soul.
Forgive me Cal, for I have committed the sin of Lust. For, when I look upon Oski, a great fire is stirred up in my loins, and I am plagued by a desire from which I know respite in neither waking day nor restless night. In the day, I can't stop thinking about those white gloves running up and down my body, and at night, his handsome, hairy visage haunts my dreams, where I embrace him and and whisper sweet nothings into his petite, brown ears.
Forgive me Cal, for I have committed the sin of Gluttony. For, whether I hunger or not, I am compelled to go to Crossroads, where I gorge myself ceaselessly. Every bite tastes to me like the ambrosia of the gods, and so I horde my mounds of food into my boxes, without a care for the gentle laborer who produced it nor for my fellow students with whom I must share it.
Forgive me Cal, for I have committed the sin of Greed. For, when my peers would inquire whether today's midterm was next month on Piazza, I would stay silent or give false answers, in the hope of curving the grading scale to my own advantage. Oh the lives that I have doomed with my wretched selfishness!
Forgive me Cal, for I have committed the sin of Sloth. For I have wasted many an hour away browsing UC Berkeley Memes for Provocative Adolescents, all the while forsaking the sworn duties that I have to my major. How many sacred oaths to my professors have I broken? How many hours of sleep have I lost through my procrastination? These are more numerous than the stars in the sky, and than the tears of contrition that stream from me now.
Forgive me Cal, for I have committed the sin of Wrath. For I have angry-reacted to a great deal of posts on Eavesdropping at UC Berkeley, and the anger that I then felt burned hot enough to singe my very soul.
Forgive me Cal, for I have committed the sin of Envy. For upon learning that our public university was only ranked second to some other, I felt a great jealousy and scorn towards those that had been ranked first. Countless times I wished that a fault would split California's southern coast asunder, so that those devils might be cast into the sea! Countless times I called upon the Sun to turn their tans into melanoma, and upon the Moon to rob their beaches of fortuitous tides! How monstrous I was!
Forgive me Cal, for I have committed the sin of Pride. For when I was accepted into Berkeley over my safety school at Stanfurd, I lorded myself over them, and thought of them as lesser rubes! I turned upon those who once were my brethren and thought myself to be above them, jeering that their school would suck eggs, and laughing audibly as I did so.
There. It's all out. The misdeeds that stain my character, all laid out plainly. Whether there can be forgiveness for a wretch such as I, I know not. But I dare to hope...","742.5. A Confession, eh? A chance to cleanse myself of sin?

Anyway, this is to the people in the UC Berkeley libraries (especially Moffitt) who leave their things in chairs for more than a fucking hour to save their seat. I sit in the library for a very long time and I notice stuff that's literally been left there for fucking hours. When I say multiple hours, I mean I stay at the library for 5-7 hours sometimes and I see shit not moved in that amount of time. You guys have the fucking balls and entitlement to leave your shit there and assume no one will steal your shit. My problem personally, and maybe other people's problem is that people want to sit there too. It is frustrating to walk around the library like an idiot just to find a place to study. Not everyone lives on/near fucking campus and they need a place to stay sometimes and when the library is occupied by someone who isn't even there it's really fucking annoying. They come to the libraries for solace to help them study, but you guys are making the library isolating when all should be welcome. I've opted out to just move their shit. I stopped giving a fuck. You can't hog a fucking seat, we all pay fucking tuition (or at least someone is paying for it). One last thing, don't sit in front of a screen/computer that you aren't using. People need to use it too, and if you do that you are depriving someone that could be using it. You don't own the fucking college, share with the other students.Think about it, if you aren't an entitled asshole you wouldn't expect to leave your things there and expect people to treat your shit like its an art exhibit at the museum. Have some fucking decency you fucking entitled assholes, think about others for once. There isn't enough words to express my anger at people who do this shit, but FUCK all of you. And yeah I mean that, FUCK YOU.
TL;DR in nice language. Have courtesy for your fellow students as they pay tuition as well and share common areas such as the library.

Alright, I know it seems really petty to complain about but I feel like this has to be said. Make it into a copy pasta, I don't give a shit. Not sure if admins will even post it cause of language.
Anyway, this is to the people in the UC Berkeley libraries (especially Moffitt) who leave their things in chairs for more than a fucking hour to save their seat. I sit in the library for a very long time and I notice stuff that's literally been left there for fucking hours. When I say multiple hours, I mean I stay at the library for 5-7 hours sometimes and I see shit not moved in that amount of time. You guys have the fucking balls and entitlement to leave your shit there and assume no one will steal your shit. My problem personally, and maybe other people's problem is that people want to sit there too. It is frustrating to walk around the library like an idiot just to find a place to study. Not everyone lives on/near fucking campus and they need a place to stay sometimes and when the library is occupied by someone who isn't even there it's really fucking annoying. They come to the libraries for solace to help them study, but you guys are making the library isolating when all should be welcome. I've opted out to just move their shit. I stopped giving a fuck. You can't hog a fucking seat, we all pay fucking tuition (or at least someone is paying for it). One last thing, don't sit in front of a screen/computer that you aren't using. People need to use it too, and if you do that you are depriving someone that could be using it. You don't own the fucking college, share with the other students.Think about it, if you aren't an entitled asshole you wouldn't expect to leave your things there and expect people to treat your shit like its an art exhibit at the museum. Have some fucking decency you fucking entitled assholes, think about others for once. There isn't enough words to express my anger at people who do this shit, but FUCK all of you. And yeah I mean that, FUCK YOU.

Like she'll reply to emails at midnight every night within 5min of sending her a question and gives us extra supplemental reading and resources without asking. Last week our section did a really shitty job at following some of her requests and this one student decided to go out of their way and make a stupid excuse saying ""the font on your email was too small so I didn't read it so I didn't do the assignment"" and obviously made her feel bad even though she sent out four emails with the same information on it ON TOP of giving us a printed worksheet with the instructions on it the week before. We spent the next three hours doing the worksheet anyways but this person really pissed me off because Helen doesn't deserve any of this shit that we give her and she's such a good person and deserves so much better than us. We're in college stop trying to make jokes and snarky remarks at people who are just trying to help us learn. Grow up dude.

Said he was ruining his life, the lives of the people around him, and my life.
A few days later he killed himself. Granted, there were probably other factors that led to his decision, but I undoubtedly played a role in that. I so badly wished that I had been a better friend and had been more patient instead of just straight up exploding on him. This happened more than 4 years ago in high school.

2237337776542648,"673. So I read two confessions here recently: one was about a girl who thought some guy is in love with her and ""cant live without him"" but the guy has apprently moved on but she still keeps calling him. The other confession is about some guy who had a crush on someone and got rejected & ghosted but he still thinks about her.
The reaction to the first one was like ""oh yeah the guy is so trash"" & ""what an asshole"" & ""you deserve better than this"" & ""he doesnt deserve your love"". The reaction to the second was ""stop following her"" & ""get over it"" & ""make sure you respect her boundaries"" & ""you think too much about her, move on"" .
It appears to me that if girls reject guys and tell them to fuck off, guys have to live with it (which is fair in my view: guys better grow up), but somehow the guys get demonized if they reject girls, as if girls are - by default - entitled to be loved back.
So I tell you this girls: a guy is perfectly entitled to reject your sorry ass and date someone else. Just like you are absolutely entitled to tell some guy to fuck off. It could be that ""he doesnt deserve your love"" but it also could be because (and I hate to point out the obvious) you are ugly as shit or you are just an ass and dont realize it.

2236613819948377,"664. Last year I had a really good friend and we were straight up vibing and it was one of the most enjoyable, pure, laughter-filled friendships I'd ever had. We were like sisters. But when she joined a sorority, things kind of changed a lot. She was obsessed with that sisterhood and all the sisters she liked or looked up to and she wouldn't stop talking about them and how perfect they were. Don't get me wrong. I wasn't jealous or anything and initially even thought it was cool that she found so much joy in her sisterhood. But it got to the point where she was super into it and had to do so much with it, live and breath it. Most conversations were about the next sorority thing or this sister and that sister through the whole sister family tree of grandlittles and grandbigs and bigs and littles. She even introduced me and our mutual friend to one of the sisters she raved about but... that person wasn't remotely cool or unique at all. In any way. Personally, I don't particularly care much at all for the Greek system, nor do I think it serves any solid purpose that could possibly outweigh its massive systemic flaws. But I tried not to make that mindset affect our friendship, and I contained that mindset because I didn't wanna harsh her fun. I even tried to be more open minded by going and supporting her through some of their events. But after a long while, I realized that she'd become so in the system that it estranged us and I couldn't keep faking a fascination with sisters a, b, c from delta cappuccino. More and more, I found I couldn't hang out with her much at all and, not that I intentionally kept turning down hang outs, but it just kind of became that way? I know some of y'all might say that I should've talked to her about this. And I'm not saying I handled the matter perfectly, but I'm not the most outfront communicator and was afraid she'd think I was putting the fault on her, especially as she already was a bit passive aggressive at me once I had stopped hanging out with her as much. I don't think about it a lot now, as I've accepted we've grown apart and that's how it is. But the thought pops up every now and then and it's an odd sort of sadness to have lost that closeness in a friend.","664.

Because I have. But I will never expose that dark side of myself to any psychologist because that would mean getting involved with the authorities, telling my parents about my mental illness; and I fear that it will push me into doing the unthinkable.

A. There’s a boy in my lab section who’s kinda cute and I want to ask for his number but I don’t know how! We haven’t partnered up for anything yet so I can’t really use the “checking answers to calculations” excuse. Any advice?
B. hello, i don't go here but this sucks ass and i request collegiate level boy advice.
i'm a HS senior, and have a college junior friend who i've known for a good four years. over the summer we met up, but what started as conversation over lunch turned into making out in his bed over netflix.
i didn't mind (he's a good fucking kisser and my first, so that's chill) but he flipped out completely after i left for whatever reason (he initiated)
now, i wouldn't be bothered if he just ghosted me, but he instead sinusoidally ricochets between leaving me on read and asking me to sleep over. as ass as it is, i can't forget about it when i don't know what he's feeling and it just keeps him on my mind more.
he's all ""i don't want you to catch feelings, i can't have a romantic relationship rn"" but then pulls this janky shit. is this what FWB looks like? because he asked for that too. seems like it sucks, tbh.
but hey, at least he thinks i'm hot.
also @berkeley, please accept this struggling bitch.
C. wyd when you're in an ldr but you start crushing on someone here . . . send help how do i delete feelings
D. I am pretty sure I’m depressed. I don’t know what it is or how to get rid of it I just can’t do anything, all I do is basically exist right now. I feel like I’m letting everyone around me down by not doing the things that I should be doing, that are expected of me and that I know I’m capable of. That guilt just weighs me down further, but I don’t know what it is, I just can’t find the motivation to do it. Wish there was something that I could do or change asap but I just really don’t know what to do, and in the meantime pretty much just continue to exist. Open to any and all suggestions :)

It's not that I'm never stressed and super successful or do above average on tests (lol I don't). But I feel like Berkeley has given me a chance to reinvent myself. I was actually super depressed in high school but the community of people around me here feels so refreshing. I definitely don't feel like I'm the only one struggling through my personal issues. No one seems afraid to talk about it here, unlike in high school where everyone just seems so outwardly happy and content with their life even though I knew a lot of it was bs. Here I feel like it's ok to feel the way I feel and not be afraid of the things I was so petrified of in high school.
Would my life have been easier if I went to a different college? Maybe... but regardless of what could have been, whenever I face stress/anxiety/depression I just try to remember that moment when I got in to this school. I remind myself of how lucky I am to be here and to have experienced personal growth that I know I wouldn't have elsewhere.","448.

It's been a year and a half since I last seen you in person. But only a few months ago, we were still talking -- mostly arguing about something so minimalistic that I cannot recall. And now, we stopped contacting each other.
Let's start in the beginning.
I met you here at Cal. We spent almost every day together and it felt like we were together. I felt like it... but we were never official. I don't understand how it was possible to text me every single day and invite me to sleep over almost every day yet you were seeing other people.
It broke my heart when I found out you were sleeping with other girls. The worst part of it was that I kept thinking in my head that it's okay because if I loved you and showed that I cared about you, you will learn to love me too. I justified it as since we weren't together officially, then it's fine. He can do what he wants and I had to accept it since he wasn't mine.
Just one random day. As I was hosting a party with my housemates, you texted me and told me we needed to stop seeing each other and stop talking to each other. I was at a party. I was hosting the damn fucking party. I had to leave my own house to cry somewhere else alone. I couldn't find a reason in my head to justify what had happened.
Not even two weeks go by, and you would text me ""Hey, I was wondering how you're doing?"" My dumb ass took it as wow, I have some chance. He cares about me, he thinks of me, and maybe even liked me. Then I thought to myself, wow. Let's try this again. If I showed him that I cared and that I loved him, it will be okay.
But I was wrong. I was SO wrong. You got a long distance girlfriend out of the blue. Maybe you met her when you went home for the holidays or she was here in the bay area on tinder. I don't know. You didn't tell me. I was still texting you every day and I was in love with you. You knew it. You know how I felt and you took full advantage of my love.
Few months ago by, and there were ups and downs in our relationship. And then this happens.
You stopped replying to my messages. When I called, you'll just say you're at work, busy with something or something else. I felt so isolated.
I didn't find out about your girlfriend until she contacted me. She assumed that I am a hoe or some bitch trying to steal her man. I can't blame her. She didn't know I existed and I didn't know she existed.
When I confronted you about it, you lied to her and you let me go. You told me to get out of your life. All I ever did was love you and all I ever wanted was the validation and love back.","413. I still love him. I truly cannot get over him no matter how hard I try.

2214240598852366,"381. I started having hallucinations some time into my Berkeley career. At first I was fucking terrified. I went to a therapist and consulted a neurologist at the advice of my friend. (s/o to that friend for making me go) The hallucinations would happen several times a week and it really disrupted my work flow and made it hard for me to do daily tasks. The fear that I had and the uneasiness of having these hallucinations occur randomly throughout my day just really fucked with me. I had a hard time telling this to my Asian parents because mental health is not really talked about in my family. And honestly when I did I felt relieved that I told them, but it really hurt them a lot and their attitudes just changed. They would call me every night and hearing the hurt in their voices really took a toll on me. Even though my parents are very loving and expressed their concern for me, just seeing them so hurt every day unfortunately didn’t help my mood at all and triggered more hallucinations. I would push them away because I didn’t want to see them hurt but this hurt them more and this cycle of pushing them away just didn’t work out for me so I lied to my therapist and quit seeing professional help and told my parents that I started getting better. I lied to my friend that told me to seek professional help too. I know this isn’t really good, but I’d rather not have the people who I care about the most be sad and worried over my mental health. I still have hallucinations here and there, but honestly they don’t scare me as much as seeing my parents cry. It’s kind of funny how unselfishly selfish this is and everyday feels like I’m living a lie. Makes me wonder if there are others out there like me who put on a good face, but have something slowly eating away at them from the inside.","381.

2214240115519081,"377. so I met this girl a few weeks ago at a friend's party. She was stunning: really smart, beautiful with a killer smile.
We seemed to be hitting it off quite well. We started talking and we only stopped when the party was essentially over.
I did get her number and added her on fb.
But the thing is that ever since that party, she hasent really talked to me. I tried texting her but she takes forever (plus 5hrs) to respond to a text and often times with a single sentece (like I write a paragraph and she responds in 5 words). I suggested going somewhere but she responded that she is busy now and maybe another time. That was a while ago.
The other night, when I was coming back from my lab, I just changed my route to pass by her lab (she did tell me where she does research). Just hoping that maybe we run into each other and I see her smile again. Of course that didnt happen, but the thought itself was intoxicating enough for me to just wonder around the place for some time (it is pathetic, I know).
Now I am wondering if she likes me at all? Maybe on that first day she was just hoping for the party to finish and to get rid of me. Maybe the whole thing was just a mirage. Maybe I was just flattering myself for thinking that she was remotely interested in me.
Basically I dont know whether she is low key telling me to fuck off, or whether she expects me to be more creative and persistant on asking her out or whether she is just really busy (part of me says I should just pick up the phone and ask her exactly that?)
And I need to figure this out without sounding clingy or making a fool of myself. Any suggestions? Should I listen to myself? give it more time? Be more persistent?","377. so I met this girl a few weeks ago at a friend's party. She was stunning: really smart, beautiful with a killer smile.

A. It makes me really uncomfortable that everyone on campus has unilaterally decided Kavanaugh is guilty, end of story.
And let's be totally candid for a second. Everyone knows what he did happens at least a dozen if not a hundred times every single weekend here on frat row.
To anyone who validates this culture by attending their parties, drinking their alcohol, or using their house, keep your high horse self-serving outrage to yourself
To anyone in Greek life who knows the shady things some of your brothers do on weekends, stop pretending their compassion for you excuses them from what they do to others
To anyone who's ever had the audacity to talk about how ""sketch"" [Insert Name] was being the other night, without calling the UCPD because they didn't want to be the person who made a big deal. Shove your self righteousness somewhere else because you're part of the reason Kavanaugh exists, and your wilful ignorance does not excuse your inaction.

B. This won't be posted until the Kavanaugh decision is over, but this is a confession page so whatever.
I had a drinking problem.
And yeah yeah, the saying goes ""it's not alcoholism until you graduate"" but let's face it, binge drinking is a problem. It's a problem when I can't recall parts of the night on many nights. It's a problem when I feel like I can only socialize when I have alcohol in me. It's a problem when I try to forget all about my life and feel popular by drinking myself to death every weekend.
It's a problem when I made unwanted sexual advances on girls when I was drunk.
This is in the past, and I have since learned to control myself for a variety of reasons, but I know drinking is not an excuse for these actions, and I still feel guilty for it now. Drunk me is not off the hook for being belligerent, or predatory, or being an asshole.
Being able to step further away from it now I've learned that drinking culture has just accepted these behaviors as normal and it's honestly really disgusting. Whatever people say about ""I don't know anyone who hasn't gotten into a bar fight"" or ""I *only* had one beer"" or defends their own blacking out with ""have YOU"" just normalize the idea that you need to drink until all human decency is thrown out the window.
C. The Ford/Kavanaugh hearings have really been fucking with me. A lot of my friends have been sexually assaulted or harassed or stalked or made to feel unsafe because someone didn't respect them as human beings. I watched the shit they went through afterwards and are still going through now, the way they tense up in crowds, how they jump at every noise when they're walking home at night. Their attackers went home after doing it and are living a full life that they have no right to. Because my friends thought there wasn't enough evidence, or because they had been drinking that night, or because they didn't want their families to find out. It feels like nothing can stop it from happening over and over again, like the people who hurt people that I care about won't ever pay for what they've done.
D. Judge Kavanaugh got the seat. My roommate and I shared a congratulatory drink even though she’s a democrat. It’s cool we can agree to disagree and come to an understanding. I hope the campus atmosphere becomes more and more like this.
E. I think it was a good thing Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed. Why? Because sexual assault is sexual assault, rape is rape, and drunk sex at parties is drunk sex at parties. If both a man and a woman are drunk, to the same level of intoxication, the man is not any more responsible than the woman. Brett didn't abuse his power in the workplace like the men who got busted in metoo did. Brett is just a college frat boy douche. He isn't locking people in his office and threatening them with ruining their career","359. (Kavanaugh Compilation)
A. It makes me really uncomfortable that everyone on campus has unilaterally decided Kavanaugh is guilty, end of story.
And let's be totally candid for a second. Everyone knows what he did happens at least a dozen if not a hundred times every single weekend here on frat row.

Frequently Asked Questions:
Q. How long does it take for a confession to be posted?
A. It depends, but at the time of this writing the page has about a 2 week delay.
Q. How is there a back-and-forth between two confessions posted in one day, when supposedly there is a two week delay between submission and posting?
A. The admins of this page check the submissions often, and sometimes elect to add in extra posts or bump them ahead in the schedule if it is timely to do so.
Q. Do admins decide what to publish?
A. Yes, we filter somewhat for quality.
Q. Why didn't you post my confession?
A. It was probably either very generic, a negative thing about a named person (only wholesome things about named people are allowed), egregiously discriminatory, or just hasn't been posted yet.
Q. Can admins see who submitted confessions?
A. No. Although we sometimes wish we could.","Submission link: tinyurl.com/ucbconfessions

I even caught him still on Tinder, and the truth is I'm scared. I'm scared because this is the best thing I've had in a while or at least it seems like that. I want to work out our problems. Thanks for all confirming I'm a terrible person; I already know that, but I really don't know what I should do.

First I met her for boba near market street in SF, and i offered to pay but then she absolutely refused and paid with a $100 bill! Then we chatted and walked around union square. When it came time for dinner, I suggested going to this Korean place, but she said 太便宜了, which means too cheap in English.
So we ended up going to this place called Cala. She ordered like the fanciest dish on the menu, abalone and trout caviar avocado toast. $26 for an appetizer, Holy shit. This time I had to fight with her to actually get to split the bill with me. Lastly, we met up with 2 of her girlfriends and went to the temple night club. She got freaking Hennessy magnum bottle service!!! $750 a bottle. It was a fun time and I tried to pay my share of it but her friends insist they got it covered. Now that was a night.","309.

2210993662510393,"294. So many students at Berkeley are insecure and addicted to exclusiveness. Having served on boards for multiple clubs, I've literally seen people get denied from clubs over the pettiest or smallest reasons just because the president and VP want to ""be selective"". No impressive resume? Kiss your chances of getting accepted to a club as a freshman goodbye for a huge deal of clubs. Guess what, not everyone comes into Berkeley with tons of internships and club leadership positions. Not everyone is from Troy, Diamond Bar, Homestead, Lynbrook, Monte Vista, or any of those other high schools most students here seem to be from where the amount of clubs and opportunities students have are actually ridiculous.
My high school had three big clubs: Key Club, CSF, and NHS. There were maybe like 2 or 3 smaller ones that did not do much. I'm lucky as shit I had leadership in all three and a summer internship which was already a miracle since my hometown did not really have places that give students internships. I know others at Berkeley who were not so lucky. Berkeley likes to pride itself in economic mobility and stuff, but just getting accepted here is not enough if you can't take advantage of a lot of orgs just because you don't stack up to people who went to gunner high schools and still got rejected from Ivies and Stanford.
I will admit, I have looked into students' backgrounds when reading resumes from club apps and have given advantages to students from clearly disadvantaged backgrounds (underrepresented minority, bad high school, etc). In fact, I have actually pushed for applicants who went to places like Troy and Diamond Bar and Lynbrook to not get an interview for the orgs I was an officer for. Once I can actually get the disadvantaged students an interview, they always seem to have much more passion to offer, and when they are accepted they contribute so much, whereas the latter group looks good on paper but screams of insecurity once they are in and usually end up not being too interested, because for them it is just another resume booster, but for the former, it was the real boost they needed. If someone hadn't been looking out for me in the same way before, I would've never had these amazing leadership opportunities. I would've never won scholarships to study and intern abroad. I would've never landed a prestigious internship at an Embassy this past summer. I urge all clubs to actually try to grant interviews to people based on shit more than just a resume and a couple small ass prompts that no one actually cares about or remembers after two seconds of reading it.","294.

But then I started dropping by his office hours to chat. Although our conversations were mostly about class and grad school, his personality and how sophisticated he is sort of made me like him more. I remember the first time I read one of his works. I was so turned on by how articulate he is and how well he writes.
Fast-forward to about a year later. I’m not his student anymore. We still run into each other every now and then. Sometimes he’s the one who takes notice and calls my name when I’m not looking. I know that doesn’t really mean anything, but it makes me feel warm and flushed.
I really want to ask him out for a cup of coffee, but I’m at a vulnerable point in my life at the moment. It’s hard for me to take rejection because of the current state of my mental health, especially if the rejection comes from someone I admire and look up to. But I also know that, even in the off-chance that he’s attracted to me, he probably won’t make the first move because of the student-instructor relationship that we had and the power dynamics that come with it.
I used to think having a puppy crush on your GSI was sort of sexy because of the taboo element. But when you’re genuinely drawn to the person beyond those kind eyes and that scruffy face and soothing smile... It kinda sucks.","288. I had a crush on my GSI last year.

I know where you're coming from and though I did not feel that way immediately upon graduation, I did feel that way after leaving my first job to my second job (before graduate school). Personally, the first year after graduating felt better than even when I was in undergrad, which I didn't think would be possible. Some tips that might help:
- Join Meetup and actually go to the events. Depending on where you are, Meetup is a great way to find like-minded people and to pursue hobbies that you enjoyed.
- Join a group exercise class or set a fitness-related goal. For me, I was so out of shape in undergrad that when I graduated I deliberately signed up for things like dance classes and marathons to kick my butt into shape. I would set an hour aside every day or two (even if it had to be at 6 AM or midnight) to either attend classes or get ready for the marathons or dance competitions I was in. This also helped to find a social group, but more importantly staying physically fit and creating a routine was key to getting the endorphins going and having a sense of fulfillment as I saw my physical shape slowly but consistently improve.
- Write to and meet up with at least one alumnus every day, or go to networking events and commit yourself to following up with at least one person you find interesting there. I was in a non-profit job after graduation that was low-paying, with high work hours, and was highly frowned upon by my immigrant parents as being an idealistic, no-future career. I enjoyed it but felt that I needed to try something else to justify my ""elite"" education. Then I joined the FinTech sphere. I was literally making 3x what I used to make, with fewer work hours, more vacation time, and prestige for working for a large firm, but I felt miserable both because the day-to-day work did not fit my personality and because it lacked a sense of fulfillment I desired. I networked and found two other jobs, though ultimately ended up returning to graduate school. While in my first job, however, I was also networking to see what career paths were available to me, and realized that the world is so much more flexible to multiple career paths than I ever imagined, and people job-hopped pretty consistently. It is important to find what you enjoy and what you're good at, and your work in your early years is such a big part of your life that you should find it on the whole (we all have down days) at least somewhat fun, interesting and/or fulfilling. Talking to people helps you see what else is out there, serves as inspiration to see that you can make the switch too, and either directly or indirectly creates the opportunities, connections, and information necessary to jump ship and start a new role elsewhere or on your own when conditions allow.
-Realize that life changes and that's OK. The world and career paths are less clear-cut than in the university, and friend groups are more transient as people move. You also realize that it's harder to ""save the world"" or become a billionaire/entrepreneur/influencer/whatever than school made it out to be. That's OK. Embrace the freedom of being able to find new friend groups, redefining what's important for you, tapping into and collaborating with like-minded people in a niche field, and realizing that even if you don't see your friends every day, you can still maintain close ties with a simple phone or Skype call every one or two months. If your case is like mine, a lot of friends I had in college I haven't talked to again, but 4 or 5 remain that, when I see them for the first time in 6 months or a year, it's almost as if nothing's changed. More so, now I stay in touch, collaborate, and even enjoy friendships with former work colleagues and bosses, which is a more fulfilling relationship in its own way. Along with that, don't be afraid of making friends younger than or older than you. Some of my most fulfilling relationships are with mentors ten years my senior.
Best of luck and hope this helps at least a bit! We've all been there, and everything improves with time!","66. Grad student and Class of 2014 East coast uni transplant @ #48 (Class of 2016 poster):
