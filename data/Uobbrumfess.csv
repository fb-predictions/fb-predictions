I have a question for gamers.
How much does your opinion of a game depend on graphics? This is obviously coming after the Halo infinite trailer and it's brute meme. Can a game with very mediocre graphics but an amazing expansive story be enough for the game to be amazing? Not saying Halo infinite will have this but we can hope. I'm still very excited for the game but just wanted others opinions that aren't just Twitter trolls.

TW: sexual assault, rape
Weighing in on the sexual assault convo...
When I was in first year, I got with a friend of a friend on a night out. We ended up sleeping together which was all well and good (and CONSENSUAL!!!!). Fast forward to the morning and I’m asleep, but I’m woken up by him having sex with me again. I was asleep. I couldn’t consent. I was raped in my own bed because a guy thought it was okay to have sex with a girl while she was sleeping.
Don’t tell me that consent and rape aren’t an issue - just because I consented once doesn’t mean that I would or even could consent again. Maybe instead of attacking women for making assault allegations, listen to them instead and maybe (WILD IDEA I KNOW) like LISTEN to them?

Brumfess 'regulars': you do not need to have an opinion about everything. If you don't know about a subject or issue, keep schtum rather than giving out bad advice. I've seen so many factually inaccurate or downright damaging advice coming from you. Don't perpetuate the culture of weighing in just to have an opinion. Think before you try to 'help'. And no, I'm not a hater or whatever, never even made a brumfess before, I'm just worried because you're giving people completely illegitimate advice.

Most doctors did not get the pay rise that was recently announced either. Just like nurses, junior doctors, who make up 80% of hospital doctors, had an “agreed” 3 year pay rise in 2018 of 2% (which is below inflation & lower than the 4% nurses have received, which is criminal in itself btw) so were exempt too. This was the contract imposed on them following the 2016 strikes. GPs who make up over half of all doctors, were exempt as well because they are not directly salaried from the government.
So the only doctors - hospital consultants - who make up a minority of less than 20% are to receive the 2.8% extra announced by Boris. That equates to somewhere between £14-24 extra per week. And this is the first pay rise consultants have received in the last 12 years.
Over the last 10 years junior doctors have seen their salaries reduced by 1/3. So much for clapping and “thanking” the NHS.

Hey baby witch! I don't feel comfy posting a comment but i just want to let you know to avoid using white sage, palo Santo and calling smoke cleansing 'smudging'. White sage and smudging are specific to certain californian native american tribes, and white sage is commodified and commercialised to the point of being over harvested. Smudging is an extremely specific and spiritual ritual to these tribes too, which is why smoke cleansing is a more appropriate word! Beauty Independent has a decent article on it to give an overview.
Other types of sage are fine but I'd highly advise against using white sage. Good luck on your journey!

I'm a bisexual woman in a straight-seeming relationship with a man, and I'd like to share some experiences of biphobia I've faced from friends from the LGBT+ community.
I've been constantly referred to as straight, to my face.
I've also been referred to as 'that boring straight couple'. Now I can take being called straight by friends or strangers who don't know, but from people who are some of my friends and who I've had multiple conversations about my sexuality with? Come on. And the 'boring' just hurts, please never call your friends boring.
I've been told there's no place for me at pride and I shouldn't go.
I've been asked, multiple times, if I regret getting into a serious relationship so young (22), yet I have gay friends in openly gay relationships who are called 'couple goals'.
I've been asked 'not to be so straight' when kissing my partner on the cheek or holding his hand at a party, when there's people fully making out in the corner.
I've been told to 'dress more gay' if I want people to call me bi, like idk what even is that?
These are just a few examples, all from friends in the LGBT+ community. I've never (yet) faced any biphobia from my straight friends, at least to my face.
I fully understand my straight-seeming privilege I face from my relationship, and all the benefits I face in society. but biphobia is such a huge thing in the LGBT+ community, and many people don't want to acknowledge it or accept it, but it's real folks.

TW: depression
I don't often post on Brumfess, but I desperately need to say these things and I don't want anyone in my life to know. I'm so confused about my mental health. Some days I genuinely think I'm depressed, but some days I'm absolutely fine and then hate myself for ever thinking I wasn't, and I just feel wrong for having thought that about myself when others are genuinely struggling every day. Lockdown has got to me, badly, and on more than one occassion I've found myself googling things like 'most painless ways to kill myself' with the slight hope my parents might see my internet history, as a cry for help. I don't think I'd ever really do it, I'm just not... happy? but then sometimes I really am? And then I feel guilty? I'm really confused and have recently caught myself often thinking that ending things would just be better, and I sort of wish I just had the courage to actually do it. In the last year or so I've done some things that I really regret, and I've hurt some people that I was really close to to the point where they're not a part of my life any more, so I know that however truly sorry I am that I am not a good person, and I can't forgive myself. I'm just fed up of being me and feeling so conflicted and hating myself. It's easy to say 'talk to someone' but I'm just so ashamed of it all that I can't ever see myself doing that, even to someone I'm close to. I want a do-over, and I can't really picture a future for myself anyway. I don't know what to do.

The ways in which you’ve seen biphobia are probably more linked to fetishisation. Most men are accepting of lesbians even if they aren’t of gay men, because they see wlw as entertainment and unthreatening to their manhood. To a confident man, if they see a bisexual woman as promiscuous, it isn’t threatening but exciting. At the same time, the idea that bisexuality is inherently linked to promiscuity is biphobic so although they might not seem to have an issue with it, they are biphobic.
I think in some cases biphobia is linked to homophobia when it comes to women not wanting to date men, it’s the idea that a man attracted to a man makes him less masculine and therefore less attractive but I can’t pretend to fully understand where any of this comes from, just guess from my observations.

Okay, to all the cowardly biphobic people hiding behind brumfess I just want to say that you're all either:
- really ignorant and uneducated
- assholes
- both the above
Lucky for those in the first category, there's plenty of reading online as well as resources such as YouTube channels (check out Jessie Paige) and the University LGBTQ+ society where you can educate yourselves!
Now for the rest of you, keep your biphobia and nastiness to yourselves please! Literally NOBODY wants to read about it. It's vile, hateful and honestly really petty. You don't wanna date us bi people? Great, we don't want to date YOU either!!
Finally, just want to say to every bisexual out there getting triggered and upset by this biphobia...You are valid, you are beautiful and you are awesome! Whilst it's unfortunate our university has some horrible people, remember that there are loads of nice, accepting people too!
Loads of people who won't judge you or treat you differently for who you're attracted to, and that the rest of the bi community has your back ;) xx

Finally, just want to say to every bisexual out there getting triggered and upset by this biphobia...You are valid, you are beautiful and you are awesome! Whilst it's unfortunate our university has some horrible people, remember that there are loads of nice, accepting people too!
Loads of people who won't judge you or treat you differently for who you're attracted to, and that the rest of the bi community has your back ;) xx

Hey does anyone here play Apex Legends on PS4?
Wanna grind ranked but if you've played it you know how crazy it is playing with randoms.
About me: scraping by on gold rank every season I actually try
Not gonna talk much other than for game related stuff so I might be a bit of a cold convo partner if that's what you look for in a squad mate 😂
Like this and I might message you

I'm a bi woman and I want to ask people who wouldn't date someone who's bi: why? Like I am genuinely confused as to why me liking more than one gender makes me less worthy of dating than someone else. I'm assuming it's due to the stereotype that we cheat or something like that but how does my sexuality affect how monogamous I am? How does me having a bigger pool of people I can be potentially attracted to affect how I'd act in a relationship? Feel free to reply anonymously with your reasoning because I don't understand.
Also does biphobia come from straight people or others in the LGBT community? Bc I feel like my bisexuality has never affected my relationships with men so I'm wondering if it's mostly the LGBT community holding these views?

My first week on sertraline was horrific, but some of this might have anticipation about symptoms. After I took it I was exhausted and couldn’t stop yawning for the first day, then second day I had pretty bad diarrhoea and my mood suddenly dropped and I felt very low. I barely ate for a week because I felt nauseous and lost my appetite, but at the same time I was really hungry and had really bad heartburn/indigestion symptoms. Think I might’ve woken up in the night with chest pain too. So overall my first week was horrific, but on about day 6 my symptoms stopped very suddenly and I don’t remember having symptoms when I went up a dose (started on 25mg then up to 50 after a week). I was pretty hyper as well for the first few weeks(which I mistook for it working). I stayed on it 6 months and went up to 150mg, which made my really suicidal so I had to come off it (which had some side effects like brain shocks) and start a new medication. Overall it improved my anxiety slightly but made my depression worse.
Obviously everyone’s experience is different and sertraline works wonders for a lot of people. My advice would be to give it time to work but make sure you’re fully honest with yourself about how much it’s working. My mistake was second guessing myself and feeling guilty about it not working, and therefore staying on it too long. With most antidepressants side effects are pretty mild/non existent once you’ve settled on it but if the side effects are bad then speak to your doctor.

I wrote #Brumfess40141 . I didn't think I would have to post again but here I am, just over two weeks later.
As a Jew, I am devastated.
I'm sure many of you are aware of the sickening antisemitic rant Wiley, a British grime artist, went on on Twitter and Instagram. For those of you who are unaware, I urge you to look it up.
Among his other comments, Wiley has claimed that Jews fund the KKK, stated that Jews make him sick and that they should ""hold corn"" (after looking this phrase up I found out that this means to ""recieve bullets"" - i.e. to be shot). He has been aggressive towards Jews in his rant. He has used the phrase ""Jewish Privilege"" to threaten Jews and to further his antisemitic agenda. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. I can't list everything he has said as it would take too long, but after reading it all I feel sick. The comments on his posts are littered with sympathy and support for his revolting and vile words. He has made no attempt at an apology, nor is he likely to. He has no remorse and even seems to be proud to despise Jews. He is an antisemite. And yet the ""punishment"" he has recieved is nothing short of a slap on the wrist - his twitter account was disabled for 12 hours (most of this over night) and nothing has happened to his Instagram account.
This is not the only antisemitism I have seen surface over the last few weeks. The hashtag ""Jewish Privilege"" was trending not too long ago. This hashtag has been used as a tool to spread antisemitic conspiracies and hate speech. I am an Ashkenazi Jew and I benefit from the privilege that the colour of my skin gives me. But to claim that my Judaism gives me privilege is truly baffling to me, especially given the amount of abuse I have received throughout my life BECAUSE of my religion (and this can be said for so many other Jews that I know).
And just look at Nick Cannon's antisemitic comments, and the lack of action taken against him.
And, yet again, the world is silent.
If you are willing to post about racism but actively choose to ignore antisemitism, you are a hypocrite.
Once again I ask you to consider if the situation were reversed. If it were a Jew with a public platform going on a racist rant about people of colour there would rightly be outrage. They would be called out as a racist. It would be all over my feed. But as soon as it is antisemitism, there is radio silence. This is a double standard in which one form of racism is unnaceptable and deserving of punishment and outrage, but another is brushed over and only ever given a slap on the wrist. This double standard is unacceptable.
People wonder why Jews don't feel safe in the UK. This is why. Maybe you should re-evaluate yourself - you might be part of the problem as well.
Once again, your silence is deafening. Your lack of action speaks volumes. We recognise your hypocracy. We see you.
Do better.
Side note:
My ""Jewish Privilege"" is being being called a ""dirty f*cking Jew"" at the age of 11 for wearing a Star of David necklace. This is one of countless incidents.

I am Jewish and I’m not very religious though I’m interested in getting back into the faith. I want to say that I am first and foremost British, and I’m really upset that people see us as less-than. Even back with the whole Corbin spiel the faults of the Israeli government were being attributed to the Jewish community and used as a scapegoat for antisemitism. Antisemitism is still very real and very prevalent. It makes me fear putting ‘Jewish’ when I make profiles eg when registering with the uni each year etc. I don’t want to hide or deny my heritage, and I love my grandparents who taught me what it means to be a loving and compassionate Jewish person, but I worry that I will be judged for something I cannot control.

I genuinely want to know why there are straight people who wouldn’t date bisexual people. I’m not trying to antagonise anyone, but as someone bi, and having everyone assume I’m straight this is the stuff that terrifies me from coming out because I have no idea where this hate is coming from and then people hide it under the guise of it being a preference.
I can only explain what it’s like to be Bi: being Bi isn’t 50-50 liking men and women. It’s different for every bi person what their ratios are. It has nothing to do with wanting everyone or increasing the quantity of who someone can be with. I’m bi because when I like someone I fall in love with who they are as a person and as an entity, gender doesn’t define that for me that’s literally it.
But from straight people, I want to know why it bothers you. Because if that person is a monogamist, then them liking 2+ genders shouldn’t vex you because it doesn’t multiply the chances of them cheating on you. If someone cheats on you it’s not because of their sexuality it’s because of them as an individual. And even if they aren’t a monogamist, being polyamorist isn’t exclusive to bi people many straight people are. Being monogamist or poly is not based on sexuality.
And if you’re spooked by the fact that they have had different sexual experiences, so has every individual you have ever met. No one should enforce sexual desires that you don’t want to fulfil, and yes there are awful people that do that but it’s not because of their sexuality it’s because of them as an individual.
I personally don’t see how it can be just be a preference to not date someone bi just because they’re bi? The way I see it, it’s discriminatory because there isn’t anything different about our character just based on our sexuality.
If you feel differently I’m not antagonising you, I want to understand where you’re coming from, because the only reasons people have given me are prejudicial stereotypes that aren’t true. And saying stuff is just a preference only works when you can’t control initial attraction or you can’t feel chemistry. There is no way you can confirm if someone is bi unless that person tells you, so if you’re interested and then all of a sudden them being bi is what bothers you, why and where is it coming from?

Ok so i am confused doctor basically said im going to end up with a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder.
Ive been lashing out, aggressively verbally not physically. Having black outs probably due to hugh alcohol consumption. Ive not been able to control my emotions and often go from 0-100 and think certain people in my house are always against me and get a kick out of making me feel suspicious paranoid etc.
equally i think i cant blame my mental health for lashing out verbally at my partner. So much so he’s left my house in the middle of the night and sat on the bench outisde aldi just to get away from me.
But I want to be able to control this. As pretty soon im going to be left with no one. Ive told my doctor i dont think forward thinking birmingham will intervene until I have no one and nothing.
My question is: how much of my behaviour is caused by my mental health? I think it’s poor to use mental health as an excuse for being an awful
Person as ive described. But why else would i d9 this? Will I ever be able to form a relationship with someone who wants to put up with this?

I totally get the argument of anxiety causing some people to hold back in seminars. Let me tell you, I get hella socially anxious, especially talking in front of lots of people who I don’t know (history student, big classes, barely see the same faces again). I just used to think whatever I may say will be totally wrong and I’ll look like an idiot, like my opinions were dumb and not contributing anything of value to the seminar. HOWEVER, some of my tutors/classes were so good, really encouraging debate between us in a relaxed atmosphere (rather than forcing you on the spot which only causes more anxiety) that it made me feel able to openly talk. And since contributing more to my classes, I feel I learn so SO much more. Rather than copying down everyone else’s notes, actually getting involved made me understand the things were learning about so much better. I also think it helps picking modules that you genuinely find really interesting and feel passionate about. If you don’t really care about the topic, you might not complete or fully understand the readings, and you’ll have nothing to say - whereas if you enjoy it and WANT to learn it’s a different story. If you CAN try to contribute more, please push yourself out of the comfort zone. You will not regret it :) x

Look if you refuse to date someone purely because they are bisexual, you are being biphobic. Literally by DEFINITION! It changes nothing about the person and you should have a long hard think about why you actually don’t want to date a bi person. Think they’re more likely to cheat? WRONG.

At the start of lockdown I was bored so I decided to do what any other self-respecting 20 year old would do and set up an account on Club Penguin. The nostalgia drew me in and I began to play for hours on end every single day, ignoring messages from my real friends. Anyway, as time went on I joined groups to collect stamps and whatnot and met this really cool penguin who claimed to be a 19 year old girl. We would play mini games together and go to each others igloos to just talk about life. One thing led to another and she became my club penguin girlfriend. We would genuinely spend hours talking to each other but never once exchanged contacts or social media. Recently, I logged onto Club Penguin but I haven't seen my Club penguin girlfriend in ages. I'm actually becoming really sad at the prospect of never talking to her again, but more importantly I think I've fallen hard for her. I don't know what she looks like but her penguin is beautiful. I have fallen in love with a cartoon penguin. How do I get over a virtual penguin I've never met? :(

Last night I went to the pub with my friends and she was constantly messaging me asking me why I won’t meet up with her and I eventually removed her off sc (that’s where she was messaging me) so that I could enjoy my night with my friends. She then spent the whole night ringing me, even though she knew I was with my friends, and trying to paint me out to be the villain even though I broke up with her cause she was kinda psycho.
Am I actually the villain here?

Ok I’m not going to lie and pretend I hate Taylor swift or haven’t listened to all of folklore but there’s plenty of valid reasons why people hate here e.g. Having predonimantly black people behind her in the shake it off video when she’s got the hoop earring outfit and is kind of looking chavvy, wildest dreams where she plays a colonialist in Africa, sensationalising it was also a questionable choice. She hasn’t really ever fully addressed her privilege from generational wealth. Her activism isn’t really activism, the height of her support for black matters was her requesting statues be removed in Tennessee. She can do better and she needs to do better on big issues if she’s going to do a whole documentary on how she’s ready to speak about politics and then she’s just fallen short of it all. Not to mention that the VMA move which brought her to fame may have been because Kanye is a dick, but it gained sooo much traction because he’s a black man and she’s a white woman: she then preached at Kanye in a biting sarcastic song when literally a tiny bit of empathy could have said otherwise, not to mention he was probably right, Beyoncé did deserve that award. Anyway there are many, many reasons why people don’t like Taylor swift and people acting as if it’s just misogyny are wrong.

The support for the BLM movement has shown the tolerance and action of kind people with regards to attacks on minorities. But as a Jew this is the first time in my life I feel scared for myself based on my race.
Wiley continues his nearly three day tirade advocating for figures and conspiracies that were founded by Nazi Germany and weaponised by white supremacists today to justify anti-Semitism violence.
Being against Israel is fine, it's your opinion, but please don't mistake standing up for the Jewish community as endorsing Israel or demonising Palestine.
This isn't complicated or political. I'm a Jew, and I'm scared.
Please show the same attention and hatred for anti-Semitism as we have done for racism of all kind.

I’ve learnt about all types of disabilities, learnt a bit of sign language from deaf content makers, I’ve learnt about amputees, Tourette’s, autism, even things I’ve never heard of. I’ve been inspired by the likes of Flo and her healthy attitude towards losing weight. I appreciate it’s given a voice to sex workers who are often marginalised. There’s obviously still nasty commenters and trolls but overall I’d say it’s so inclusive and I’m living for it!

When i was younger i had very curly hair, but over the years ive kind of brushed it/blowdried it straight. It's never been totally straight though, always a bit unruly. I read that this means I might have a wave/curl pattern trying to shine through so I tried the curly girl method (only using Aussie's miracle moist conditioner) and there's definitely waves and some almost-curls trying to be seen. But what do I do now?? How should I encourage them? What products should I get? Anyone been through a similar thing? (for context I have fairly dry, shoulder length, medium thickness European hair)

Hi, just wondering whether anyone on the Contraceptive Implant is willing to share their experiences. I’ve got heavy periods, cramps, and quite bad acne, how likely is it that the implant will worsen/alleviate these? I like that it’s long lasting and can be quickly removed if there are bad side effects without lingering hormones causing prolonged trouble, but I’m worried about heavier periods and even worse skin, things that already drive me mad!

Not dating someone because they're bi doesn't necessarily make you biphobic. Just as having a racial preference doesn't make you racist. You have preferences in terms of appearance which you can't explain. For example if I like blondes it doesn't mean I have something inherently against brunettes.

I think it’s interesting how people are so cautious as to not step on the toes of Muslims and Jews but when it come to Christians people don’t care. It’s seems like they go out of their way even to offend them or disrespect their faith. You don’t have to agree, but the least for can do is be respectful of their beliefs.

I personally haven’t heard the term ‘bisexual lesbian, so can’t actually comment on it myself (though I do empathise with OPs confusion) but I want to know why you say they are transphobic. I genuinely can’t work out why

TW: sexual assault
I want to address the Brumfess that was posted last week or whenever it was that was saying ""You can't say m*n are trash because I would personally stand up for a woman being sexually harassed!!!1"" The reality is that when me and my fellow women have experienced this no man spoke up or did anything. When I was 15 I went to a house party. I was drunk but still aware of everything, just a bit wobbly and stuff. I sat down on the grass to chill and this guy in my class came over and sat next to me. At first I thought he was just being friendly but then he started getting sexual by groping my breasts and trying to grab my butt (he couldn't as he was sitting down). He also tried to kiss me on the lips a few times. I kept saying ""No"" but he didn't go away until I literally exploded at him and kept telling him to fuck off. There must have been 40 people around us, most of them probably guys and did anyone do anything? No.
When we went back to school on Monday guys from his friend group (and it was only guys doing it) were laughing and snickering at me in class referencing how the guy had ""raped"" me (he hadn't, only assaulted). Apparently he had a reputation for being a creep to girls at house parties so obviously they knew he was a creep and were just letting him get away with it. I didn't know this prior to the party btw.
To be honest that was the worst part of the experience. I'm over the assault itself because I'm glad I stood up for myself and got him to fuck off but men's reaction to my experience was so much worse and it still makes me feel shit to this day. Obviously the harasser had gone back to his friend group and bragged about how he violated me and instead of saying to him ""Hey maybe you shouldn't grope non-consenting girls"" they just rubbed it in my face. So next time you get offended at us saying m*n are trash because you think you would do something in these situations, direct your energy at your male peers who do this shit to us. Our society would have flying cars and time travel by now if men stopped getting offended at ""m*n are trash"" and actually held their male friends who harass women accountable.

I see soooo many posts about shitty landlords and letting agents. If you still need somewhere for September, you might want to consider applying to the Birmingham Student Housing Co-operative. As it's a co-op, they manage the house themselves, do their own maintenance and run their own finances, and there is no exploitative landlord to worry about. It requires a bit of extra work but you can do stuff you can't normally do like decorate rooms however you want. Plus they have a massive garden and a trampoline. Their page is https://www.facebook.com/BirminghamStudentHousingCoop

I am 21 but I look really young, like people guess my age between 16 and 18 regularly. I have quite a young face, but also quite a child like body- I am 5""1 and no real curves. I had my first proper boyfriend when I was 18 (first year) and he was 22 (in his final year). I also was also a virgin. The relationship was really toxic for a lot of reasons and we broke up after around 9 months. I never realised it at the time but he was also just really obsessed with the fact I was young and looked even younger. When I told him I was a virgin he said that he loved the idea of taking my virginity because it would mean I was his. His friends would regularly call him a shark and things like that too. He wouldn’t let me have my independence, like I had to see him everyday I couldn’t go on a night out without him etc. He would regularly call me baby and asked me to call him daddy in bed. My fashion was always pretty basic, but I would dress up for special occasions, he used to say he didn’t like how much more mature I looked when I wore tight clothing or make up. He would always just go on about how young and innocent I was, and how he had ‘taken’ my innocence. It was just really fucked up and I didn’t realise it at the time. I looked him up a few weeks ago and he’s now 25, and dating another girl who looks really really young, it just makes me feel so uncomfortable that he exists and gets away with it, like having a fetish for taking someone’s virginity or dating young girls is not normal? And just because 16 is the legal age of consent doesn’t mean that you should be fucking 16 year olds? Just because it’s ‘legal’ doesn’t mean it’s moral, and preying on young girls is fucked up. I swear if they changed the age of consent to 12 some men would then try and date 12 year olds. It’s all kinds of fucked up and fetishising young girls and preying on freshers has so many layers linked with paedophilia. It’s fucked up.

I actually see what u mean. You can’t help what ur attracted to, finding out someone you’re initially attracted to is bisexual is a part of who they are. If you didn’t realise this before, it’s understandable that it could change the way you look at them? Sexuality is a big part of your identity and yeah you should be with someone who accepts it, but at the same time if someone doesn’t then that’s also their choice? No one is saying ur not allowed to be bi or they they hate u!! They’re just saying they don’t wanna date you personally

does anyone other than the ""brumfess regulars"" enjoy the input and commenting of ""brumfess regulars"". i personally believe they are very negative for the platform and lead to the demise of it's wider use as pwople lose interest in seeing the opinions of the same few people. not a criticism of them as people, but it's an odd choice to monopolise a platform in an attempt to be popular? well known?

My previous boyfriend cheated on me when he moved to university and my life became miserable. He was a horrible person who made my mental health decline to the worst level it’s ever been. I’m now in a relationship with someone and I’m incredibly happy but long distance through Covid and then through uni again at the end of September is scaring me. I want to trust him and know that my trust problems are my own issue but I don’t know how to deal with long distance for the next few years. Any advice? I don’t want to end the relationship but would it be better in the long run to not get hurt again?

I grew up listening to Wileys music, but after reading his last tweets about jewish people I must say I am extremely disappointed hurt, and upset. This comes 2 weeks after the shein swastika fiasco (which was actually being defended by some people?!), and after the trending jewish privilege hashtag on twitter. Why is no one talking about this? I have supported BLM from the beginning, going to local protests despite my dad being very ill in hospital with the virus. I don’t see the same amount of outcry about this. As a Jewish person, I don’t feel safe in my own country. I can’t display signs of my religion out of fear I’ll hear something along the lines of ‘dirty jew’ which I did hear in PRIMARY SCHOOL. Everytine Israel is mentioned on a public forum it is met with horrible and nasty responses which, in my opinion anyway, is a coverup for anti Semitic beliefs. To the People who are defending the swastika: I get that the swastika is a religious symbol for Hindus, but unfortunately it has been resymbolised as hatred. I don’t understand how you think this is okay to outwardly wear a sign that was responsible for 6 million deaths. Your jewish friends can see you posting about every social matter except anti semitism. We are learning that our friends no longer have our back. Like black lives matter, to be silent about anti semitism is to perpetrate anti semitism.
Let’s all treat each other with respect and decency. Stop listening to Wileys music and supporting individuals who are willing to post some nasty things about a religion. You wouldn’t support somebody who posted those things about black people. Time to re evaluate who we give our support to.

hi ! i've been on sertraline for about 5 months now, starting at 50mg before bumping to 100mg then 150mg. for me, it's not really been working so i'm being changed onto citalopram next week. some antidepressants (and certain doses) work for some people and not others.. it's about trying different types and different doses with your gp until one ends up helping. i just want to say that while the sertraline hasn't been helpful for me, i had a course of cbt a couple of months ago and found that really beneficial at the time. if you can get in contact with somewhere like forward thinking birmingham it might be worth looking into non- medical means of helping yourself too, especially if you talk about it with your gp and they think it could be of use to you
i hope you get the help you need, op <3

I have depression and anxiety and find it really really hard to leave the house. I've had panic attacks over going to the shop before, and spend most days entirely inside unless I absolutely have to get some food or something (this was the same before Covid too, so it's not just virus fear/lockdown). I do think the pandemic made my anxiety around going outside worse, especially now things are opening up and it feels ""wrong"" to me to go do stuff because the virus is still spreading, but I've been thinking about how little I left the house even before and how just thinking about walking down a street would make my heart rate increase. Any tips for making this easier?

I have debated posting this for a while but in light of recent discussions here goes.
As a gay woman I'd like to take the time say:
EVERYONE HAS PREFERENCES WHEN IT COMES TO DATING!!!
You're not transphobic for not wanting to date a trans woman, guess what, i like my women like I like my coffee, with no dick.
You're not an asshole for wanting to attracted sexually to your partner. Also I thought we settled this years earlier but you can't select who you're attracted to, that was the point of the whole movement!!!
Big, small, black, white, blue, green, red, asian, man, woman, etc. as long as it is a consenting adult love what you love.
As for people saying your bi-phobic for not dating bisexuals, read my last part again, some people find some genitals disgusting (e.g. dicks) and just the thought of it might put them off entirely (god knows I'm not going down there after some bloke, have a shower and we'll think about it).
So in conclusion: FUCK OFF AND LET PEOPLE LOVE WHOM THEY LOVE!!

I've always identified as bi really but I don't think that's right. Like in terms of finding someone to fall in love with, idgaf if you're a girl or a boy or non binary or trans or cis or what genitals people have or any of that - it really isn't important to me at all, just some people are really fckin beautiful and more importantly some people are really lovely (obviously I care about your identity because I care about you as a person I just mean it's not a factor that comes into play when I'm attracted to someone). So I guess that would make me pan? But I don't rlly identify with that... and I know labels aren't important and stuff but for me labels are useful and I like them because I struggle with a lot of stuff about myself. And I feel like telling people I'm bi isn't right because it's kinda shutting people out you know? Like bi typically is associated with only 2? But I'm not only attracted to 2 genders, I'm not attracted to people on the basis of gender at all!! I got the whole spectrum of genders, I'm just attracted to cool ass people 🥴 So yeah that's kinda weird for me at the moment and I'm sorry this is so badly worded but pls if anyone has any advice that would be nice

I've always identified as bi really but I don't think that's right. Like in terms of finding someone to fall in love with, idgaf if you're a girl or a boy or non binary or trans or cis or what genitals people have or any of that - it really isn't important to me at all, just some people are really fckin beautiful and more importantly some people are really lovely (obviously I care about your identity because I care about you as a person I just mean it's not a factor that comes into play when I'm attracted to someone). So I guess that would make me pan? But I don't rlly identify with that... and I know labels aren't important and stuff but for me labels are useful and I like them because I struggle with a lot of stuff about myself. And I feel like telling people I'm bi isn't right because it's kinda shutting people out you know? Like bi typically is associated with only 2? But I'm not only attracted to 2 genders, I'm not attracted to people on the basis of gender at all!! I got the whole spectrum of genders, I'm just attracted to cool ass people 🥴 So yeah that's kinda weird for me at the moment and I'm sorry this is so badly worded but pls if anyone has any advice that would be nice

As the author of #Brumfess42024 I honestly wasn’t expecting it to get so much good feedback. Here are some great new additions to the list I’ve received...
Sell Joseph Chamberlain blowup sex dolls or alternatively Sir David Eastwood piñatas. Disadvantage: the piñatas might sell out too quickly
Put a lift inside Old Joe and turn it into a zipline that takes you to the bottom of Selly so you don’t have to risk getting mugged on the walk down or bumping into that girl you shagged the night before and haven’t texted back, Jack...
Please keep them coming

I have been sleeping with one guy for the past 10 months and have had a crush on him for two years. I finally told him I liked him and wanted something more. He said he didn’t and that we should just be friends.
He was the longest “relationship” I have ever had and I think I was in love with him.

TLDR: pressure to come out to parents
I’ve discussed how I’m pretty sure I’m bi with a few friends who’ve been supportive but even that was terrifying.
(I still tick straight on some forms and feel guilty about it but calling myself bi feels too real)
I’ve been bonding with a friend of mine over this experience; he recently came out but is leaps ahead - very sure of his sexuality and has told most of his friends and family etc
Discussing this with him makes me feel pressured to do the same but
a) I’m not even 100% sure how I identify
b) My parents have made subtly biphobic and ignorant comments in the past even about friends of mine and I think they would be unintentionally unsupportive and dismissive of my feelings
Sometimes I think I might just call myself straight at least to them but I feel dishonest and bad for taking the easy route of being straight passing
Can I just call myself straight forever and just be out to a select few? Or am I at risk of leaving it too late and it being weirder if I do decide to come out later?
I also wonder if part of this is shame from growing up Catholic/ being in a heteronormative society ngl

During lockdown I really needed to earn some extra money as I wasn’t getting any furlough pay. I started doing private webcam shows on a well known cam site. I got a request from a name I recognised but couldn’t place for something extra, they wanted a private video chat. Normally I don’t enjoy these private shows or calls, getting paid to do something so intimate. This time, however, was the best orgasm I’ve ever been paid to have.
As soon as the call connected, I was able to put a face to the name.
I haven’t been able to stop thinking about that night since. He requested private calls every night after that until I eventually stopped charging.
It’s been 7 weeks and we haven’t gone a day without video chatting. He really fulfils my fantasies and I know that I fulfil his. Now comes the dilemma, he’s requested something we’ve never discussed before. We’ve arranged to finally meet up and for our first time he wants me to role play a school girl while he dominates.
I’m very conflicted what to do, especially since he’s my old history teacher.

I’ve just come back from my ya after sticking it it out on my own in my host country through the worst of the lockdown and now it’s getting a little better people who went there and ran home are flying out again, basically just for a holiday.
Am I wrong to feel really pissed off by them? Like, they came home just in time for a last couple of nights out and mum’s dinner while I obediently self isolated and struggled alone through the whole thing and now I’m coming back to find people going out there just to escape the uk having some really unrestrictive (and totally insufficient but that’s another argument) lockdown rules. I just feel kinda like it’s unfair to enjoy the new freedom there when they weren’t there when the police would arrest you for trying to go out and pay your bills ya know xox

i’m just so disgusted at the comments made by wiley on twitter tonight. i’m not jewish, but i want to do anything i can to help the jewish community at uob and in the rest of my life. can anyone who’s jewish teach me the right things i should be doing & saying in response to this? (i don’t want to sound like “please educate me because i am too lazy to do the work”, i want to genuinely hear from real jewish people about what’s best for them & implement it)

Not being funny but do we need a new Brumfess/Brumble? Seems like most of the new posts are just the 'regulars' circlejerking in the comments and writing posts about themselves. Pretty boring tbh
I miss the good old days when Brumfess was actually confessions and people asking questions and getting advice. I miss when Old Joemance was new and people were posting their crushes and random encounters in Selly 😔

I've never been happy with my weight. When I was younger I always thought I was massively overweight, though looking back I really really wasn't. Now when I see how much weight I've gained, and it just makes me feel empty (almost ironic, but I can't think of a better word).
I'm by far the heaviest of my friends and its just not a nice feeling. I know our worth isn't determined on how we look or how much we weight, but still. I don't have the time to go to the gym (not that I've ever been and the concept actually sorta terrifies me). I've started working out with YouTube videos again, but haven't managed to stick with it before, so who know if I will this time.
I look at who I am now, and I don't think I really recognize me. In how I look, feel, how my hobbies have changed/disappeared etc. It's not the biggest problem in the world, but it's not a nice feeling.
Hope whoevers reading this has a great rest of your day and gets a good night's sleep. thanks fr listening to just another random girl on brumfess

I’m obsessed about how I look, I don’t care about anything else, any internal qualities like intelligence, kindness, humour or accomplishments aren’t important to me. Just how I physically look. That’s not normal is it? How do I stop caring about it.

So bit of a juicy confession...
In the student houses I've lived in I've generally been the first to move in and stay over summer. Sometimes due to boredom my partner would come visit. One time we got a bit drunk and made a pact to fuck in all rooms of the house (except bathrooms because that's just nasty) and side then we've kept our pact. Doing all sorts of sexy business in my mates bedrooms and in the kitchen before they all moved in and obviously never told them!!
Best sexy time ever- suggest you all try it ❤

First year I had one. She was a trained private counsellor in psychotherapy. However, she literally couldn’t offer me any mental health support because thats not what she was being paid for with me. Is what she said.
She would Literally ask me what I was doing in uni if I had any deadlines and in my subject we didnt really have anything major and she checked I was organised. Which i am extremely. Therefore I thought it was a waste of time and stopped going.

Well let's change this ignorant viewpoint
Nurses and doctors are identified as key workers but got excluded from the pay increase which other key workers got due to covid-19.
Nurses and doctors did not expect to be putting their health and life at risk when joining their professions, and they should not be expected to either, with healthcare you are close to the patient, in teaching for example you cannot move them, you can keep your distance, but nursing is hands on, nursing includes; Moving them, inserting catheters/cannulas, blood/urine/vomit/other bodily fluids on you and your clothing far too many times to count. Shop workers get more protection from covid-19 as they may have plastic shields between the customers and the employee but doctors and nurses have a surgical mask and gloves, those who work in healthcare cannot stay 1 metre apart from a patient.

Since being at home I have had such negative thoughts about my physical appearance to the point where I don’t want to leave the house. I feel embarrassed to confide in anyone because it shouldn’t hold so much weight to me, or that people think I’m fishing for compliments. My friends from home are physically very attractive and always tell each other how beautiful they are but never me which makes me think they secretly think I’m ugly. Even my ex used to highlight things I’m insecure about and dumped me for someone else and that they were no longer attracted to me. Again it shouldn’t be important to think about so much but I feel embarrassed to leave the house over my face and body.

I’m probably being stupid so any advice is very helpful. I’ve recently applied to do separate masters (like not integrated) so I will starting the course this October, and finishing/handing in my dissertation the following October. I understood that the majority of graduate schemes have summer start dates, aimed at people who graduate in the July. Are there other graduate schemes aimed at masters students who finish at the end of the summer and graduate in December instead? Or do I wait until the following summer to start? I know all companies are probably a bit different but any experience and advice would be much appreciated.

Tfw you're usually super confident and self-assured, but lockdowns got you stressed and isolated and you can feel the anxiety creeping in.
Got told I've put on weight over lockdown. Now I can't find anything to wear that i feel comfortable in.
Got told that my diet is poor and i should change it up because my skin is looking bad. Now i dont do anything before i put on makeup.
Got told my accents suck when i sing (i do a lot of musical theatre). Now i dont have the motivation to sing and when i do i over-analyse everything I'm doing.
Mind what you say to people because even those you think are super resilient can suffer with their mental health.

This is such an ignorant take. If you're referring to people who lecture others about their experiences and are condescending, then yah no one should do that, but virtue signalling & voluntary ignorance isn't exclusive to white people and you aren't accomplishing anything by making this statement, but only creating more divide. If you genuinely think white people have nothing to contribute to the conversation about race, then you are clearly blinded by this idea that white people are 'the other'. I used to carry a lot of internalised racism without knowing it, and my white friends got me to understand how ungrateful I was of my own culture and experiences because a lot of them don't have that. EVERYONE has a perspective. You can never address the issue of racism by being exclusionary, you only create a tit-for-tat that does nothing for anyone.
I'm not saying I haven't dealt with white people who try to tell me my experiences are not valid, I HAVE. But to then say because these people are trying to invalidate me, that ALL white people can't tell POCs about their activism isn't just. It's just as ignorant. Everyone has different knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to provide. The holier-than-thou attitude is not exclusive to race.

Jesus christ can we not go back to the whole seminar debate of a few months ago? Some people fucking have anxiety or depression or for whatever reason they don't have the confidence to contribute even if they've done the work. Why are you telling them to ""just stay home if they're not going to say anything""? At least they showed up in the first place and maybe they showed up because they want to ask the seminar leader questions in private after, not in front of the whole group. Plus ATTENDANCE IS A THING do you not think whatever department that's teaching them would notice they've just stopped showing up? Mind your own business and stop making people feel like shit to make yourself feel superior.

Until recently I didn't realise how lucky I was, I am a 20 year old woman and have never experienced unwanted sexual advances or contact until today. My co-worker sexually assaulted me at work - I was tidying up something he had dropped and he spanked my ass.
I know this isn't major and by no means am I comparing it to anything traumatic that many people my age have gone through, but it made me think. In that moment I was numb, I was angry, I felt violated. But then the doubt sinks in, is it my fault, was I flirting, I didn't think I was, maybe i gave the wrong impression?
No, I was assaulted and it was his fault.
I'm writing this just to give an insight into what these brave survivors of sexual assault go through. Immediately we want to forgive and take some blame, I was actually so shocked and numb I didn't bring it up at the time. But we know it is wrong, so do not victim shame, being and feeling violated really crushes you for a period of time and until you have been assaulted/abused you have no idea how it can affect you.
In a world where you can be anything, be kind xx

Because the 4% is actually over 6 years and equates to around 0.7% increase a year. This pay increase also comes after a 10 year pay freeze, so nurses wages didn’t increase for 10 years and are still not in line with inflation increases over the same time period. Oh and nurses also battled a global pandemic, but go off I guess.

Seeing as it’s an ongoing debate I thought I’d add my opinion on reverse racism/sexism (for reference I am a straight, white male... shock)
I pretty firmly don’t believe in reverse racism. The term racism is far more than a dictionary definition due to the 300 years or so of history behind the word. Obviously racism stems further back than that however the white domination of the world during the age of expansion is in my opinion responsible for the majority of modern day racism.
Reverse sexism I think is far more simple to explain. I believe it absolutely exists as so many fellow straight white males have already been so quick to point out. However I think what us men need to understand is that sexism towards men today, is a product of how modern society was set up a century or so ago... by straight white men. So 100% campaign for awareness on male issues, but understand why these issues exist instead of using it as retaliation to the feminist movement.

In lack of proper confessions, here's one from my first year
I was dating someone who lived in Birmingham, and her sister was cute, so I slept with her one night when my girlfriend was working
We had an affair for the first year and then I failed my first year and didn't return to Birmingham so the relationship ended
I matched her, recently divorced, mother on tinder which I found was weird since I live down south. It turns out they had moved because of her dad, so I spoke to her a bit under a fake tinder before meeting up with her and sleeping with her
Needless to say, 3 years later I still have no degree but have just proposed to the original girlfriend who has no idea what has happened in the mean time

Ya’ll can fuck off HAHHAHAA no one’s ‘stealing’ your ideas if you’re the one actively deciding to contribute and vocalise your ideas to the group. You’ve got a major individual superiority complex if you honestly think quiet people or those with anxiety sit in a seminar to ‘steal’ your ideas. As a side, have you ever considered that some people have not been socialised in the same way as you, and have grown up to internalise the belief that their voice is less valid or valued in academic environments xxxx The loudest people in the room aint always the brightest and when you see me writing whilst you’re speaking it’s probably because I’m writing down all the flaws in your shitty argument babe xx

AM I CHEATING??
I love my partner of 3 plus years. I've had crushes in this time and been completely open about it. Open relationships aren't for us, we're monogamous and personally threesomes and stuff are off the table either.
I feel bad because I'm not sure what constitutes emotional cheating.
I adore the ground they walk on, want to have kids with them, but have been thinking and dreaming about hooking up with someone else. This someone else I know for a fact is interested in me a bit. Haven't done anything but really wondering if it's normal to have thoughts about what if, and this is just a side effect of being in a long term relationship? Getting dumb crushes and odd sexy thoughts?
Note :I don't adore my partner any less. Our sez is great and I feel totally fulfilled. So am I just a douche? Feel like I'm committing a thought crime
Replies from people in long term relationships or experience of relationships over 3 years would be hella useful
And pls be nice

Honestly can’t deal with commenters today. If you are in a seminar of 10 people and only 2 are talking, it’s obviously not because 8 people have clinical anxiety is it?!?! It pains me that people dive to the exceptions.
If you have anxiety, nobody is annoyed at you for not speaking. But the majority of people that are silent in seminars DO NOT have clinical anxiety.
It’s the same path of logic which boomers are using to justify not wearing masks ‘yeah, but some people have life threatening lung conditions’. I expect more of Russel group educated people.

I have a girlfriend and a side thing situation going on.... my gf said she’s ok with it and my side also said she doesn’t want anything serious so it’s fine for us to just mess around. My gf is now being very funny about it.... I said at the start of our relationship the only way I’m getting into a relationship is if it’s open. She is allowed to go and have flings and has kissed people on nights out etc. But then come home crying to me apologising (sometimes when my side has been over and she has had to leave making it very awkward!!!). I understand that this is not the situation she wants but I also cannot change the way I feel and the way I want to live my life. I love my girlfriend but not in a monogamous way...

When looking electricity provides its important to know that ""100% renewable"" tariffs don't make a difference to how much green electricity is produced. These tariffs do nothing to change how much green electricity is produced due to the system surrounding green electricity certificates.

Your entire spiel has been made redundant simply because you used the word, ‘reverse’ implying that it’s reactionary. Call it what it is, sexism or racism. When people say, “you can’t experience x because you’re x” they’re talking about systemic racism and systematic sexism. Not individual cases. If they are talking about individual cases saying it’s still not racism/sexism then yah, they’re wrong.
Sexism:
Don’t get it twisted, men can DEFINITELY experience SYSTEMIC sexism. There are laws globally that make it difficult for men to gain custody of their children, implicit bias in the judicial system that makes men more likely to be incarcerated and for a longer time than women, and there is a law in the UK that literally has a key gendered distinction on rape. Just because other men put those laws in place doesn’t negate the fact that men are universally disproportionately affected by it.
This is to people who refute this idea and are so adamant on making divisive arguments that accomplish nothing:
I am a POC woman who is a proud strong feminist, but you are the kind of people that make the movement look like it’s not about equality. Calling a spade a spade is important, and is a necessity to identify issues to combat problems of sexism. But when you make random broad statements like men can’t experience sexism not only do you sound uneducated, but you’re not identifying an issue and trying to work towards fixing it, you’re using decisive rhetoric that contributes NOTHING and accomplishes NOTHING aside from more partisanship. The fight is about how the patriarchy has affected both men and women and how we can achieve equality together, NOT about how men can’t experience sexism at all. And when you do this, you contribute to the stigmatisation that men can’t speak about their problems because their experiences aren’t real due to your incorrect interpretation of a definition.
I’m assuming all these arguments are targeted towards saying, “men are trash”. Yah, that’s not sexist and if you’re whining about a phrase that doesn’t affect men to a point of mental and physical danger that can also systemically contribute towards their oppression like historically many slogans created to oppress women, then you’re deluded and are making it harder for other men who are fighting actual oppressive issues men deal with.
Racism:
A lot of you are using assumptions relative to only what you’ve seen in the UK and it’s not an accurate representation of what racism is. Not only am I a POC, but I have lived in many countries around the world and I have continuously seen first-hand every single race experience racism. I’ll use an example: Indians have a cultural and global renowned stereotype that they are intelligent. Indians in India perceive white people as not as smart when it comes to academia. White kids in schools in India face people asserting this superiority complex over them undermining their intellectual capabilities solely based on their race creating a stereotype threat that can affect their understanding of intelligence and stunt their intellectual growth their entire life. YES there is no system in place oppressing white people WE BEEN KNEW. But by saying white people can’t experience racism at all is just wrong, and accomplishes nothing towards the fight against racism because all you’re doing is alienating an entire race and not actually identifying issues that you can work towards solving.
Conclusion:
Everyone’s main issue is when people draw false equivalences. You’re totally right, the second the people who haven’t been historically oppressed are trying to make claims that their experiences are equates to BIPOCs and women, that’s what is wrong. But claiming that they don’t have experiences AT ALL is what makes you just as wrong as someone drawing a false equivalence. You will not accomplish anything from an us-vs-them mentality. It is necessary for people to recognise the mistakes they’re making to contribute to the problem and yes you should call THAT out, but it will never be solved if your aim is to antagonise. The only way you accomplish fighting sexism is fighting it with all sexes. And the only way you fight racism is making sure no race believes they are superior to another solely based on race.

Nobody cares about the court case alleging that Trump r*ped a 13 year old girl and abused other young girls (I mean just look at pictures of him and Ivanka when she was young). Nobody cares that he has ties to Epstein and Maxwell. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets re-elected in November because it seems nobody gives a shit about all the young girls being exploited.

To whomever was walking down Rookery Road at 3:30 this morning, as much as you may find it funny to knock on people's windows whilst they're asleep, I don't and would appreciate it if you don't do that again, as sleep is difficult for me to come by to begin with.

A real confession: I am a bi man and have known I am bi for several years. I haven't come out because I am in a serious committed relationship with a woman. So I pass as straight, and might as well be straight since I envisage spending the rest of my life with her and we are exclusive. And life just seems easier as a straight man so why bother with the hassle of coming out...

Tw- harassment

So last year I went out with my older sister for her birthday. We're both from a small town, shes never left and I moved to brum for uni, so I'm used to this kind of thing and I'm used to standing up for myself in a call way. We went out first to a local pub, and I was feeling myself! You can say it ladies (and everyone else! Side note to love yourself)
I was at the bar and a man came behind me, looked me up and down and touched my arse and said ""what is a woman like you doing in a place like this, let me buy you a drink"" and I was just in shock. I just scoffed at him and walked away, quite shaken up not knowing what to do. Upon leaving I decided to confront him about it and I said to him that what he did was very inappropriate, it made me cery uncomfortable and be shouldn't treat women that way. He had no right to touch me.
My sister got so mad at me for saying something, she said that ""you can't dress like that and expect men not to hit on you""
I was In jeans and a body suit.
Mmm men can flirt in a way that doesnt involve physically touching you and making you feel uncomfortable. I manage to restrain from groping any man I find attractive so it isnt that hard. I was super quiet and collected about it as well because I'd rather educate him than shout at him, and she said ""I caused a scene with my feminist bollocks""
I have no idea what posting this on brumfess is going to do, she just brought it up again today and she still thinks I did the wrong thing and ""ruined the night"" in her words. I guess I just need to get the frustration out because I can't get a word in whenever I try to dispute it, and I have tried.
Keep standing up for yourself ladies, I don't care what she says, I did the right thing. The frustration of having to convince her is what's bugged me I guess!

Hi Brumfess,
I am having a dilemma. One of my modules for next year is listed online in multiple places as having a different name. (it’s an English Third Year module - New York Poetics). However, when I was choosing the modules it was advertised as New York Poetics, but now on the module allocation form it is called ‘multiple voices’ and on the programme and modules handbook it is called ‘modern american poetry’. Is this likely to be all the same module?

If anyone asked me if I would recommend studying at UoB my answer would be a hard no. The way they have treated students throughout the strikes and Corona virus has been nothing short of terrible. At UoB I don't even feel like a human I just feel like a number on a page to them and to say we're paying 9,250 pound a year for this is unacceptable. At college I really felt like I was cared for and each one of the teachers went well out their way to ensure you succeed even working overtime and on weekends unpaid to offer extra sessions for students whereas at this university you get 1 or 2 hours of office hours per week to ask for help and that's it and when you do go for help they couldn't care less. The teaching quality has also been of a very low standard, so much so that there have been a number of lectures I had to stop going to and just teach myself the content as it was a much better usage of my time but for how much I'm paying I shouldn't have to do that. If I could do uni all over again it most certainly wouldn't be at UoB.

So I’ve just finished my first year at UoB, and it’s been a pretty shit year mentally, personally and of course generally. I’ve really struggled with making friends and it’s got me really down about coming back to Birmingham, I can be a pretty anxious and closeted person and as much as I try in seminars, etc, I just feel so isolated and everyone seemed to form their friendship groups so quickly I kinda lost hope. I’m so lucky to have met my housemates and I love them to bits but I just want to make this year better, I don’t want to feel to anxious to go on nights out anymore!
I study joint honors Literature with History, I’m not massively interesting to be fair lol but I just want to make more friends and push myself to be as social as possible this year!! If anyone wouldn’t mind to get chatting if you comment on this I’ll message you? 🥺
Soz for the rant this isn’t something I’d usually post but I can’t stop worrying about being isolated and lonely again this year so it’s worth a try I guess :)

So I’ve just finished my first year at UoB, and it’s been a pretty shit year mentally, personally and of course generally. I’ve really struggled with making friends and it’s got me really down about coming back to Birmingham, I can be a pretty anxious and closeted person and as much as I try in seminars, etc, I just feel so isolated and everyone seemed to form their friendship groups so quickly I kinda lost hope. I’m so lucky to have met my housemates and I love them to bits but I just want to make this year better, I don’t want to feel to anxious to go on nights out anymore!
I study joint honors Literature with History, I’m not massively interesting to be fair lol but I just want to make more friends and push myself to be as social as possible this year!! If anyone wouldn’t mind to get chatting if you comment on this I’ll message you? 🥺
Soz for the rant this isn’t something I’d usually post but I can’t stop worrying about being isolated and lonely again this year so it’s worth a try I guess :)

Suggestions please!
So my 20yo sister (in college) has been really reaaaaly acting up since lockdown restrictions have started being eased. My long-distance bf has moved down to stay with us for several weeks as I hadn't seen him since the start of lockdown. We (fam and him) went and got socially distanced fish and chip takeaway and ate it on the beach. I took a few selfies with my sister then asked her to take a pic of me and bf. She took it and has been acting out since, acting like a toddler and refusing to do anything useful. She has just been bashing around the house since we got back and is refusing to let anyone sleep, even though we all have work (from home) in the morning.
We think she feels a sense of loss and severe FOMO. Our dad passed away a few years ago from illness but she wasn't around when he passed so she's not wanted to be excluded from anything since then in case she misses anything - this I sort of understand. She hasn't seen many of her friends in lockdown as she doesn't drive and we live in the countryside so no public transport (not that she would have gone when it was essential travel only), yet my bf has been here for a couple of weeks and will be here for several more (note that me and bf don't share room as mum not happy with it, even tho we are 22 and 24...) This feeling about not seeing her friends even tho bf is here I sort of understand. She has seen a few friends recently and has had lots of video calls so she has t been completely cut off. She has also stayed with grandma for a few days
HOWEVER, she just doesn't talk to us about it, instead trashed the house, stomps around, shouts and basically does the opposite of what anyone asks her reasonably to do. She doesn't like being the last one in her room or asleep so she keeps us up until she goes to bed, which is highly unfair on everyone.
Does anyone have any suggestions of who she could talk to?? We got in touch with the grief counsellor we spoke to after dad passed but they are now on a couple weeks deserved holiday, and she really needs to speak to someone sooner rather than later. Any suggestions appreciated, ty

Biggest frustration on dating apps rn is when im trying to find women to speak to and connect with, only to have 90% of the profiles i have to scroll through be men.
What are you hoping to gain?! If i wanted a guy, i would have selected the option saying 'i want to see men'. No wlw (even those like me who are bi) are going to be like 'ik i wanted to see women, but damn this man who is trying to trick me is finnnee, i definitely want him in me'.

The fact you “don’t know” what you did so wrong to make people dislike you and want to distance themselves from you speaks more about your character than anything. Spreading serious lies/rumours about people, constantly slagging them off and trying to turn people against them isn’t a way to keep friends and no one should have to explain that to you.

So I’m coming up to 2 years on sertraline and it’s been really good for me, and I had a good experience getting counselling through the university, however I’ve now finished the sessions they’ll allow me to have and I’m looking at what’s best to do next. Like I don’t want to be on antidepressants my whole life and counselling had a good effect but I’m not feeling ready to come off yet so I guess I go for more counselling. Just looking for any advice/ people who have been through this situation and recommendations of ways to get support/counselling, whether I go back to the GP, back to the university mental health or one of the charities in Birmingham (if so which is best)

I understand your point and I’m honestly not that bothered if weed is legalised or not, either way I won’t be taking it as I have bad anxiety and it only seems to exacerbate this. But I think people should recognise that we know a lot about the effects of alcohol however much less about marijuana due to its illegal status. More tests need to be carried out before it can be legalised to ensure the drug and its effects are fully understood and potential negative effects can be minimised. I also think we need to be cautious in how weed can sometimes become a gateway drug to more dangerous ones, perhaps in a way alcohol does not as the ‘buzz’ doesn’t necessarily wear off in the same way (I don’t drink much but my friends who drink/smoke weed and now do harder drugs have told me this).

Seeing as there’s been a few juicy confessions recently I thought I should own up. A little over a year ago I was working behind the counter in infusion on the Vale. About half way through the evening a girl came up to ask if the Mac and cheese was vegan, being the good lil uni employee i am 😇 I checked the allergy sheet the staff had given me, where it stated “Macaroni : vegan”. Happy that it was safe for her to eat I dished it up. Under the light so could tell how stringy the cheese was, I started to doubt myself that this could be vegan cheese.... but I had read the sheet so?? Must be fine.
Once she had gone I checked the sheet once more, and realised waaaaaay further down the sheet listed with the jacket potatoes it read “macaroni cheese : contains milk” 😭😭 I felt AWFUL about this, the allergy sheet was really badly designed and read in a very misleading way. I was terrified the girl would come back and complain 🙃 if this was you, know that I am so sorry and it was a genuine mistake on my part and a f up on the part of infusion, I really hope the real Mac and cheese didn’t give you the bum gravy 😭😭

The comments on this are seriously confusing to me. The girlfriend in this scenario has caused this, yet she's the victim? She may be insecure, but is that an excuse to create such an awkward situation for your boyfriend? It's evident the OP came about as a bit of a narcissist, but I'd say that's a result of his girlfriend constantly making him uncomfortable, with this mindset being his 'reassurance'. Sorry, but there's no excuse to put someone in such a toxic environment as the OP's girlfriend has done here - no matter how insecure they are.

Sell Joseph Chamberlain blowup sex dolls or alternatively Sir David Eastwood piñatas. Disadvantage: the piñatas might sell out too quickly
Put a lift inside Old Joe and turn it into a zipline that takes you to the bottom of Selly so you don’t have to risk getting mugged on the walk down or bumping into that girl you shagged the night before and haven’t texted back

Why is the ""friend zone"" even a thing? Have you thought about how it makes girls view themselves? It actually makes them feel guilty for not allowing a romance to bloom whenever they make any new male friend. Sorry for not falling in love with all of my guy friends like they deserve? How about we turn this around and create the term ""girlfriend zone"" for when boys only want something more. Do you know how many times I have met a boy and we got along and I was happy and excited to make a new friend but when it became clear I wasn't interested in them non platonically they just cut me off? It makes me feel like shit thinking that guys only want me in that way and don't value me as a friend. And yes the majority of the time I've heard people use this in real life and in pop culture is when a boy is rejected by a girl.

Honestly there is no normal or standard. Every relationship is different and it’s for the both of you to decide what you want out of your relationship. Things can get really hard but if you love each other and believe it’s worth working through then you do that. That being said it is a concern if your health or safety is at direct risk from the relationship.

UoB has recently been announced as one of the Russell group universities’ finances that will be hit hardest by corona virus!!
Here are some ideas to save UoB:
Old Joe could be converted into a brothel.
Disadvantages: Old Joe would not be happy about being “pimped out,” he can’t consent, and he has a dysfunctional c(l)ock.
However, there still could be a sex shop inside that sells UoB sexual pariphalnalia, for example, an Old Joe dildo, blow-up sex dolls that you could customise to resemble your favourite lecturer, a UoB gimp mask (this could be part of a package deal: buy a gimp mask, get a UoB face mask free).
The Vale lake could start to cruises liners, with activities like scuba diving, hook- an actual- duck, paragliding and battle ships.
Slap sellly student tuesdays- On this day Selly oak locals, many of whom have received years of grief from students, get to slap a student. This could be pay-as-go and/or membership.
Fight nights- The Aston web building (great hall) could be converted into an arena with BCU and Aston students fighting to the death.
Reality TV show where Maple Bank and Chamberlian students do a life swap to see how the other half lives. This would give the university more publicity.
Maple Bank could be converted into a zoo (open to anyone) Advantage: you wouldn’t need any extra animals, the students already in there would be enough.

UoB has recently been announced as one of the Russell group universities’ finances that will be hit hardest by corona virus!!
Here are some ideas to save UoB:
Old Joe could be converted into a brothel.
Disadvantages: Old Joe would not be happy about being “pimped out,” he can’t consent, and he has a dysfunctional c(l)ock.

Someone please help me... I have the worst anxiety ever, I struggle to walk alone anywhere, enters shops alone, drive alone, I can not cope with being in public but I want to be independent. Almost feels like I’m a confident person stuck inside an under confident persons body and I’m so sick of feeling this way... I wish I can walk down the shops alone but it’s impossible. When I walk towards one person or a group, I look at the floor and feel so anxious. How can I fix this, I am getting very desperate. Thank you

Recently had a pretty drunken Zoom call with a few friends, and after a while they started going on about relationships and sex in lockdown. One thing came to another and I eventually let slip that I'd never been sexually/romantically intimate with someone. Part of me wishes I'd just kept my mouth shut. They looked at me like a dog that's just had it's back legs run over, and it's ridiculous. This is my choice. Given all the shit I've been through, I don't think I'd have the mental or emotional capacity to have sex with someone (much less a full on relationship) and not break down. I don't care if it takes five months or five years, but I'd rather become secure in who I really am than try to snip the V plate off at first glance whilst not even being able to look at myself in the mirror.
I'm in my twenties and I've never had a snog. So what? I'm only just starting to live my best life for the first time ever. The rest will all come around someday, just not yet.

People seem a bit confused about selling off the NHS being a stab in the back to medical staff. Just to be clear, one reason the NHS is so effective and cheap relative to other systems is that they are able to better negotiate prices for goods and services because of their size. This means cheaper drugs but it also means lower paid medical staff compared to a private system like the USA.
Not saying I am pro privatisation, obviously id prefer to continue to get cheap quality medical care but just seems weird to suggest privatisation betrays medical staff when, if anything, it would make their jobs easier and pay higher.

Not saying I am pro privatisation, obviously id prefer to continue to get cheap quality medical care but just seems weird to suggest privatisation betrays medical staff when, if anything, it would make their jobs easier and pay higher.

I'm a PG student and I hate my dissertation, I don't want to work on it anymore. My supervisor generates a horrible amount of unnecessary work for me by requesting me to do every kind of statistical analysis under the sun because the results don't seem significant. Why the hell can't I just say it wasn't significant, our hypothesis was wrong? I'm sick of it and I have no idea how I'm going to explain why I did what I did because if it was up to me, I would have done things differently. I'm stressed about this shitty dissertation all the time and everyone keeps saying 'oh you'll definitely get an A, you always get As' and I feel literally nauseous from the pressure because I don't feel like this is my best work.

People should be free to use whatever bathroom they want as long as it correlates with their gender identity. Trans women are women and should be made welcome in female bathrooms. Trans men are men and should be given access to male bathrooms without fear of harassment. However, I do not agree that we should eradicate segregated bathrooms in favour of only unisex toilets in certain institutions. Ideally, there should be male, female and unisex facilities everywhere, however I know space limitations may complicate this. Research has shown that school girls just getting their period experience shame that is exacerbated if they need to use unisex facilities. My school always had male, female and unisex toilets that everyone would freely use, apart from girls when they were on their period. I think night clubs too should 100% have all free options as I know a lot of women use the female bathroom to escape from unwanted male attention and alcohol may fuel violence against trans people or non-binary people so there should be a unisex option for them to use if they feel too intimidated or unsafe in their gender identity bathroom (which of course they should never have to experience, however unfortunately still do). I think when people (especially women) complain about trans people using their bathroom, it stems from their fear of cis men infringing upon their ‘safe spaces’, however transwomen also need to be protected from cismen and so should be natural allies.

Anyone else feel really bad for Will Hughes? He’s running his socks off every goal, going in for tackles and giving his all. He’s the only one in the team who looks like he cares about keeping this club in the premier league. It’s a shame he’s surrounded by donkeys who couldn’t care about the club as long as they get paid. We have to build the team around him next season, and make him captain whilst you’re at it.

He’s the only one in the team who looks like he cares about keeping this club in the premier league. It’s a shame he’s surrounded by donkeys who couldn’t care about the club as long as they get paid. We have to build the team around him next season, and make him captain whilst you’re at it.

It was recently suggested by my therapist that I have quite a serious mental illness and she strongly reccomened I get formally diagnosed to get the proper medication required. I'm really scared that I'll be sectioned tho and I'm not entirely sure of the process and requirements they have to admit me against my will.

I’m in an open relationship and find it really hard to find other people that are willing to get involved with me because of that. I also want to explore my bisexuality but then when I tell another girl that I have a boyfriend and that we’re open and things they never seem to be interested after that. I’ve always been completely honest about my situation, I would never want to start something with someone without letting them know that but it seems to be an instant turn off for everyone I’ve met. All I want is a girl to chill out with and fool around with if they want to. Is that wrong? Do I sound awful??

Hello so im currently in the process of being diagnosed with something more than depression and anxiety by forward thinking birmingham. I have been with them for 3 years and my
Situation has become even more complex. They really haven’t got a clue what’s wrong with me. Ive had a mixture of counselling probably around 7 diffrent counsellors , 2 cbt and 1 high intensity cbt and none have worked over 8years. Nothing has worked. including serataline and citalopram. The community mental health nurse originally said autistic traits, then she changed to maybe adhd /
Add. Then she left her job and my new nurse said bpd. Because im emotioanlly
Unstable .its really confusing and i really dont want labels but i feel like the only way i can get better is to have a diagnosis so they know how to treat me. They are telling me they can only attempt to go through the diagnosis programme one at a time. So first adhd/add.
Can Anyone share any experiences of going through the diagnosis process of add, adhd, any personality disorder or bi polar with forward thinking birmingham. Thank you

Hoping for some genuine opinions on this one cos I’m that bored I’m debating with myself on hypothetical matters. I see private healthcare as morally wrong and support free healthcare for everyone. So morally, I would be against paying for treatment and handing over money to the private healthcare industry. Buuuut obviously the NHS is facing difficulties and is severely underfunded. So as someone in the privileged position of being able to afford private treatment, wouldn’t it be the right thing to do to go private so as not to put further strain on the NHS/take a spot away from someone who can’t afford private care. Discuss x

Help a guy out.
1st year, when i went to urinal, everything was fine, just pissed as normal.
For some random reason at some point I just couldn't pee at a urinal anymore and need a cubicle, even if the door is still open. Not really a shy guy, I'd just be stood at the urinal with my knob out but not peeing unless I pushed really hard but still not completely peeing it all out until i hit a cubicle.
Anyone else ever had this issue and if so any tips. I prefer to use a urinal as often the lines for cubicles can be long
Again, dont know why this happens, especially since I never used to have this issue, just like one day and then boom, same ever since.

Just really want to say how hurtful it can be to be skinny shamed. I think some people genuinely don't think it's offensive to comment on how skinny you are just because media etc portrays skinny to be the most desirable body shape. They think that some one couldn't possibly be offended by being called skinny. I am honestly fed up of how many times in my life a woman has commented on my body shape. I am tall and naturally slim (and healthy) and have had the following comments:
1) I returned to work after Christmas holidays and my colleague's first words to me weren't ""Did you have a nice Christmas?"". They were ""omg have you lost weight?!"" No one would say ""omg have you gained weight?!"" so why is it ok when some one suspects some one of losing weight? What's frustrating is that I actually hadn't lost any weight.
2) I was on my last day of a weekend job and my colleague said ""I won't hug you goodbye as I don't want to break you as you're so skinny"". What the hell?!! That isn't even possible.
3) Another colleague was behind the till with me and literally punched me in the leg and angrily said ""how are you so skinny? Do you just not eat?"" which again is ridiculous considering I eat just as much as the average person and this woman was clearly jealous.
It's not ok to comment on some one's weight just because they are slim, not overweight!!!

How do I stop being so squeamish? As a kid I had no problems with blood, gore and medical things, in fact I used to find my dad’s squeamishness pretty funny. But in the last couple of years I can’t stand the sight of blood, I have to look away from gory murder scenes in films and a mention of any unpleasant medical procedure makes me feel extremely sick. This would be fine but I really want to donate blood but I’m very worried that slowly watching my blood go into a bag would make me throw up or faint. I was thinking about trying to do CBT style exposure, but the problem is it’s not fear or anxiety it’s just disgust so I don’t know if it’ll work. Any tips?

It’s not unreasonable for health and social care workers to want better pay when they literally save lives, help us through the worst moments we may ever experience, and can impact the quality of the rest of our lives forever.

About a month ago I met someone online who has been going through some serious mental stuff. It seems like I'm the first person they feel safe talking to and it really sucks for me to see them going through breakdowns online where I feel like I can't be there for them. They live very far north so it's not easy for me to see them either. However, I feel like now more than ever they need someone to talk to and someone to comfort them, especially as they don't feel comfortable talking about their problems around their parents (part of the cause), and thus they don't often want to talk about it in a call. I don't want to break social distancing, but I feel like in this case it might be worth the risk to stay in a hostel and meet them in person. However because they are a logical person I don't think that even if I thought it was right, I could convince them to breach lockdown to see me. What should I do?

Hi, just a bit of advice pls. I’ve experienced episodes of anxiety lasting a few months since I was sixteen. Up until recently, I felt like I was in a good place and reasonably well. However over lockdown, my mum and dad have been pressuring me about my plans for after graduation almost every day, and (in short) suggest that the only way for me to be successful in life is to graduate, move away from my long- term partner and all friends and go into any career that makes a lot of money (regardless of my interests). I fear this is bringing on another episode, especially as my partner and friends form a big part of my support system. Of course I understand they want the best future for me, and I too I want to be financially secure and stable, but this intense pressure I’m feeling currently is really stressing me out. Any help/ advice?

Am I wrong to be upset at the addition of black and brown stripes into the pride flag? I am a gay man who struggled INTENSELY with coming out and having a dedicated and respected flag to represent the community I was part of made it feel like I have a proper established community. The rainbow flag is solely a flag to represent LGBTQI+ people and their fight concerning gender and sexual equality, it is not a flag to represent race. No one is demeaning the additional struggles of black and brown LGBTQI+ people, but they are RACIAL troubles and not specifically LGBTQI+. You wouldn’t add black and brown stripes to the Union Jack because there are black and brown Britons; the Union Jack represents ALL British people just as the pride flag represents all GAY people, not just white

Confession time. So my flat mate kept stealing my tea bags - proper nice pukka tea as well. It was really starting to get on my nerves so I decided it was time to take action. I started offering to make their tea, since they always had it in the evening this was pretty easy to do and I'm sure they thought I was just being nice. So every evening I'd wait to go to the loo till exactly 8pm when they liked their tea, take their mug, and piss in it. One quick trip to the microwave and a bit of watering down and as far as they could tell it was just a new flavour of tea - one that went down surprisingly well I might add.

How do I tell my girlfriend that she is definitely punching above her weight being with me...? Like not to sound cocky or anything but I am definitely a lot hotter than her and my past girlfriends have been significantly hotter (for reference I dated a Victoria secret model). I have also modelled for various brands (I met my other ex on a Calvin Klein shoot). She seems to think that by constantly saying that I’m the one punching I will eventually believe it? She says it all the time. For example at parties she will go around to everyone asking who’s better looking and the majority say her (bc she’s the one asking and they’re her friends ahahah ) and then comes and reports back? I don’t want to sound rude like I’m calling her ugly. But I fell for her personality... which right now is jarring on me soley for this reason. We had been friends for years and I didn’t have that attraction but I love her personality. I would never want to make her insecure about her looks but she’s pissing me off. She doesn’t go to this uni so luckily her and her friends won’t see it because it would be blaringly obvious it is me writing this.
How do I politely tell my gf that she ain’t that good looking and no where near my league. If I’m the champions league, she is league one.

Hi brumfess, incoming rant warning! Just want to get something off my chest - sorry for the negativity :(
It really rubs me up the wrong way when someone messages me saying things like “ugh. I’m so gutted” or “fgs” just randomly. They then expect me to ask them what’s wrong and probably give advice, too. There’s no “hi”, no “hey, is it ok if I have a bit of a rant”, no option for me to not engage with said rant - they just dive right in with their attention grabbing tactics. I understand wanting to let off steam to a friend but holy shit at least say hello first? I get it from all sides and nobody seems to care about how that’s affecting my mental health. All people want to do is whinge at me and expect me to give all my energy to their problems. Like honestly there’s only so much I can suggest when you’re complaining that your siblings are lazy and your house is a mess and it’s just the same problems over and over again and you’re shutting down my suggestions anyway. I’m sick of hearing it all the time instead of being able to have a good time with them.

Rant over. Have a great day :)

The carbon monoxide alarm our landlord gave us is completely terrible. We have had to remove the batteries because it keeps making extremely loud sounds all the time.
We even tried replacing the batteries with new ones so the noise would stop (like with fire alarms when battery running low).
Can anyone recommend a good one they have in their houses?

If you think the gender pay gap doesn’t exist
- you’re denying very clear and evident statistics that prove otherwise - literally just google it and do some research.
- If you think the pay gap only exists because of childcare / motherhood and the restrictions this has on women’s ability to go to work - this may be valid to an extent - but what does it say about traditionally “feminine” gender roles (being the primary care giver), and not having a choice but to take time off work when pregnant? Yes, women will have to have time off work to give birth (obviously) but why should childbirth and care dictate a difference in wages???? Men also ‘choose’ to have children but the impact on their careers is virtually non existent.
- If you think the pay gap exists because men are more ambitious at school and are ready to take up higher paying roles, ask yourself why women might be less academically driven in school? What’s it like to have expectations set lower for your because of your gender, and to sit in a classroom and expect your voice to be valued less than male peers? Of course this is going to impact educational prospects.
- If you’re a white, cis, het, fella, who still denies the wage gap you need to check your privilege. It is not your place to say whether women do or don’t experience a wage gap- you’re never going to experience it, or any cultural factors that contribute to it!! The evidence is there, it’s not for you to comment on, do your research, use your privilege and bloody do something to change it.
We shouldn’t need a flood of brumfesses to explain this, Google’s a thing. If you’re gonna make a big (and frankly offensive) claim like that, do the research first please.

Over the past year or so I've had four friends ghost me for no reason, and it's really fucked with me. All of them were really good friends who I talked to almost daily, and going from that to ignoring my messages and acting like I don't exist has just crushed me. I asked multiple times if I'd done something wrong but just got ignored, and to the best of my knowledge I've not done anything. So now I have multiple breakdowns every week, my depression and anxiety are awful, I've since struggled to form new friendships, and I don't think I'll be able to go back to the clubs I knew a couple of them from because they'll be there. Thanks, great friends you were.

Question regarding the bra debate: I've been wearing 30A bras for a very long time (5-6 years now) and they fit... but when I now calculate my bra size it says I'm a 32C or sometimes D which really confuses me. I really don't have big boobs (or so I thought). Now I'm confused about what bra size I should buy (have been for almost half a year now). I sort of want to do a bra fitting somewhere but 1) I am very insecure about my body 2) I can't afford the places that offer them.

If I saw a woman getting sexually harassed on the street I would stop it like most fucking men omg, you think most men would let that happen? You do realise every man has a mum so only the fucked up ones are gonna want to cause harm to women. I dont know what part of the UK you're from but obviously a fucked up one.
Calling all men trash because some men sexually assault women is like calling all muslims terrorists because of isis and all women slags because of kim Kardashian.
If you think most men are ok with sexual assault/rape you are seriously deluded or I suggest you change the men you hang around with because you obviously attract a bad crowd.

Neither my sister nor I could sleep so my angel of a mum took the sofa and let my sister and I sleep in her double bed. Let me tell you, it was the worst night of my life. My sister was tossing and turning all night. She breathed too loud. And she only went and farted on me didn’t she 🤢

TW: suicide
.
Statistics show that while men do succeed in committing suicide at a higher rate than women, women attempt suicide 2-4 times more than men, and have more frequent suicidal thoughts.
All the statistics show is that men are more likely to succeed in committing suicide which is attributed to them using more lethal methods, but if you look at all the statistics in the wider picture they show that women are suffering just as much in this respect.
So I ask that you don’t use male suicide rates in arguments to take away from what other people are saying, to prove that men have it worse, or whatever your point is.

My girlfriend started researching star signs and horoscopes at the beginning of lockdown, and now is completely obsessed. I ask her to do things and she responds with excuses regarding her horoscope, ‘I don’t want to start looking for a flat together because it’s hard for me to deal with change at the moment’ kind of excuses. She even said to me that she was waiting for when the moon was at it’s strongest (or something like that) to submit her masters application (I suppose she thinks she is more likely to get accepted?). I have never believed in astrology so at first I just let her get on with it, and didn’t pay much attention. She then started asking me for my place of birth and time of birth so she could make my ‘chart’ I thought this was strange at the time but I thought it would make her happy so gave it to her. All of her dumb excuses began to annoy me, so I told her that I thought astrology was stupid and she should stop listening to it, to which she responded ‘I knew this was going to happen’ I pressed her on what she meant, and she said that she had compared our birth charts and seen we were not compatible. I was so angry at her, it felt like an invasion of privacy and it also felt like she had been looking for an excuse to break up? We had an argument over it and I made her promise not to look at my horoscope again, we then made up and life went on as usual. Today, I have realised that she messaged her ex boyfriend to find out his birth place and time too. Now this ex is still a mutual friend of ours, and it has never been awkward that we’re now all friends even though they dated in the past, but I feel so angry that she is still looking into this shit psuedo science? Surely the only reason she would want to know his chart is to compare their comparability too? I don’t want to break up with her but this is seriously getting to me. She seems to compare more about what the stars think about her life than what I think.

I was giving a blowjob once and accidentally threw up on the guy. It was in the dark and only a little bit so I wiped it up with my hand and pretended I needed the bathroom to go wash the vomit off my hands.
I don’t think the dude ever noticed

I am Hindu, I have lived in India and in the UK and let me be clear, I have not yet met a single Hindu (north / south, savarna / non savarna, practicing / non practicing) who holds the swastika in such close regard as some of you guys seem to be.
Let us be completely honest about what is going on here. We are pissed that one of our symbols was appropriated by the N*zis. I get it. Trust me, I do. Our traditions are more that just ""not-Christian"", they are non western. Our traditions are full of iconography and spirituality that have been everything:
(a) a subject of immense curiosity for Western academics who love to explain our culture to us
(b) fodder for multinationals to appropriate and print on clothing, using child labour from the very countries that they steal the iconography from
(c) a way for festival goers to look cool while we watched our hardworking mothers get mocked for wearing the same fashion on the high street
(d) held in association with drug use and vagrancy
(e) something that most of us got mocked for everyday growing up
I take so much pride in being Hindu, and yet carry so much pain from everything I said above, and more. So naturally a public rejection of the swastika (which is everywhere in our texts) feels like an addition to the list of indignities I mentioned above. But it isn't. The removal of the swastika from public spaces is a specific request from a heavily persecuted minority that fights against misconceptions and mistrust on a daily basis (you'd think we'd be empathetic to that...) When I go to India, I see it everywhere, and I don't mind. Because here's the difference: the politics of WW2 informs a collective historical trauma that communities living in this part of world feel everyday. India does not have that specific trauma. So, for as long as that holds, different rules for different places. Deal with it.
And while it is everywhere in published text, let's not pretend that looking at one makes you feel closer to god because that is not how it is supposed to work anyway. But if you do need to express you religion and spirituality though Hindu icons: use the lingam, use om, use shree, we're not lacking for meaningful symbols.
""But it was ours first"" isn't good enough of a fucking argument. It isn't about whose it was first. The salute wasn't an original N*zi idea either, you know. ""But it's the other way around"" isn't good enough. The purpose of a symbol is to convey an idea in an instant. If you are carrying around and parading a symbol that needs ""thought"" and ""analysis"" before being understood, it's an ineffective symbol. And if 90% people on first glance are going to associate it with one of the worst acts of genocide in recent history, you really have to confront yourself about what hill you've chosen to die on. It is tone deaf at best. And callous, cruel and an unnecessary flex of how cool you are at worst.

Buckle up boys and girls as this is something I'm not (kinda am) proud of and have been meaning to share for some time.
This begins simply as a classic tale of an unwanted Christmas gift. In my first year at uni, I had got into baking as a way to bond with flatmates/friends and I had regularly been sending pictures of my creations in the family group chat. My siblings didn't care much, but my parents were glad I had found a new hobby.
Then one fateful November day, I decided to make a raspberry ripple cake. I went the whole 9 yards, raspberry coulis swirled throughout, freeze-dried raspberries on top, flavoured icing, all of it. My parents were astounded when I sent them a picture, and were very proud. One of my flatmates, however, told me it was stupid to spend this much time over something you would just eat and I should be studying instead. I ate the cake in a meloncholic state - happy for my parental approval but annoyed my flatmate was being such a dick about this.
Fast forward to Christmas day, the whole family is home and it's going swimmingly. It's my turn to open a present and out pops a freeze-drier. Understandably, I was a bit confused. ""You're now into baking and we just loved seeing the raspberry ripple cake you made. This way you can freeze-dry your own fruit and experiment with new flavours!"" My mum said this proudly, and you've got to hand it to them, it was a sweet but odd present. Now you may not be aware, but these are pricy bits of kit. So I put on a brave face, said thanks and we moved on.
Back at uni, and my parents insisted I took my new but of kit with me. I relented and put it in the shared kitchen as a sort of talking point, never really planning to use it. The flatmate I hated noticed it, gave me lots of grief for it and even told me I wasn't the favourite child if that was what my parents got me. She then sauntered off looking proud of her destruction of my happiness.
Now to really understand why I then did what I did, let me tell you more about this girl. She was an aspiring VSCO girl; she posted her whole life on social media, was way too loud at all hours of the day, said stupid phrases that none of us understood and fatefully had a coffee machine where you had to grind your own beans (she said my freeze-drier took up too much room in the kitchen even though she had this). Realising this, I hatched my plan.
One night when the flat was empty (this flatmate had convinced everyone else to go to some shit night out), I started my work. Firstly, I took a decent sized poo in my freeze-drier and set it going. A few hours later, I was left with a lovely brown powder that was not too dissimilar to ground coffee. I then put this underneath the beans in her coffee machine, so the next cup of Joe would actually be a cup of poo (kinda rhymes).
Cue the hungover next day, and this flatmate is up at 11, just hankering for a caffeine hit. I'm in the kitchen baking away (scones if you must know) so I get to see it all play out. She makes her cup of coffee, and takes that first, vengeful sip. I wait with baited breath to witness her reaction.... And there is none. ""Ah, lovely and earthy. See that's why you but the more expensive beans"" she comments. She heads back to bed whilst I pick my jaw up off the floor.
I'm astounded. My bitch of a flatmate just drank my own shit and DID NOT REALISE. Even enjoyed it! I'm not proud to say, but for the rest of the year, whenever I got the chance, I would top up her machine with my ""earthy"" tasting poo, and she was none the wiser.
And that, concludes my tale. I've never told anyone this, but with virtual graduation (woop) just around the corner, I thought this had to be shared. Stay safe hombres, and never, ever piss off a flatmate with a freeze-drier.

Buckle up boys and girls as this is something I'm not (kinda am) proud of and have been meaning to share for some time.
This begins simply as a classic tale of an unwanted Christmas gift. In my first year at uni, I had got into baking as a way to bond with flatmates/friends and I had regularly been sending pictures of my creations in the family group chat. My siblings didn't care much, but my parents were glad I had found a new hobby.
Then one fateful November day, I decided to make a raspberry ripple cake. I went the whole 9 yards, raspberry coulis swirled throughout, freeze-dried raspberries on top, flavoured icing, all of it. My parents were astounded when I sent them a picture, and were very proud. One of my flatmates, however, told me it was stupid to spend this much time over something you would just eat and I should be studying instead. I ate the cake in a meloncholic state - happy for my parental approval but annoyed my flatmate was being such a dick about this.
Fast forward to Christmas day, the whole family is home and it's going swimmingly. It's my turn to open a present and out pops a freeze-drier. Understandably, I was a bit confused. ""You're now into baking and we just loved seeing the raspberry ripple cake you made. This way you can freeze-dry your own fruit and experiment with new flavours!"" My mum said this proudly, and you've got to hand it to them, it was a sweet but odd present. Now you may not be aware, but these are pricy bits of kit. So I put on a brave face, said thanks and we moved on.
Back at uni, and my parents insisted I took my new but of kit with me. I relented and put it in the shared kitchen as a sort of talking point, never really planning to use it. The flatmate I hated noticed it, gave me lots of grief for it and even told me I wasn't the favourite child if that was what my parents got me. She then sauntered off looking proud of her destruction of my happiness.
Now to really understand why I then did what I did, let me tell you more about this girl. She was an aspiring VSCO girl; she posted her whole life on social media, was way too loud at all hours of the day, said stupid phrases that none of us understood and fatefully had a coffee machine where you had to grind your own beans (she said my freeze-drier took up too much room in the kitchen even though she had this). Realising this, I hatched my plan.
One night when the flat was empty (this flatmate had convinced everyone else to go to some shit night out), I started my work. Firstly, I took a decent sized poo in my freeze-drier and set it going. A few hours later, I was left with a lovely brown powder that was not too dissimilar to ground coffee.

Shoutout to the ""alpha males"" on tiv who thought it would be a good idea to go out on the street and cause a scene.
Please learn to handle your drink. If you can't control yourself after drinking then don't do it.
Crying and screaming at each other on the street also isn't the smartest thing to do. I don't know who you were trying to impress but everyone looked disgusted. If you are going to have a fight then fight and don't be a little birch screaming on the street and pushing each other. You're not bad so don't try to act all tough when your actions clearly don't reflect what you were saying. Shouting that you will knock each other out on the street when in reality you were just pushing each other like kids in a playground.
Girls don't find that shit attractive, its the most off-putting thing you could do. Grow some balls and learn to handle a few drinks you muppets.

I wouldn't say anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitic... but it is a very good indicator of antisemitism. When people boycott and campaign against Israel, despite the fact that most of the surrounding countries are brutal dictatorships that execute LGBT people and oppress women, there's something not quite right. Why would you choose to be opposed to the right of the only Jewish nation on Earth to exist? There's no other case where people deny a country's right to exist based on decisions made by the government. Nobody says ""I don't like the circumstances that this country was created under, so I think they should leave and give up their independence"". Many countries were created through genocide and invasion. Israel was created by people ESCAPING from genocide and yet people continue to use historical arguments against their existence. I encourage everyone to visit Israel and see for yourself what the country is like!

I used to be what many would consider a 'nice guy'. When I was in school I'd form massive crushes on girls and all I knew how to do was be nice to them, that's pretty much all they had done to me. And I kept getting rejected or having things not work out over and over again. I hated it. Not because I thought I was nice to the girls and I deserved their bodies, but it was more a longing for connection and intimacy. I see now how just being nice will rarely lead to anything more than a friendship, but I was a anxious, socially awkward teenager who had no idea how to flirt.
Nice guys are demonized so much, but most of them likely suffer from anxiety or a similar mental issue, maybe instead of saying they are just bad and attacking them, help them out. Personally I had to turn to a self help book about the issue, which was definitely helpful at the time.
If I had a message to nice guys it would be that you should try and demonstrate some of your other qualities, of which you will have many. Pursue interests you are passionate about, be polarizing about issues you care about, and don't spend your life craving a woman's validation.

I smoked a lot of weed in the past, I drink alcohol and I used to be a smoker and now I’m a social smoker and I think all of these should be illegal. Okay, maybe not illegal, but people shouldn’t be able to consume large amounts of them and they shouldn’t be able to consume them often so they don’t get addicted. I get that weed has medical uses, but all of these substances are SO harmful if consumed irresponsibly, and loads of people consume them irresponsibly.
The problem is, there’s no way this could be enforced. If that were the case, it would also be lovely if you had to take a course and pass an exam to become a parent, and I have fab ideas for other restrictions as well. People are idiots and society needs some fucking rules.
Also, 🌸 weed has no negative effects hun 🌸 IS SUCH BULLSHIT. It kills your motivation which can lead to loads of issues and it can cause a decrease in your IQ. It also causes severe anxiety and panic very often, that was one of the reasons I stopped - and I ended up developing an anxiety disorder, which I’m sure the weed contributed to. I also had a close friend who was extremely motivated and smart, went to Cambridge, started smoking weed more and more often and he ended up doing absolutely nothing for the 3 years he was there, his relationship fell apart and he barely passed his course, he has no career prospects basically. I also saw it being a gateway drug for countless people. I know these all sound ridiculous, as if you were sitting at a mandatory secondary school “this is why drugs are bad” presentation, but I saw all of these happening to several people I am/was pretty close to.
Also shoutout to my idiot first year flatmates who constantly smoked weed in our kitchen to the point where it became unbearable and then made a huge deal out of security coming in once to tell them off - no, I wasn’t the one who called them but it was fully deserved lmao. Don’t want to smell that every fucking morning while drinking my coffee guys.

It's weird seeing so many people who have had negative experiences with the University Medical Practice as I have thought for a long time that maybe my experience was unique, but it looks like maybe it wasn't. Also seen people specifically referring to a female doctor and maybe I'm putting two and two together a bit to quickly but could it be the same doctor that is treating people this way?

I’ve never been on a date with someone I don’t know...
I’ve slept with over 100 people
And I’ve never had a boyfriend although I’ve been messed around by one boy for about a year and a half, who expected me to act like we were in a relationship but slept with other girls weekly and asked girls out in front of me...
I guess I’m told I’m very pretty almost every time I leave the house, although if I really was I probably wouldn’t be single and only good enough to shag?
Anyway if anyone who’s genuinely nice wants to take me on a date and doesn’t think I’m a freak from what I’ve just said, I’d really like to :))) I only just realised I’m quite old to never have had more than what I have had....

This isn't meant to be offensive at all, just want to put that out there before anyone comes for me in the comments I'm genuinely asking/looking for advice!
Recently broke up with my gf of 5 years, and in my new single horny state (and partly to give my hand a break oops) I've started questioning whether I'm also attracted to guys as well as girls? I was with her pretty much since the earliest I could have sex legally so I've never given it much thought before, but now I'm wondering and in my wondering I was thinking about the.... mechanics of man and man sex. Specifically, I have three questions I would appreciate being answered either in comments or followup posts (completely understand the need for anonymity!!!)
1. Without labelling myself as bi or gay, am I allowed to go onto grindr? If yes, how do I label myself as a top or bottom if I haven't done anything yet, how will I know?
2. For BOTTOMS: what do you get out of sex? By sex I mean, sex sex. Without getting too detailed, where is the pleasure derived from in your viewpoint? Just the fulfilling of another mans needs or is there the opportunity for more?
3. For TOPS: Do you ever worry about causing pain to the Bottom in a nonBDSM way? Of course if that's your thing then go ahead, but in a vanilla setting is that a worry?
Thank you UoB gay and men who enjoy sex with men! And if anyone is up for helping me choose some labels, like this comment! Practical experiments may be involved, I am a lab tech after all!! TIA

I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about anxiety and I want to help as best I can so here are some things that have helped me:
1) whatever you do don’t isolate yourself, I know it feels like a good idea or you don’t want to bother people but trust me they would much rather help than later found out you were struggling and that they could have been there for you.
2) call someone or message someone to come over, I don’t mean you have to talk or say anything to them, because I understand sometimes your throat closes up and it’s hard to breathe or talk but let them be there and tell you about their day or give you a hug and believe me you’ll relax a lot faster than on your own.
3) I know that it’s easy to get stuck in a cycle of panic and feeling helpless that’s almost impossible to break, but try to tell yourself solutions, they may not be immediate but you’ll see it’s not a clear cut road but that there is always a solution
Stay safe selly and if anyone wants to talk I’m here

TW: anxiety, mental health
How do I get from understanding that most of my anxieties are illogical, to actually not feeling anxious about them anymore? Like I know they're ridiculous, and I can reel off all the reasons why to myself, but I can't stop the feelings or the thoughts.
Going back on medication soon, as it's been good for me in the past, but just wondered if anyone else has any pointers beyond the normal self-care and talking to people stuff I'm already doing?

About a year ago I made the mistake of telling a group of lads that I didn’t want to have children and I didn’t want to get married.
They looked at me like I was an alien, as though what I said was some kind of blasphemy. Some asked “What?” some “Why?” until one took pity on me and said “you can’t ask her that, she may have personal reasons...”
I had to laugh. My personal reason is that I simply don’t want to. Not because I am medically incapable.
I don’t have to have something wrong with me to not want to have children. And just because I am a woman does not mean that inevitably I will get married or that I want to assume a traditional family role.
Normalise this view! Stop looking at women as though we are ill in the head for not wanting to take your last name or for not wanting to put our bodies through the experience of having a child! We are not all the same and procreation is not our sole purpose!
Let me live my life without your traditionalist conservative (small c) judgment.
And while I’m at it, free the fucken nipple.

Agreeing a bit with #Brumfess40551
I do think it is a bit ridiculous that I know people who have got into uni with grades like DDE at A-Level. I also know I didn’t put any where near as much work in as they recommend throughout the three years and I’m graduating with a 2:1. Both of these things point to the fact that uni is easier these days, therefore making degrees seem a bit worthless when applying to jobs as so many people have them (again obviously subject dependent).
I think we as a society need to emphasise apprenticeships and going straight into work after leaving school instead of promoting uni to everyone no matter your level of academics.

For those struggling to get deposits back from Oakmans!
After following their instructions and detailing all the problems of our house in the inventory we were surprised to find that we were being charged for Blue tac marks left by a previous tenant. Of course we appealed and asked them to look at the specific reference on our inventory. They then emailed denying the reference stated Blue tac marks.
I had to call them (despite their emails saying that we shouldn’t call the office) to sort this out. On the call the agent got very aggressive, stating that we didn’t fill the inventory in right. It turns out they read it wrong! They were reading the original inventory rather than the check in amendments on the last page.
Just a heads up to everyone to double check their inventory, make sure you complete the check in amendments and be sure that Oakmans know how to actually read their own documents ! Could save you a lot of money 💰

I think I'm turning into a hypochondriac 😭 I have no symptoms but I have three different medical appointments lined up just to check if everything is okay and I have to stop myself from signing up for more. I'm so anxious all the time.
Currently, the thing that worries me the most is that I had unprotected oral sex with a friend back in March and although he said he was clean and I trusted him, I feel paranoid now. I'm not from the UK, and in my country, STI tests cost a lot and I'm not sure I can afford it until autumn. But what if by then there won't be any check-ups because of COVID? I don't know what to do. Should I use up all my money or is it fine to wait if I don't have symptoms?

If only I could find myself a man like that!

Why are Brits so Americanised? Half of you are starting to put the month before the day as in 'July 18th' not '18th july', most of you use American rather than British words, your grammar is often more consistent with American English and it feels like you have no concern for your own culture. I just thought that was a shame.
'Half' of you voted for Brexit to 'take your country back' but Europe isnt the one taking your country's culture & traditions. America has well and truly misled you

Yo, so I want to do a separate masters after my degree and obvs the postgraduate loan baso just covers fees. I'm working a job atm which I thought I would save up to afford to do my masters but my parents have offered to cover the cost of living even though my dad might lose his job. I'm worried that they'll put themselves out just for me to do a masters but they won'tet me pay for it and are adamant that I should save the money I earn for a house in the future. What should I do?
Also I know I am incredibly privileged to have this kind of parental support and this isn't me moaning about them wanting to support me, I just dont want them to get into financial difficulties. Looking at postgraduate study has made me realise just how inaccessible it is to students from lower income backgrounds and to those that don't have this kind of support and has helped me to be a lot more grateful of the support I do have.

I can’t stand living with my family. My mum has this tendency to suddenly turn spiteful out of seemingly nowhere. Almost like this toddler-like strop where if she doesn’t get her own way, instead of saying there’s a problem, she’ll throw below the belt insults at you and then refuse to see why it’s not okay.
I literally never get angry but once she starts, I’m very reactive. I shouldn’t have to calmly explain to a grown woman why she shouldn’t accuse me of being ‘not right’ or ‘having something wrong with me’ because I do something minor like leave a cup on the side.

Right so I’m fairly confident that come September/October we should be able to return to 90% normality!
Literally every week more science comes to light about this virus and it’s becoming more and more clear that it’s not as serious as was first thought!!
Up to 80% of people who have the virus are asymptomatic, and as the science is telling us more and more that asymptomatic cases don’t pass the virus on very much at all!!
Again up to 80% of people have these T-cells or “immunological dark matter” that is protecting them from catching the virus!
The number of cases and deaths are falling steadily week on week, as to are the number of 111 calls and hospital admissions, people on ventilators, it’s all heading in the right direction! (Would like to remind people that now we are getting closer to wiping out the virus, there is going to be more fluctuation so important to look at trends not figures)
The number of people dying in hospitals is now 1.5% . At the peak it was 6% so it’s now 4x less likely you will die of this disease in hospital! Community transmission is falling to so less of the disease is getting into care homes and to other vulnerable households!
More drugs are becoming available to treat the virus, remdesivir and the new one, hydroxychloroquine, Cuts the death rate of people needing oxygen by a third!!
And of course a vaccine could be ready by October and good progress is being made, so I see no reason by 2021 we will be through this!!
So yeah it’s defo the right time to be relaxing lockdown and as long as people keep sticking to the rules then we will have relative normality by the new term!!

There's a blonde middle aged woman I keep seeing along Bristol road, every time I make eye contact with her she seems to want to say something but I never let her.

There's a blonde middle aged woman I keep seeing along Bristol road, every time I make eye contact with her she seems to want to say something but I never let her. But when I try to walk away/show her I'm busy/pretend that I'm on the phone, she follows me for a good twenty/thirty meters. Am I wrong for trying to ignore her?

I don’t know if I have autism or anxiety or what but I have massive issues with noise. I get really anxious and distressed at continuous noise, particularly at night, and I don’t know why. Obviously if someone’s playing loud music it’s difficult, but even the sound of someone watching TV or talking, even if it’s not very loud, makes me really upset. Basically if there’s a continuous noise I suddenly feel really claustrophobic and it feels like the walls are closing in on me, and I have this need to make it stop so I’ll do things like start hitting myself really hard or crying. I can’t explain what it is about the noise, I just get distressed for no reason. This has had a big impact on how I get along with my housemates, as I try and explain I need them to be quiet but because I don’t know how to say how it feels or I can’t say I’ve got something wrong that specifically makes it worse, I don’t know what to do.

Can people please stop invalidating over peoples degrees!
STEM subjects are important. Arts are important. Medicine is important. Law is important. Social sciences are important. All degrees are important.
Everyone had to work so hard to get into university from different situations of quality of teaching and family support and income. And we’re all in the same university investing in ourselves. We are all dedicating our education to a certain field that suits our learning, our individual skills and for a career for ourselves. Just because you may not value the skills or work that goes into a certain degree does not mean it’s not important.
Stop invalidating subjects to boost your egos.

I sttayed in Selly during the lockdown and am finally moving back home tomorrow. Don't get me wrong, there have been points where being away from home and seeing all my friends with their families and in the comfort of their family home was so difficult, but overall I have kind of enjoyed being in here these past few months. Selly was so quiet, I felt safe, and there was a weirdly peaceful atmosphere.
That's why seeing all the people who pissed off home in March and come back over the past couple of weeks has made my blood boil. The streets on a night sound like just another sports night.
We. Are. Still. In. A. Pandemic.
And even if we weren't in a pandemic, it's made me think so much more about the local community who have to deal with the noise and the mess of students all year round. I am gutted to be finishing uni, but I'm also so relieved that I don't have to spend another year in Selly seeing people treat the place like a fucking zoo.

TW sexual assault
.
.
.
.

All of my sexual encounters have been when I have been blackout drunk, and most I barely even remember. When I think of seeing any of those guys again I feel scared and don’t want to see them - one of which was in one of my seminars - and I felt uncomfortable when I was around them. I know consent wise someone who is blackout drunk cannot consent, but also I don’t feel like it is assault? Because it’s not like I didn’t want to have sex? And they were drunk too... but recently I’ve been thinking of my pervious sexual experiences (quarantine got us all a bit more obsessed with sex) and I feel like I’ve not had a good experience, and honestly I don’t think I could have sex with anyone unless I was really drunk. Is this normal to feel?

If someone has more info on this please let me know, but this is my idea for corona control: why hasn't the aim been to focus specifically on protecting the vulnerable? This has especially been brought to my mind because shielding guidance is being eased despite the fact that the risk is now at its highest due to everything opening up again. The government could have spent this lockdown formulating plans to increase the safety for the elderly and immuno-compromised. Then, when lockdown is eased as it is now, we could observe whether the number of cases amongst the elderly stays low and whether the death rate goes down - if the protections for the vulnerable are effective we should see the the case numbers rise amongst healthy people but the deaths stay very low. This way, we could build up to reopening the whole country and even eventually lifting social distancing entirely.
The problem with the current lockdown solution is that, yeah we lowered cases during lockdown, but even as we've seen with New Zealand, Corona will inevitably rear its head again. There is no permanent solution in place and it seems other than gambling on a vaccine the government has absolutely no long-term solution in mind and is fine to gamble with public safety in favour of economic benefits by easing lockdown. Obviously Boris' initial suggestion for herd immunity by basically doing nothing was incredibly stupid, but with the method I've described above, we'd see more people catching and surviving the virus, which would lead to less overall spread to the people who are at risk of complications.
Instead of throwing money at the government's embarassing attempt at a track and trace app and service, this money could have gone to hospitals, care homes, and carers, to ensure that the vulnerable are protected the best they can be, and also so that the rest of the country could begin to get back to normal. Again if someone has any more info on whether this would/wouldn't work I would love to hear it. Thanks for reading x

Unpopular opinion?
You may be within your rights to fully recline your seat on an aeroplane, but fully doing so without asking first is such a dick move. Especially if the first thing you do when the seat belt light goes off is throw your seat back into my knees. Obviously I think everyone needs to recline a little but we do not need to go 8 hours with your head in my lap. This is especially the case when the row behind you can't recline because they're at the back and, like a human being, you don't recline fully into them out of respect.
Planes are miserable enough as it is, why can't we show a little human decency and at least ask before ramming our seats into someone else's knees? Maybe even reach a compromise and recline half way? If you want to act like an entitled piece of shit, at least have the courtesy to pay for business or first class where your lack of empathy affects fewer people.
Other aeroplane rants that I don't have to worry about for a while (cheers Rona) include not being a dick to flight attendents (were only some of us taught please and thank you?) and standing up as soon as the plane lands. We still have to taxi and join up to arrivals you dense twat. Finally, if you spend your entire flight fingering your girlfriend right next to me, please don't ask to borrow my pen to fill out the ""nothing to declare form"". I will either refuse or insist you do not give me my pen back. wHo RaIsEd YoU?

Btw anyone that went to the south coast over the last few days should be ashamed of themselves. Not only has it risked a second spike, but people’s behaviour is absolutely disgusting. Why do people think it’s acceptable to urinate in others’ gardens, spit at traffic wardens when they say the car parks full and leave over 33 tonnes of litter on the beach that locals spent the early hours this morning picking up.

one week ago my grandfather died due to covid, one week ago my grandmother died indirectly due to covid (from no cancer treatment since march). you do not need to know the ugly details of the past month of their lives and the close family trying to keep them alive, but it was hard.
planning a funeral in this climate is disgusting, you cannot grieve properly, you cannot hug the ones you love from other households in an attempt to help make it a little easier.
it hurts that i view people’s snapchat and instagram stories of them skin to skin with their friends, too close not thinking, in packed parks and streets. none of these people have considered the flip side. what i would give to be able to have one hug from my partner to help me just a little. what i would give to have the ability to walk among the crowds without fear and thought. there is this common thought among the population that ‘it’ll happen to someone who else’.
some would argue, ‘just do it, everyone else has’ or ‘lockdown is over’ but when you’ve had to go through the tourture of covid and it’s effects on not only the infected but the families of these loved ones. honestly, I wouldn’t wish the pain on my worst enemy.
please try to consider that it’s not about you, you might be alright, but those in the older or vulnerable will not. i can not fathom the selfishness that is so potent in society today. i know that many will not read this, i know many have already rolled their eyes and continued their day. i just want to try and reach someone. please step into someone else’s shoes and think. it isn’t over yet.
how would you feel burring a member of your close family, with your relatives spread apart in an empty hall, knowing your last hug with them was over 4 months ago and there was no goodbye?

People who think students that went to private schools have a head start in life have obviously never met the average person from a private school. They literally get taught the exact same curriculum as state schools. Also every person I’ve met that went to private school was completely normal and you wouldn’t even notice if it came up. Stop stigmatising people because of where their parents sent them to school. Yeah there are some bad people that come out of private school, but FYI there’s some bad people that come out of state school. In fact a friend of mine who never spoke about money etc and went to private school ended up getting bullied by someone from state school because she didn’t speak posh enough. You really cannot generalise someone by their education, it’s incredibly backwards. Whenever people from private school call us state school kids “chavs” or anything else we kick off and say it’s out of order but calling them posh twats or tories without knowing them is absolutely fine??? I just don’t get why our generation is so obsessed with causing divides between people and fuelling a class war.

I was wondering if anyone is having problems with Octopus energy? I’ve finalised a 12 month contract for my new house but now I’ve got an email saying I’ve received an objection to my transfer from the previous energy supplier?? They said it may be due to an outstanding balance with my old supplier and that I may have to agree to a payment plan or that I owe them energy used my previous tenants and need to open a temporary account? I’m really really confused about all of this, has anyone had this issue before and knows what to do?

I have given my best suggestions to help her, and she won’t see a professional. She dismisses all the options. I want to be there for her, but I honestly don’t have the time or the energy to be the soundboard for how shit her life is. I’m not trained for this and there’s nothing more I can say! It sounds heartless, but I want to be her friend and not her therapist.

I think in light of pretty much everyone missing the point of my naughty dog rant in #Brumfess37136 I should clear a few things up.
I have no issue at all with strong female characters in any media and I think that the female writers responsible for the female characters did a great job, given they are female you'd expect them to probably know best on the topic of writing female characters.
What I take issue with is a man removing the real women who wrote the characters from their job, and then going on to create far inferior and less believable female characters that do not do justice to what a strong female character should look like.
My argument is against the man who cannot write female characters, but thought he could do better than the women already doing an outstanding job of it.

To the guy in the comments who listed (in amongst a bunch of other bad things he hoped to happen to the rapist) that he hoped the guy was single for the rest of his life with no kids, I can't even begin to tell you how dangerous this attitude to singleness is. Being single is not a bad thing. A person is not less fulfilled because they are single and to speak about it as such a damning situation for a person's life contributes to situations like the poor girl who was raped by her bf because she lives in a society where the prospect of singleness is so damn awful to even think about that she would struggle to gain the courage to leave such an awful man and recognise her self worth.

I should have just not gone to uni, read some legal cases on Wikipedia for a few hours because after all it doesn't take 3 years+ to learn everything legal in detail, shown up at the Clifford Chance headquarters and asked for a job with absolutely no qualification to show that I have a critical understanding of the law. I'm sure they would have hired me on the spot!

I'm strongly pro choice. I believe a woman has the right to choose what happens with her body. However, I also don't think pro life people should be considered evil. These people have been deluded by religion into thinking abortion is literally murder. To them, campaigning against abortion is the same as campaigning for murder to be banned. They genuinely care about ""unborn children"", which you'd know if you talked to them. It's not some kind of conspiracy to remove women's rights. Maybe instead of hurling insults at these people, we should allow them to express their opinions and engage with them politely. They will never change their views unless we talk to them.

NOSE PIERCINGS!! ON NON AFRICANS? CULTURAL APPROPRIATION? BLM is arguably more important rn than a lot of less intense racism that other non-white cultures face.
But you could easily have researched this! It’s so incredibly offensive you don’t know how far back nose piercings apply to south Asian culture, religion and community.
I will not be accused of cultural appropriation for embracing the piercing that my mother, grandmothers and great grandmothers all wore as part of their womanhood and marriage ceremonies!
Your post seems harmless, and you want to be educated so please do a bit of research into this before you suggest others cultural appropriation, it was upsetting for me personally.
South Asian women are POC, and have also faced years of racial discrimination for this piercing, so its highly uneducated to suggest that these piercings only apply to African culture. It is true that these don’t necessarily apply to white/British culture further back than the punk/rock era, but even this was adopted from other continents. so yes arguably it may be cultural appropriation for a white/non ethnic person NOT of colour to have one, but it is less harmful than things like white braids, and excessive fake tan and you will be unlikely persecuted by those of colour (black OR brown) for having a nose piercing given the lesser extent that it was shunned by western society in comparison to black/Afro-carribean hair such as an Afro.

Nose piercings aren’t African. They’re a desi (south-Asian) thing. This is hard to answer because it’s been appropriated for so long now but like actually for a long time, piercings were associated with ethnic minorities. They were adopted by white people as some kind of punk symbol I guess and have now become forbidden in a lot of schools and professional places so it’s kind of an example of what can go wrong.
I wouldn’t know whether to call it cultural appropriation or not tbh but like it kind of irritated me that you didn’t even know what culture it’s from. If you wear a nose ring with the chain, I would deffo say that’s cultural appropriation but just having a piercing, I would say is acceptable.

Tw : sexual assault
So I worked at a pub during the summer where I've worked for years. It was a really busy night and I was in one of the back seating rooms cleaning glasses alone. As u can imagine lots of people were really drunk and being a small town loads of people from my old school were there.
This guy I used to be decent friends with when I was about 12/13 (he is 4 years older but was never inappropriate towards me just platonic) saw me in the back room as he left the men's loos which are just past this room. He said hi and asked how I was doing we had a little chat, obviously a bit drunk but nothing crazy, and then he just proceeded to stare at me while I cleaned for ages. I felt really uncomfortable and didn't say anything but he just kept staring. He asked me when I was finishing work and if he could buy me a drink. I politely laughed and said whilst it was really sweet of him to offer, I was on until close so wouldn't have time. Maybe I should've been firmer because after another uncomfortable minute of him staring at me in the doorway, he told me I looked really pretty and starting walking towards me. I was a bit freaked out at this point because there's no other door or exit other than the one behind him. He stops about 1 metre in front of me and I just smile awkwardly. Then he says, 'can I just do something?'. There's a big mirror on the wall in that room so for some reason I thought he was going to take out his phone and take a selfie of us for like old times sake? But he just walked right up to me, put his hands on my bum and pulled me into his and started trying to kiss me. I was pushing his chest trying to get away but he is a pretty strong guy so I was struggling. I had to physically hit him before he let me go and I shouted 'what the f*CK are you doing?' before running away. Now here's my problem- at the time I was freaked out but didn't really see it as a big deal. My managers and co staff were so lovely and he got barred straight away, but recently a friend told me I should've reported him to the police, especially since there would've been CCTV footage. There's been a big surge in woman coming forward about sexual assault etc recently in our city and I'm starting to feel really guilty that I didn't do anything about this incident. I guess I didn't really see it as very serious or like I'd be making a big deal of nothing if I spoke out about it. What scared me most is that I was on my own and he was someone I'd known and trusted for ages. Can someone just tell me I'm not crazy and make me feel a bit better about the whole situation. I can't ask my friends because they've all been through so much worse and it would be unfair to make a big deal out of this

It’s nothing but a bureaucratic nightmare with a facade of officers who have no real power other than the occasional Facebook rally propped up by a team of overworked, exploited permanent staff and underpaid students who fill the holes that should be done by professionals.
Reporting problems to the guild is no different to writing it down on paper and burning it.

Is it weird I would never send nudes, even if I was in a long term relationship? I don’t know if it’s because I’m insecure or super paranoid but it’s something I’d never feel comfortable doing, and boys always act super hurt by the fact I won’t send any

Really confused about what's going on with the gym refund situation. I've heard some people have been saying they haven't been offered refunds and that the gym only offered to extend their membership to next year. However I got an email last week saying they'd refund me £62 if I filled out a form. Have they only offered this to certain people for some reason? What is happening lol

CORRECT ranking of Disney princesses
1. Mulan - easily the best animal sidekick, sacrificed everything to save her father, managed to stay undiscovered as a man, and the girl literally saved China BY HERSELF
2. Moana - i think this is the only Disney film where the concept of romance is never even brought up, it’s so refreshing to have a princess whose storyline has nothing to do with relationships. Moana’s definitely the most empowered princess but Mulan has the ~nostalgia~
3. Jasmine - she was the first princess who stood up for herself and ignored gender stereotypes, big inspiration points for Jasmine (also the first non-white princess honestly Jasmine really did break the mould)
4. Rapunzel - she’s goofy and sweet but she’s also really badass? this gal had never seen other humans or experienced life outside her tower before and then she had an epic journey defending herself and Eugene against a GODDAMN MILITARY
5. Tiana - the first princess to run her own career so that’s pretty dope, she has big Jasmine energy but also she’s a frog for most of the movie so honestly ???
6. Merida - originally i put her lower on this list because of the whole ~i’m angry with my mum so i’m going to give her a magical cake that i bought from a random witch with unknown consequences~ thing, but tbh i love Merida so much - she’s an underrated princess from an underrated movie and had a similar backstory to some of the aforementioned princesses, in that she was going to be married off to some man and she wanted to get out of it and show that she’s stronger by herself. she’s also the only UK princess and i like everything in the film being Scottish
7. Belle - Beauty and the Beast is one of my personal faves and i still love Belle but i do have to acknowledge that she shaded her (mostly lovely) village for simply existing, and the whole stockholm syndrome storyline is a little 😖 still tho she’s hella brave and did everything to save her father
8. Elsa - i know i know she’s a queen not a princess idc she’s still in the list. she’s kinda a loveable villain more than anything else but she’s got dope superpowers and her storyline comes from a place of fear for not fitting in and honestly who doesn’t relate to that
9. Pocahontas - maybe i’m biased cuz i never liked this movie very much and i can appreciate that Pocahontas was strong and brave and educated John on why exactly they were all garbage people whilst protecting her village, but also she had the personality of a damp flannel so
10. Anna - i like Anna and she has a pretty good storyline, she just doesn’t have the same strength as all the princesses who ranked higher. she gets points for sacrificing her life to save Elsa but she loses points for being dumb enough to fall for literally the first man she meets
11. Cinderella - she’s the iconic Disney princess so that’s cool, but tbh the early princesses just weren’t as good, their storylines all revolved around getting the guy and that just doesn’t appeal as much to me. i respect her for having to put up with her family all her life but also the movie makes no sense - why didn’t her shoe change back at midnight ??
12. Ariel - honestly i don’t like Ariel much so i don’t feel guilty about this, she’s whiny and ungrateful and ditzy and literally offers to trade EVERYTHING she has just to meet some guy she saw one time ??? even more than that she decides it’s a great idea to give away her goddamn VOICE to a (albeit fabulous) SEA WITCH ???? Ariel you’re 16 and give me anxiety, go home
13. Aurora - she has 14 lines in her whole film, i don’t think i need to say more
14. Snow White - she literally dies, can you be more helpless than that? also i know she actually has a character where Aurora doesn’t but Snow White’s just so annoying so she’s still at the bottom for me
Honourable mention - Meg from Hercules isn’t considered a Disney princess but if she were she’d definitely be in one of the top spots

Over the last few years I've gained quite a bit of weight (over 40 pounds) mainly due to having to go on an antidepressant (Sertraline), and along the way I also developed PCOS (I had symptoms in my midteens but wasn't diagnosed til 20), which of course isn't helping, because it makes weight loss harder and is linked to sweet cravings, and it's getting me REALLY down. I really want to lose the weight for health reasons, but when there are things set against you that you can't necessarily control (I've tried to go off Sertraline but discovered I really do need it still), it's so hard not to feel demoralized. I'm making the effort to exercise almost daily and eat healthier, but seeing no results.
Can anyone relate or been successful in their weight loss dealing with a similar situation? Is it just going to take longer?

Over the last few years I've gained quite a bit of weight (over 40 pounds) mainly due to having to go on an antidepressant (Sertraline), and along the way I also developed PCOS (I had symptoms in my midteens but wasn't diagnosed til 20), which of course isn't helping, because it makes weight loss harder and is linked to sweet cravings, and it's getting me REALLY down. I really want to lose the weight for health reasons, but when there are things set against you that you can't necessarily control (I've tried to go off Sertraline but discovered I really do need it still), it's so hard not to feel demoralized. I'm making the effort to exercise almost daily and eat healthier, but seeing no results.

American police are involved in around 375 million interactions each year with only a handful of mistakes and unjust killings. The police do an amazing job and I have a huge amount of respect for them. 250,000 people die of preventable deaths in hospitals in the US. Why aren't people out in the streets calling for hospitals to be shut down?

Know a few girls atm supporting BLM and sharing all these great posts about solidarity and education. But I know their boyfriends and they constantly keep starting debates on other people’s posts and sharing rather ignorant and tbh racist posts and statuses- essentially along the lines of “all lives matter” and defending Churchill statues, talking about “British Values” and crap and it’s angering me so much. How can you stand in support as an anti-racist when you are in a relationship with someone who is actively speaking out against protests and refusing to accept that your own country has systemic racism? Throw the whole man away, hun.
P.S. for those who may argue that they should educate their partners- I know they have been trying (or so they have said) and so far there’s not really been any progress. Their partners are military/Tories from privileged backgrounds, white, and also sexist which they seem to excuse as “traditionalist”
Don’t know if I’m just ranting here or asking for advice? I just don’t understand :(

I really don’t want to sound ignorant, but I have tried researching this extensively and I haven’t really found an answer. I really don’t want to be offensive but I am confused.
I have a Jewish friend at university, at one point he told one of our other mutual friends he would never go out with me because I am not Jewish. I didn’t take offense to this because I wasn’t interested in him in the first place, and when the mutual friend told me that he had said that I said back, as a joke, ‘yeah well I wouldn’t date him because he’s Jewish’.
The mutual friend recognised i was joking, he told a few other mutual friends too, who now have said I am an anti-semite.
Is this anti-Semitic? Was I in the wrong? If I was I will 100% apologise, but I really can’t see the difference between what I said and the original boy said. Again I’m really sorry if this is offensive but I’m just trying to understand.

I completely agree with the protests but I think we need to come to terms with the fact it will likely cause a peak in cases. It’s frustrating to see people trying to put reopening schools and pubs on the same level. Schools are opening with small socially distanced class sizes and if it spreads in one class, they are isolated from the others. Pubs are opened outside, fewer customers, socially distanced. Most protests have involved 1000s of people stood shoulder to shoulder screaming and shouting. Using the defence “most were using PPE” is incredibly weak when science has already shown there is no strong evidence to suggest masks alone with prevent you from contracting coronavirus. All it takes is for you to touch the same thing as someone else and then touch your eye. Social distancing is the one and only strong measure. I still agree with the protests because human rights are absolutely crucial and we need to take action NOW but I think we just need to accept it will may cause harm to others. Also it’s important to note the people criticising the protests for causing a second peak on the whole aren’t the type of person to go to street parties for VE day (although its been a month and no increase in cases has been seen because they were largely socially distanced) or the beach, they are typically the type to argue against that as well. Think we just need to respect both sides of the argument and decide for ourselves which is more important.

It’s just a shame that there isn’t this energy when China is dismantling an entire ethnic group in Xinjiang.
Honestly, it seems like campaigning for the rights of certain oppressed minority groups is more “fashionable” than campaigning for the rights of other groups for our Instagram hashtag obsessed generation.

Fat shaming really needs to stop. It makes me so upset. Yeah overweight ppl r less healthy but that's their business not urs. Ur not shaming them because u care abt their health ur shaming them because??? What u want them to feel bad? U want to feel better? U hate yourself? If there wasnt so much fat shaming around I would feel so much more confident in my own body and not have such a crippling fear of gaining weight, even though I'm a healthy bmi and have never been overweight. It's disgusting and horrible and stop doing it u dickhead

Why is UoB, one of the elite universities in the country, so tight and scammy? I know many people overcharged for their accommodation and the uni making them fight tooth and nail to get it back, there is a company that the university owes over £20,000 to for their services to and there are many more instances of the university clinging onto every penny they can and acting like their part of a pyramid scheme. My old university was a bit tight but I've never known anything like UoB. Anyone else have similar experiences?

Any other men hate being men because of association to fuckboys, toxic masculinity and the lad culture? I always get second hand embarrassment and feel guilty when my friends, especially girls, talk about their bad experiences with men. I want to apologise and somehow make it up or just disappear. I feel like I can't get through to the guys because I don't understand how they think and how to speak persuasively (because I didn't do typically boyish things growing up and a lot of the problem lies within the guys who have internalised gender roles) without being dismissed as a simp/f****t/radical feminist. It is very frustrating and I feel utterly useless.

I'm not even sure I'm actually unattractice but my perspective is so warped I don't even know what is attractive anymore. It makes relationships and friendships so hard because I'm constantly questioning what people even see in me that would be attractive. I'm just so tired of the constant anxiety and being afraid to be seen in public etc.... it's messed up my confidence for so long and I just wanna know if there's anything that can be done or if I'm really gonna be stuck with this neurosis forever :(

Right I have a confession as well. Basically I was home schooled for 6 years and when I returned back to school I was way ahead of my peers (three years). I did GCSES and A Levels early and passed with straight As. I was 16 when I started uni- everyone asked why I commuted and that was the reason though I didn't tell anyone and actually didn't go on a night out until two years later.
I met my boyfriend in second year who was 19. And his housemate constantly asked why we hadn't slept together (I was barely legal at the time!!!! And PS none of your business, yes you know who you are) I moved out this year at 18 (going to third year of a 4 year course) and had my first night out etc etc. EVERYONE two years go thought I looked (still look) incredibly young, I'm literally 5ft which makes it worse and have no idea how anyone believes it, y'all daft x

To the guy who said the person who was afraid of intimacy was a cat, did you stop to think about why this person may be afraid?
Maybe they’ve been previously sexually assaulted and it takes them time to get used to human contact?
Or maybe they’re aromantic/ asexual and it takes time for them to feel sexual feelings?
Or maybe they’re just different to you in the way a relationship progresses for them?
I interpreted your comment as invalidating and making a joke out of someone’s preferences in a relationship and that’s not okay.

One person killed george and that person was fired immediately as soon as the video was released and charged a few days later alongside his colleagues, as they should have been. It wasnt a system of racism it was that one dude, the system (from major companies to government institutions to international governments to the UN) all seem pretty united that this dude should be severely punished. No policy would have stopped that murder, far as I can tell, which is the whole justification for why its second degree now. If you think training was the issue then you cant push for second degree murder, that would make it manslaughter and might even leave a path for the cop to go free.

This moment in time is one where we can really reflect on how the institutions governing our society, have very deep-seated problems that are coming to light and they have not worked for many marginalised communities and indeed have exploited them endlessly. And it is uncomfortable, if one is privileged, as I am (I'm not white but nonetheless I do come from a privileged background) to wrestle with the fact that one has benefited from the disenfranchisement and oppression of those less fortunate. But it should be uncomfortable and precisely from that feeling must we strive to do our part to be strong allies to our black brothers and sisters so that we can one day live in a society more just the one we have now.

To solve the problem, you need to understand the problem.
There are two problems. Police brutality, and racism.
The solution to the former is more training and stricter punishment.
The latter: This is not a problem of the police force, but one of society. Yes, we see racial prejudice and discrimination in the police force, but a policeman is not racist because he is a policeman. It is logical to assume that racism runs rampant through all aspects of society, just as much as within the police force, and there is undeniable evidence of this.
‘Fuck the feds’ is therefore not a solution to this problem. Neither is a witch hunt of anyone and everyone who shows the slightest hint of prejudice. It is to educate. If all people, including police officers, are taught to understand racial prejudice and discrimination, where it comes from, and how it affects society, they themselves will be able to identify and eliminate prejudice views and racial bias that have formed within themselves, and within those around them. Schools must throw all of this into the open rather than treat it like the elephant in the room.
The answer to hate is not to hate, but to educate.

Mental health support at Birmingham :
Just spoken to friends at other unis about mental health access and the lack of support at Birmingham is upsetting in comparison. It's really not good enough to be left on long waiting lists and have to jump through hoops whilst the uni cuts funding.
Manchester have a whole building on campus where you are able to book a session with a Councillor when needed with hardly any waiting times.
Compare that to the drop in sessions in the library where the radio is turned up to give privacy.
But sure the chancellor needs half a million pounds this year. Forget the almost daily posts to brumfess from people on the edge who are actually reaching out.
I guess for a long time I've blown off mhs as something not good enough but too difficult to expect more from - I'm sure other unis have issues too but they're TRYING Birmingham needs to do more and even pretend they care

I have hidden a major thing from my friends. They all think I am 20 when in actual fact I am 31. I haven't done anything illegal, all my documents and forms are correct, I just didn't tell anyone. I got away with it because I am a short Indian girl who is 5 feet tall. They always ask me why I am not interested in having a boyfriend but I can't tell them I am married (he looks a lot older than me despite being 33). They wonder why I don't like partying and that is because I feel too old for that now. I created new social media accounts for just my uni friends. My 'dad' that comes and drops me off to uni is actually my older brother. I don't know if I should keep up with this lie, still have two years of uni left. I love my friends and don't want them to look at me like an old lady.

I really need some honest help and advice. For days now I’ve been battling myself and my conscience because I recently discovered texts on my Mum’s phone which show she’s having an affair with someone. I honestly have no clue on Earth what to do, I don’t want to be the one to tell my Dad and break up our family. I’m so lost and confused and upset and I have no one to talk to about it. I’m stuck in the middle, should I confront her or tell my Dad first or just say nothing? Please please if anyone has been in this situation before, I need advice. I feel like I know the right thing to do is but I’m SO SO terrified to do it. Everything is finally right with my family, everyone seems happy at the moment and I can’t help but think how drastically this will change everything if I decide to tell someone. I don’t want anything to change but it’s not right that my Mum is doing this and my Dad has no idea. He doesn’t deserve this.

To the people commenting 'where was this energy when ...' I hope you're just obtuse and not this ignorant or trying to disguise your racism by seeking justice for another cause.
For starters, why didn't you take initiative to organise the protests necessary, yourself, if the matter was that critical to you? I, for one, have always seen the same energy reciprocated on my social media feeds when these sorts of thing crop up - perhaps you should expand your feed to things that really matter to you instead of tik tok and popular useless trends.
The physical protests are not the first to appear, and won't be the last time people speak out on injustice. The media is definitely covering this one in particular a lot more heavily than others because of how widespread it has become, because of how widespread this issue is, and honestly, yes, the American response has catalysed the response everywhere else because of (I will reiterate) how widespread racism is. It does NOT, however, negate the fact that there are other issues out there to be spoken on. Racism does not stop at discrimination of skin colour, it goes as far as discrimination based on beliefs (I do not mean your political stance for those of you dying to be a victim), right down to colourism in a homogeneous community.
To the Brumfess I saw that triggered this response, you sound incredibly All Lives Matterish and even more dismissive of the fact that what is happening now needs to happen. People are not turning a blind eye to other injustices, we're just tackling a certain strain at this time.

I feel like the uni have made it so abundantly clear they don't care about our mental health at all. My 3rd year coursework has been extended by a maximum of a week, exams are still going ahead, a couple of days ago I got an email from mental health services informing me that all cases are being closed and that they're offering no support to students with known mental health issues. Meanwhile, I've been having multiple panic attacks a day, haven't slept properly in nearly 2 weeks, and am having suicidal thoughts worse than I have for years. It's honestly getting to a stage where being at this uni feels incompatible with having a mental illness.

So if we all go into hiding we will slow the spread but not gain immunity by going through the infection recovery process. The whole point if the governments current approach is that healthy individuals should contract the virus and become immune so that they can then look after the elderly and immunocompromised.

We may not be able to grade for belts for a while, but as long as we all stay safe it'll be okay. I just wish I'd known the final training session was the last one so I could say goodbye to the people who aren't returning in September. Love you guys!!

Don't judge people panic buying hundreds of rolls of toilet paper. What if they have really bad diarrhea?
Imagine sitting at home, minding your own business, then a river of liquid shit flies out of your arse like a water fountain. You run to the toilet, hands firmly over your cornhole as brown water leaks out of the gaps between your fingers. You finally sit down and spend hours wiping your arse, every piece of quilted paper giving your tortured asshole a single second of relief, but too soon you've used every piece in the house.
Determined to find more, you stuff newspaper and the family tea towel into your trousers and run to Aldi, pushing aside children and old people as you do so.
Finally, you reach Aldi and you parkour your way over tills, shopping trolleys and innocent bystanders through to the toilet paper. As your hands finally reach the velvet treasure wrapped in pink and see through plastic, your only wish is to tear it open with your teeth right here, but the last spec of dignity prevents you doing so.
You grab every packet you see and run to the till. But someone stops you and tells you to share.
Share? The tens of thousands of paper squares will last an hour at the most. Even though you have shat twice your body weight, you still feel the rumbling of an unholy storm inside of you.
They'll have to rip the paper out of your cold dead hands.
The surrounding hordes of families with small children claw at your body for the ivory prize. You roundhouse kick a granny into the cider bottles, uppercut a father of two into the ceiling and drive your thumbs into a child's eyes but soon they swarm you. Drowning in the mass of crazed limbs and clawing fingers, you are pulled into darkness.
You here your mother's voice, ""Come home""
You burst out of the pile of bodies and steamroll your way to the till, KOing anyone who dares stand in your way.
Unconscious and lifeless bodies cover the ground, as you walk away and into the sunset with 12 packets of bog roll under your arms, only costing you your innocence, and £16.78. You clean your bloody hands with a square of your prize, but you let your tears run wet down your face.
""Even though I'm no better than a beast, don't I have the right to shit?""

My heart really goes out to all the student nurses still out on placement during this whole thing. Saddens me to see that they aren’t being supported by uni and are being used by the nhs. They must be so stressed and tired doing frontline work and assignments at the same time!
Absolute gems our society and uni!
Go give your nursing friends a hug or maybe just an air hug 😅

HATE it when people say psychology is an easy subject. Sure we don’t have many contact hours but we get like a months worth of content thrown at us in a two hour lecture, and about 100000 pages of reading to do outside of that WITHOUT a reading week. We’re constantly doing assignments and they think it’s okay to set them all to be due for the same day which is a day after an exam. It’s really not an easy subject it’s actually very intense and hard to juggle everything at once :(

I work at the Guild. We were told to get our shifts covered if we had any covid-19 symptoms - I have a bad cough and temperature, so got mine covered (and have been in self-isolation).
Now anyone who was supposed to be working will be getting full pay for their shifts. I'm ill, need money for rent, but will receive nothing - thanks to being told I needed to get my shift covered.
Also, apparently some staff knew events would be cancelled up to 1hr before public announcements, so offered to cover shifts knowing they'd get free money).

Just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of the dedicated BUDS committee members and teachers who have spent days choreographing, teaching and organising a show that unfortunately cannot go ahead. I am absolutely gutted, so I cannot even imagine how you guys are feeling right now.
I have had the best time in BUDS this year, I’ve made amazing new friends and gained so much confidence in dance. It has been amazing to develop something I’ve not done before.
It’s such a shame the show can’t go on but thank you to every single one of you - you are all super stars.
Until next year BUDS xxxx

Been worried about this stuff since January but was able to disconnect from it because everything was carrying on as normal here. But in the last week everythings blown up, and my dumb response is to spiral into panic attacks multiple times a day and now I havent slept in 3 days but it feels like I've had 4 coffees or something its weird
Honestly the last thing I can focus on right now are the essays I have due, and seriously think I'm going to flunk out of 1st year a result.
I realise this is a dumb way to react, and every single person is being affected by this situation, and the majority are not acting like this and I'm sorry this message was so poorly constructed, but Does anyone have any advice I can't think straight about anything

Saw a previous post about calling people out for comedic tagging of friends on sexual assault posts and just also wanted to add to this in the context of mental health. See a lot of posts here talking about depression both in serious ways but also in others that are more dubious. I don't want to call out specific dubiois posts as these people genuinely could be suffering, however, what I do want to stress is that until you actually expience what depression is or witness someone you care about suffer, don't go applying comedic responses to it. It's so so so much worse than I think a lot of people are aware of.

Honestly - tell them, either one by one or together, if they aren't horrible human beings, theyll understand and take it into account in future. Going into the kitchen takes time to get used to, but over time the anxiety and jitters will lessen, but try talking to them about it, worst that happens is that things stay the same.

My housemates are either blaring music while they're taking shit at 2am, on the phone so loud the rest of the house can hear at midnight, or crashing pots and pans like there's an earthquake at 6am. I wish they'd just shut the fuck up for once and let me get some sleep.

At this point I’m not really looking forward to living with them next year. Advice on what to do as currently feel like going home and never coming back...

To all the other Biomedics on here slating other people’s degrees, we of all people know what it’s like for certain people (not mentioning any degree in particular) to undermine the difficulty of our course and how much effort it took to get here.

I do some creative writing modules and it's so hard to come up with and develop interesting, original ideas under time pressure, and I'm sure this applies to other modules that include things like art, music composition, etc. Like don't get me wrong, my essay modules are hard too, but there's nothing like the frustration of writer's block when you know you have a deadline in a few weeks.

I have parents who love me and I feel I have made some good friends on my course and they are all a really nice bunch of people. I am very VERY grateful for all of this. But I also still feel very lonely. I genuinely don't understand why, I don't know what else it is I'm expecting but I just have this feeling of isolation in my head? I just feel empty and I'm not really getting much happiness out of uni. I also feel 'unaware' of my surroundings, like I'm trapped in a bubble or I'm watching life go by on a film (DPDR I think, been going on for a while). And whenever I'm around people I seem to enter complete 'happy autopilot' mode, and often feel like I take the easy way out of many social situations through fear of silly consequences but also without much control over my choice. Idk if this is all connected, and to be honest I thought I'd just rant. Any help with all of this would be appreciated. Thanks

I’m the same as you re relationships and crushes and was at this point of questioning my sexuality a few months ago.
Have a google and read some ‘how I knew’ pages - try AVEN. https://www.asexuality.org/?q=overview.html I identified with a lot of things on that website and that’s how I realised I was asexual.
Also like most things, asexuality is a spectrum, you may be somewhere on that spectrum. You could also be demisexual? (only sexually attracted to someone once you feel an emotional connection)

F - I see old joe isn't back yet so I guess a Brumfess will do.
I just wanted to say that I really miss you. I hope you're doing well and I hope that life in general is going alright. It's always when I'm, on my night time come down that I seem to think of you, not sure why because I evidently have moved on but still. Anyway, that's it I guess. I would text but I have now erased you from my phone which is great :).

The problem is more often than not while we are talking he is also playing a Steam game or scrolling through Facebook or reading BBC sport and I can tell he’s not listening. I can hear his keyboard tapping away too lol. I’ve asked if he is too busy and I wouldn’t mind calling a bit less if it meant it was a quality call but he wants to call this much!!!

My ex and I were in the same friendship group and we broke up over the summer. Since they came back I feel like all of that friendship group have chosen them over me and I don't really have any other friends at uni. I'm just trying to get my final year done and out the way and leave all this shit behind me but I'm concerned I've accepted a job here and will be even more lonely next year

TW: Mental Health
I wish it hadn’t taken 20 years of my life and 6 months of therapy to realise this but you aren’t responsible for anyone’s happiness except your own. That’s not to say you shouldn’t be kind to people or try to make them happy where you can, because of course you should, but carrying the full weight of their happiness is just not sustainable for anyone involved. Finding ways to blame yourself when they’re sad or angry and thinking it’s your duty to make them happy again, that will always come at a cost and it’s a cost to you. It’s a hard lesson to learn but sometimes you’ve got to be your own advocate and prioritise what makes you happy, balancing the needs of the people around you but never compromising your own happiness or mental health in the process.
I’ve had this breakthrough in the last month and my anxiety literally halved overnight, it was life changing. And the confidence and happiness I’ve gained have allowed me, counterintuitively, to put more love and happiness into genuine, mutual friendships where we support and look after each other as opposed to just giving everything to someone who doesn’t give anything back.
Anyway sorry for the long, emotional and slightly meandering post but I hope it helps even just one person.

This is a friendly reminder to everyone: start taking vitamin D supplements! It’s very difficult to get enough from food alone and you can’t get enough from the winter sun either, so take supplements between November and April.

Please help:( my best friend of pretty much 10 years is what I would call a ‘high functioning addict’ (I’m obviously no pro for terminology) it started off she was doing the occasional drug in a rave once every 2 months or so, so pretty standard but i feel like it’s almost everyday now she’s high. There’s only so much I can give her pep talks and tell her she’s at uni and has other priorities (she does agree with me but I feel like she’s not taking it seriously and jokes about it). What makes it worse is her other friends encourage it making her not take it seriously even more. Like I said there’s only so much I can do and it’s really stressing me out to see this but I feel like because she is still functioning pretty normally she’s not gonna stop because she hasn’t faced the consequences yet. What can I do pls

Okay so basically I’m really bad at approaching guys in general, but if I like them then it’s worse.
I don’t know what comes over me but every time I see them or make eye contact with them I just become quite awkward and I think my face frowns and I look quite moody - this is a deterrent for people wishing to approach me.
Any ideas how I can overcome this and actually start talk to guys I like?

Tw- eating disorder
I'm worried I've developed an eating disorder. Started out as trying to lose weight but struggling to get back to eating normally, I know I should eat more than i do but feel guilty when I do. I'm constantly worried about food and how many calories are in things and how to burn it off. Any advice on getting back on track would be hugely appreciated as I'm worried I'm going to keep getting worse.

housemates who change the heater timers when it’s just them in the house are the worst (its also very obvious you’ve done it, even if you change it back before we get home)
If you’re finding it cold speak to the rest of the house and decide on a better timer schedule together, so everyone can benefit from it being on more, not just you (putting on a jumper helps too).

I'm a having relationship troubles at the moment and I'm honestly so confused and hurt by things as two misinterpreteded situations have potentially ruined the relationship. All I've done is my best to continue making contact, being pleasant and apologising for anything I've said that's been misinterpreted. All I can do is wait and continue to be pleasant but it's taking such a toll on me.
I have never felt more alone, confused ad quite frankly distraught. Does time truly heal and I've just got wait as the situation is relatively trivial? How long is enough time to let my partner heal?
How do I know what to do if I haven't been explcilty told/my partner hasn't read my apologies?

To any freshers (or above!) who are worried about pre-established groups or ‘cliquey’ societies, please know that it isn’t because they don’t want to get to know you! I was so intimidated joining societies with really tight groups last year but if you stick at it then it becomes less scary - from my experience it’s because they’ve become good friends and hang out outside of the society, not because they’re not open to new people. There’ll always be friendly people who will reach out if you feel a bit lost (committees are a good place to start if you’re apprehensive, their whole thing is helping bring new people to the society) and you’ll meet some amazing people, I met some of my closest friends in societies!

Does anyone have any tips to become more body confident? Since starting uni last year I’ve gone from a size 10 to a size 14 and I was feeling fine until my mum started making comments saying I needed an ‘intervention’. It got me really down and made me feel like I was morbidly obese or something even though I know a size 14 is the average size of women in this country.
I have got a gym membership this year not too lose weight but to gain muscle to make myself feel stronger. Does anyone have any other tips to feel body confident in myself??

I need some advice... my partner is suffering from bad mental health, they are very reluctant to get any help or even talk to their other friends about it. This puts a lot of pressure on me as the only person they talk to. I know they are ill and they genuinely can’t help it, but often their actions as a result of mental illness are very upsetting to me. It’s so difficult because I know they’re really unwell, but it’s also not fair that they do things that hurt me. I have no idea if this is just me being selfish, I really hope it isn’t, I just have no idea what to do. These kind of behaviours wouldn’t be acceptable if anyone else had done them. It would be easier to cope with if they were making some active choices to try to help themselves, but they aren’t, and it’s starting to hurt the people around them 😞

One of my close friends binge eats and takes laxatives to not gain too much weight; i told them i dont think it's healthy but they said its ok because a lot of weight loss diet kits include laxatives so I was wondering whether I should persuade them to see someone about it or whether taking laxatives to not gain weight from binge eating is ok

Exams are not a test of your competence in a subject. They are a test of how good you are at recalling what you’ve read on paper or on a screen. Don’t question your ability in your subject if you get poor results. You are probably more competent in the subject than the sweat heads who get 90s and have been revising for the past 6 months. Exams are just a reflection of memory capacity. Fuck them :-) x

TW: suicide
I lost my boyfriend to suicide at the beginning of this academic year and so this year has been so so hard for me. I don’t even want to be at uni anymore but I’m just trying to get through my exams so I can go home. My housemates seem to have forgotten that I’m still sad and act like I’m boring etc when I don’t want to do stuff with them or go to the pub etc. But I’m just not in the mood, that stuff doesn’t make me happy anymore. I feel so alone. What can I do :(

So the Guild has a massive problem with barstaff giving away free drinks and being understaffed for club shifts, but gives staff absolutely no 'staff perks' like other clubs/bars/pubs.
Maybe give staff who do x amount of club shifts a free fab ticket? Or staff who've done a certain amount of club shifts during a year get priority access to gradball tickets? Or provide taxis home like every other club in Birmingham?
(Also just saying, they changed the end time of fab/sports night to 4am from 3am without even checking that staff would want to stay the extra hour???)

If any of yall are gonna become teachers... pffttt... it's gonna be so so so easy for kids to look you up on google and find you!

There's been some talk about planes and the environment recently and I have something for you guys to think about.
Let's take a journey,say LHR to Edinburgh and compare the carbon emission of a plane, say an a320 which is widely used on this route, and a car, say a Ford Mondeo 1.8.
Starting with the plane, the a320 releases 3.13kg/km of CO2. The journey by air from LHR to Edinburgh is 530 km. With some simple maths we can calculate that the journey releases = 530 km x 3.13kg = 1658.9 kg of CO2.
Now if we look at the Ford, it release 0.151kg/km of CO2. A journey by road to Edinburgh from LHR is 650km. Again we can calculate the CO2 released to be 98.15kg of CO2.
Clearly , the plane releases much more CO2 but it doesn't end here. We have to take into account the number of passengers each mode of transport can carry.
An A320 can carry about 150 pax but for realism sake let's say on this particular day 130 passengers are flying. The amount of CO2 released taking this into account is 1658.9kg/130pax = 12.76 kg/pax
Again, the Ford can carry 5 passengers. In this instance let's assume we have a full car. The CO2 released is 98.15 kg/5 pax = 19.63kg/pax.
If we reduce the number of pax the difference widens.
To match the fuel efficiency of the a320, the car would need a fuel burn of 85g/km, if 5 people travel in it.
I'm gonna leave you all to draw your own conclusions,
Yours sincerely,
An engineering student

Was sexually assaulted last year and been attempting to cope with it on my own due to lack of moral support (It was a supposed ""friend"" who did it, and the entire social group have just stuck up for him.)
My self harm had gotten to the point where I'm cutting myself again. It happened at a fab and I feel the Guild have to deal with it because it happened on their grounds. I don't know exactly who to report this to as I poured my heart out to supposed friends about it and I'm getting severe suicidal thoughts rn because no one has taken what happened to me seriously and just do nothing bit stick up for the guy.

Must have pure York blood that goes back to the Middle Ages at least. Bonus points if you know about the York Mystery Plays, because he is very proud of his heritage (since he is from York).

This uni is actually a joke. We have the fire alarm go off so we miss our first exam, it's rescheduled so we have to put up with another week of stress, we lose the next weekend to revision. BUT THE OTHER HALF OF THE YEAR GET THE MARKS ADDED TO THEIR PAPER FOR SPECIAL CONSIDERATION.

If you have any muscular pain or injury genuinely try the new CBD range from Holland & Barrett. For those who’ve been living under a rock, CBD is a strain of weed that does not THC (the one that makes you high), and so has no hallucinogenic properties. I use the muscle balm on my back and it is like deep heat on steroids! Until now I have not found something that works so quickly AND lasts for a decent amount of time. I warn you it does feel strange when it starts to heat up, but that subsides over about a 20-30 minute time span. Will definitely be trying more of the products out in the future.

Had a bit of a binge-watch of Downton Abbey tonight.
In one of the episodes Anna says ""he's a good man. And good men are not like busses- there won't be another one along in 10 minutes time.""
And i just sat there thinking ""yep, preach girl.""
But this is a series based in 1919. And ""good men"" are still virtually non-existent in my experience and I find that just sad.

So I went on to the guild's website this afternoon to look at events coming up. Saw the colour run on the vale advertised, nice, nice, been looking forward to that because my amazing friend and i were going to get our sleep-deprived work-intense selves up to the vale to exercise and have a bit of fun (and maybe go to a party or two afterwards). I start reading through the description - goodie bags, t-shirts, what not all for roughly £7 okay i can handle that contribution from my bank. THEN I SAW THE ** FINAL ** LINE:
**please note this event is open to students living in UoB or Partner Accommodation Only**
DIDN'T REALISE THIS EVENT WAS CO-RUN/ORGANISED BY THE HALL REPS AND WOULDN'T ALLOW ANY SUBSEQUENT YEARS not LIVING IN UNI ACCOM TO ATTEND as when it was advertised by the sports officer on fabbo it seemed like a general event for anyone/everyone. Also cause it's for charity the more people the better (obs health and safety risks come into this but you get my gist). I'M SO MAD THOUGH because would've loved to do it and now i'll never get the chance!!! ANYONE ELSE OR JUST ME?

I'M SO MAD THOUGH because would've loved to do it and now i'll never get the chance!!! ANYONE ELSE OR JUST ME?
**please note this post is open to EVERYONE WHO IS INTERESTED**

Just a little note. It can be really draining helping a friend who’s struggling with their mental health, and sometimes a little appreciation can go a very, very long way. It can be all it takes to make the person who’s been there through it all feel a lot better about continuing to help.

Since today is International Women's Day, I think now is an appropriate time to speak about the amount of sexist twats that still exist in today's society.
Today, I heard about some truly shocking behaviour that occured within earshot of my friend, and without regard to how she may have felt in regard to this.
I find it almost unbelievable that young people in this day and age feel the need to inflate their own egos by belittling others (particularly women) just because their mummies and daddies have paid for them to get here.
Little gestures and comments such as 'are you sure you're right?' and automatically correcting women in any environment is completely unacceptable. We need to put a stop to this!
Please, if you see anyone upset by something such as this, or hear someone being a general prick, do something!
Sincerely,
A concerned UoB student

I am a woman with herpes and it is not as bad as everyone seems to make it out to be. The stigma is worse than actually having it is. It is pretty much just a rash ! I’ve had it for about a year and only had one outbreak which was the initial one when I realised I had it. The risk of transmission, female to male, is 1.7 out of 1000 unprotected sex acts and 0.6 for protected sex acts. 80% of people who have it didn’t realise they did as the virus typically lays dormant. I know we have a long way to go to change the stigma surrounding herpes but I wish people would eductate themselves on the facts as it’s actually extremely common. 1 in 5 people actually have it!! It genuinely hasn’t affected my life in anyway except made me feel sad whenever i hear or see jokes across social media about it. Please don’t tag your friends in this post it’s not funny. I didn’t acquire this because I’m promiscuous or unsafe, I took precautions and have only had four sexual partners but still acquired it. It can happen to anyone.

Each to their own but watching your primark thong slide around your crack on the way to my 9am just doesn’t do it for me. I just want to ask - are you aware? Is it intentional?

I have always thought I was particularly fat or skinny, but as of late my parents (mostly my mum) have been telling me I look really skinny when I come back from uni. It was fine at first, but now it's starting to hurt as I feel like it's an insult. Im 5'8 and I weight 62kgs, and I've always thought I was healthy but I don't know what to do anymore. Do I need to put on weight? Is it even a bad thing to be a little underweight?

right so this addressed is to every selly oak student who doesn't know how to behave in a shop, on behalf of all of us poor, hard done to, supermarket workers:
1 - if you don't know how to use self service, that's fine, but don't scan one thing, give up, and then come to the main till - the people behind can't then use it, and I have to go all the way around to cancel your shit off
2 - stop wearing your headphones when I'm serving you. it's fucking rude. and especially don't get annoyed if I then don't give you a bag or whatever - I asked, you just couldn't hear, which is not my problem
3 -don't leave your rubbish in our shop, especially not your disgusting takeaway chicken bones. we have to clean it up!! if you do this, you're a massive knob
4 - also, don't deliberately make a mess! if you change your mind, put it back where you got it, the shops aren't that big. and don't ruin my neatly tidied shelves and then laugh, it's fucking obnoxious
5 - literally don't yell at me for doing my job, especially if you're drunk - it's horrid, and I will remember your face when I see you in the library the next day
6 - WE DO NOT ACCEPT STUDENT ID AS PROPER IDENTIFICATION!!!! (can't emphasise this enough, it's not that hard, and yes, i do have to ID you every time)
7 - i literally don't care if you're buying condoms. no one cares. you're not that special just cos you're getting laid, so stop with the shit awkward banter
8 - when i make a bad joke, i don't care if you find it funny, if I'm on till for 8 hours straight, it's only myself i'm trying to amuse. but also do the decent thing and give me a half hearted laugh, it's the least you could do
9 - if our doors don't open automatically, then we're closed, and standing there shouting at me just makes you look like an idiot
10 - essentially just stop treating me like shit just cos i work in a shop! not all of us can be funded through uni via the bank of mum and dad, and it's hard enough being a working class student without your arrogance, and i'm definitely not gonna serve you any quicker if you have a shitty attitude

TW: eating disorders
My flatmate keeps commenting on what I eat and it’s really starting to get to me. I’ve told her I’ve had problems with disordered eating in the past but she keeps making snide comments every time I make dinner. It’s making me feel really uncomfortable and now I don’t even want to eat in front of her. I get she thinks it’s funny but it just isn’t when it’s everyday, I don’t even pretend to find it funny anymore but that doesn’t seem to stop her. Wish she’d just let me get on with it and worry a bit more about herself

I’ve been swimming for a long time but I’m now no longer feeling body confident. I used to fine with my body but I’m no longer happy with myself, even though my bf still compliments well. I’m embarrassed about going to the gym because I don’t want people to stare at someone who is picking up the smaller weights to buff up. Has anyone got advice?

I’ve kissed a few girls on nights out so my friends all just assumed I’m bi, but I’ve come to realise that actually I’m mostly straight and kissing/cuddling is about as far as it will ever go with girls. This is all fine, but all my friends are lgbt and make a big deal out of the fact we’re a “gay club” and “hahaha straight people” etc. And it’s too much pressure for me to tell them otherwise so I have to keep pretending I’m really into girls too... they don’t have an issue with straight people at all, but they love their little gay group and I don’t want to be the butt of all the jokes

Alright UoB, I need some advice.
I've been talking to a girl nearly everyday during Semester 1 and I thought that during the Winter Holidays we would be talking even more, since we don't have our degree courses to worry about.
But ever since she got back home we have rarely spoken, she says its because she's with her family so she doesn't use Social Media that much, and I don't know how to deal with it. I miss our conversations so much and the holidays just feel extremely boring without them.
So, what do I do?

Being home for Christmas has made me feel even more alone than before. Don’t get me wrong I have lots of friends that I love but all anyone talks about around me is their relationships and who they should set me up with and I’m getting very very tired of it all. And everytime I think it’s going well with a guy again they start to ignore me and I realise I didn’t actually matter to them how they mattered to me.

Hi anon. Every time I go to lgbt coffee I feel excluded also. Every time I go I really try but it’s difficult breaking into strong friendship groups. Personally if I was part of the committee I’d make sure new faces had someone to talk to 100% of the time. It feels like if you aren’t into the stuff they are you are screwed. Especially been as I’m not a stereotypical gay I pass as straight quite well.
I’ve also found that the regulars who do chat to you go get some tea and then get distracted so you’re left on your own for AGES and forced to go in a new convo mid-way through.
Alternatively they will chat to someone NEXT to you and it feels as if I don’t exist.
It’s scary enough going in on your own. I don’t think I will try again. I don’t know what to do or where else to go.

I had this exact experience which was unexpected because I thought it would be extremely welcoming. I'm not saying the LGBT+ society is completely unwelcome, I'm sure to some it is a really nice safe group. But I think more needs be done to be welcoming to everyone that attends, not just some people. To someone attending for the first few times it felt to me like there was an exclusive group in the association and I didn't feel confident enough to try and include myself in an environment that wasn't as welcoming as I thought it would be.
I'm sure everyone is the association is actually great, I just think maybe there could be a bit more awareness that some people might be really shy or not that confident yet, still figuring things out etc and could really benefit from feeling a more open atmosphere!

Everyone is with people they love, having fun and feeling festive and all that, but this time of the year always makes me feel like absolute shit. I try to enjoy it but I just can't, it's like everything good around me is mocking me. I can't immerse myself in the festive mood because it just makes me feel even worse and even more depressed.

I went to visit my friend in Bristol in October who in some very unfortunate circumstance attends the fake UoB. Upon arrival, I discovered a host of University of Bristol (aka shit show) memorabilia, ranging from posters to fridge magnets. It was at this moment that I knew I was behind enemy lines, knowing it was my sole duty as a true member of the UoB cult to compromise their mission of identity theft. I returned to Bristol a couple of days ago, having purchased my own University of Birmingham gifts, and when my friend had left his house I stole all the Bristol ones. When my friend and his housemates return after Christmas, they will discover that their whole house has been replaced with a very obvious reminder that Bristol is in fact inferior, and a fake in the shadow of the mighty Birmingham. I am planning to host a celebratory burning of their blasphemous items. You’re all welcome to follow my revolution. A merry Christmas to you all.

I returned to Bristol a couple of days ago, having purchased my own University of Birmingham gifts, and when my friend had left his house I stole all the Bristol ones. When my friend and his housemates return after Christmas, they will discover that their whole house has been replaced with a very obvious reminder that Bristol is in fact inferior, and a fake in the shadow of the mighty Birmingham. I am planning to host a celebratory burning of their blasphemous items. You’re all welcome to follow my revolution. A merry Christmas to you all.

You're at a Christmas party. You're talking about your favourite things about Christmas. Favourite foods, favourite traditions, what type of meat you're eating this year, which of your relatives are the most enthusiastic racists.
Then, the dreaded topic comes up. Favourite Christmas movies. Perfectly acceptable answers are put forward; ""Elf"", ""Muppets Christmas Carol"", ""Shrek the Halls"", but you're waiting. You're waiting for that one guy. That one guy who thinks he's original. He opens his mouth, your back tenses up and you start convulsing. Red foam starts erupting from your mouth and nostrils as you anticipate
""My favourite Christmas movie is Die Hard.""
I swear to god. I swear to fucking God. Everyone in the world has heard this, but every goddamn time someone says it they think they are the comedy messiah. It's always delivered with a shit-eating grin and bulging eyes, and an obvious belief that they have blown the minds of everyone listening. Well guess what, you haven't. We know. Everyone knows. My old alzheimers grandfather's dying words were ""Die Hard is a Christmas movie"", because after he said it I immediately unplugged his life support as he had clearly finally lost all mental traces of originality.
Please. Can we make 2018 the last year amateur comedians tell this long dead joke.

Imagine if everyone wore hats everywhere like in the olden days
We could wear top hats at weddings
Baseball caps
Fezzes
All types of hats
Just see a guy walking down the street in a sombrero
I want to live in that world, where all hats are accepted in all settings
Join me in making this world a reality, and start expressing yourself through wearing all kinds of hats wherever you go

*anxiety related post*
So I've been at uni since October now and I just haven't been feeling myself. I am really not an anxious person, I'm free loving and I am usually so focused on things like my work and sport that feelings would never get in the way. But I've been having some bad experiences here, and they have brought back some really hard times from my past, which again I just buried and didn't let them affect me. I worked hard and got to uni and now I am struggling to do even the little things. I just cry over these tiny things and I'm usually so strong. Does anyone have any advice on what to do? I am so determined to do well here but I'm finding it so hard. The main cause of my issues has gone but I am finding myself so affected. I'm trying to figure out why now, why after years of having a bad time at home, I'm finally away and now I'm struggling? It makes no sense to me...

I had a similar problem two years back- lost a lot of weight and got compliments all the time, couldn't tell anyone my amazing ""diet"" was severe bulimia to the point I was vomiting about 5 times a day... got even worse confidence-wise when I recovered and put the weight back on and got a lot of negative comments from my family. I hope it gets easier for you- I always try to remind myself it's better that I've gained the weight back than end up killing myself through the way I was treating my body, losing weight the slow way is so hard but it's gotta be better than the alternative

I'm really hating being home for Christmas. My family switched mine and my sister's bedrooms around whilst I was away, all my stuff is packed away and my new bedroom is smaller than my one at uni now. It feels so lonely being away from my friends, and I had a full on breakdown earlier because I felt so unwelcome and separated from my family. The only reason I'm staying is because I've made a commitment to my manager to work , which I genuinely look forward to more than coming home, and that my boyfriend is nearby when he normally isn't whilst I'm at uni. I'm honestly just missing being alone and away from my incredibly annoying younger sisters.
My family push the family aspect of the festive season too much for me, I'm now at a stage where I wish I could just spend christmas day with my boyfriend and my cat, rather than be forced to spend time with extended family. Basically, I'm dreading Christmas this year.
If anyone has any ideas as to how to cope with this please let me know, I'm seriouslt thinking about going back to uni because I'm just that upset.
And yes, I have spoken to my parents about it - my mum told me to grow up. For context, my boyfriend is pushing me to seek treatment for depression and I think I either have autism or BPD. So in short, she couldn't care less if I hate every second of being at home.

I'm feeling really lonely. I have lots of people around me, but everyone has one person they are super close to, and I'm not especially close to anyone. It doesn't help that I live with an odd number of people in my house who are all friends and will go spend time together, leaving me alone a lot of the time. I've tried expressing how I feel on a few occasions, but it doesn't seem to have helped. If anything, there were comments about how its really annoying when people feel like others dislike them. I don't know if it's in my head, or if they actually don't like me, and I'm too afraid to ask now. I'd much rather know if they disliked me, and then I could put more effort into other friends and societies and sport.

So the last couple years due to family issues my christmases have been less festive than they were feisty.
Last night our house had the loveliest Christmas together, went to the Christmas markets watched elf and shared our secret Santa presents.
Just remember guys that no matter your personal isssues your friends will always be an amazing support system, and while things might seem shit you should appreciate the little things in uni like spending time with lovely people and supporting each other
Things get better just give them time, and make sure to treat those around you with great attention this festive season, and for some this Christmas break isn’t going home to a happy place.
Uni can be hard guys but make sure those around you are getting through it with support and care

Just been reminded again that we’re at the end of the term. I just thought to myself, what do I even have to go back for? I cut off my few friends before moving to uni because they were toxic and then I had to go through a bereavement in secret, I’ve literally only told one person who lives with me and hid my pain from everyone else because I’m emotionally dense and wouldn’t even know where to start.
Now that I’m back again, we’re leaving. I’ve never gotten along with my family really so it’s going from having literally over 100-200 new faces who you’re at least on speaking terms with through societies, my course, sports and accomodation to going back with those few fake friends, who haven’t been interested since I moved here and a family that you don’t get along with and just to stop the boredom.
I won’t miss a break from my back to back assignments and 9am seminars in the freezing cold but I wanted to enjoy the social life of uni fully for once because the two-thirds of the term, I was just about keeping it together.
I’m a positive person though, so I’m looking forward to coming back next term, bottle of rum in one hand, books in the other but I’ve been feeling a bit self-conscious about my initial lack of sociability for some reason.
Hopefully I can speak to the guys I’m interested in and chat more with the people I genuinely want to be friends with next term and that it’s not too late. We’ve still got two more terms.
And thanks to my one flatmate for listening to my bullshit.

I’ve never gotten along with my family really so it’s going from having literally over 100-200 new faces who you’re at least on speaking terms with through societies, my course, sports and accomodation to going back with those few fake friends, who haven’t been interested since I moved here and a family that you don’t get along with and just to stop the boredom.
I won’t miss a break from my back to back assignments and 9am seminars in the freezing cold but I wanted to enjoy the social life of uni fully for once because the two-thirds of the term, I was just about keeping it together.
I’m a positive person though, so I’m looking forward to coming back next term, bottle of rum in one hand, books in the other but I’ve been feeling a bit self-conscious about my initial lack of sociability for some reason.
Hopefully I can speak to the guys I’m interested in and chat more with the people I genuinely want to be friends with next term and that it’s not too late. We’ve still got two more terms.
And thanks to my one flatmate for listening to my bullshit.

Who tf even wants to study at the library? Plenty of other study spaces across campus during the week that are better and it is very much possible to stay in and do some work at home as well. Unless you need a computer to do something and don't own one, I see no reason to bother yourself with the stress of going all the way to the library for a shitty studying experience. Trying to endure the atmosphere where breathing is considered too much noise, leaving your seat for 15 minutes is a catastrophe or people eyefuck you and do creepy posts about you on Old Joemance when you're just trying to study (or perhaps that's the top reason to study there), it's just too much.
Been to the library a grand total of 0 times this term and doing quite well on a tough course. Can recommend.

Makes me feel honestly sick that people want to stop Brexit. I was fully a remain supporter but I support democracy over anything else. The EU refurendum was a chance for people in safe seats to have a real vote, and they voted to leave - to overturn the result would ruin the credibility of our democracy. Why do the London elites, who think that they know what's best, feel that they can try stop it? If voters choose to cause self-harm to the country, that's what should be done. It's democracy.
Ironically, eventhough his supporters overwhelmingly support remain, it is essentially Jeremy Corbyn's fault that we are in this situation. He never campaigned passionately for remain and even went on holiday during the campaight. He's too corrupt to admit to his supporters that he wants Brexit so that he can finally implement his Marxist policies, which will destroy the country far more than Brexit ever could.

Last night my ex sent me a snapchat of her shaking her ass on another guys crotch, her friend had filmed. I got upset and I told her I thought it was disrespectful and why the fuck would she send me that and it felt like she is just trying to rub in the fact that she can do what she wants now. She told me im being overly dramatic and I should see the funny side. Am I being overly dramatic? We broke up over 2 months ago.. and the video was for like 3 seconds only.. idk she's making me feel stupid and I dont know if I should suck it up and just get over it and maintain good terms with her or if I want to keep arguing and probably ruin our friendship, which I value a lot, if she doesn't apologise

As my last post (#brumfess1844) was taken down due to “legal implications”, I’ll make this one less personal.
Here is my guide (FOR EVERYONE) on how not to take advantage of a drunk girl:
1) Do not say you’ve lost your keys so you need to stay in her flat when you know they’re in your pocket.
2) Do not pretend you’re “taking care of her” when all you’ll do is make sure she’s in your bed and undressed.
3) Do not snog her in the middle of a club dance floor when minutes before she was leaning against a wall, unable to keep her eyes open (especially if you know full well she is in this state).
4) Do not say you just want to “hang out” and “watch TV” with her if you’re planning on or have any intention of doing anything other than this.
5) If she gives you consent to do anything sexual, do not act on it unless you know she has sobered up. Take it with a massive pinch of salt. A drunk ‘yes’ isn’t always a ‘yes’ the next morning.
P.s. if you’re reading this and think this is directed towards you... it probably is :)

""Do you not think it is completely wrong that the WOMEN AND NON-BINARY GROUP are so excluding of MEN?""
That sentence is the most ridiculous thing. No. No I don't think its wrong. Its a safe space for women and non-binary persons, why does everything have to cater towards men? Why can't we have this ONE thing? Completely agree that issues like sexual assault, toxic masculinity, mental health etc. affect men too, but there's already spaces where they can express their opinions and talk about these things e.g. feminist soc, your ideas page on guild website etc. We shouldn't have to open up the WOMEN AND NB GROUP to include men as well - that literally defeats the entire purpose!!
You say that you ""understand the need for a safe space"", but really, I don't think you do.

It's just that it seems like the few times I do put myself first, or at least not dead last, or the few times I decide I *do* deserve better than what I'm getting, people tell me I'm a selfish, disgusting egotist, as if the rest of the year I spent neglecting my own mental health to help the people that actually matter didn't happen.

Why do we have someone so incompetent running the Fab n Fresh page? I rarely see a post from Daniel Vollrath that doesn't have some kind of spelling/grammar mistake or just generally sounds like it was written by a 6 year old. I know it's not an official uni page but its just a bit wank.

Wowee the Brumfess submission rate has really ramped up of late, am I right? It makes me worried that my top banter or insightful remarks may not get the appreciation they deserve because there's simply too much competition.
Like, look it this post for example. I guarantee you, no reactions or comments. Go on. Prove me wrong.

Hey guys, recently my flatmates been training for the Mr Cumbria competition so he’s been working really hard to get in the best shape possible for. This obviously means that his diet has to be on point, but I’m worried it’s getting out of hand. I’ve told him that the diet his trainers put him on it’s too strict.
At 8 o’clock he’ll have fish and a rice cake.
At 10 o’clock he’ll have fish.
At 12 o’clock he’ll have fish and a rice cake.
At 2 o’clock he’ll have fish.
At 4 o’clock, just before he trains, he’ll have fish and a rice cake.
He’ll train. He’ll have his fish. Then he’ll come home, have some fish and a rice cake.
And then that’s it for the day.
What should I say to him??

Sorry but are people actually seriously equating the height thing with being size 6 like wtf. I would never want to make someone feel insecure about their height and don’t think it should be a massive factor in attraction but it’s not as risky a thing to encourage. People develop eating disorders because of the idea that only size 6 or only size zero is good enough. It’s really damaging to society. I’m not aware of anything similar happening to people who want to be taller. It’s something you have to learn to accept. Honestly I can’t really defend people sticking a height requirement nor the people who specify races beyond like if you are both of a certain race if you’re really integrated in the cultures it can be supportive but woooow it’s just not the same as asking someone to be size 6

Is anyone else of sick of being fucked over by the uni ?
The university doesn’t give a shit about the students, everything from the student welfare to the lecturers are apauling.
We are a russle group university and it shows, our lecturers are researchers not teachers they don’t care about the quality of the classes the teach as long as they keep getting funded for their research. They are there for the money not because they care for the students and it’s becoming more and more obvious.
The uni spends millions on a piss-poor library and a gym they’d rather provide to the locals than to the students. They built a hotel and conference center for money, they are building new accommodation for students when they can’t look after us now. They pay the vice chairman nearly £500,000 a year and Hess too scared to ever attend a student event because he can’t face criticism. Before I joined, when students payed £3000, they uni used to provide £250 towards books. Now we pay double and revive nothing and if that isn’t symbolic of this price of shit uni I don’t know what is. I don’t feel like I’m the only person who came here following a lie about how spectacular this place is and now can’t leave because of the time and money invested into it. This is a rant I know and I want to try word it better but the uni needs to know that we know it’s fucking us and that we are sick of just bending over and taking it.

Now we pay double and revive nothing and if that isn’t symbolic of this price of shit uni I don’t know what is. I don’t feel like I’m the only person who came here following a lie about how spectacular this place is and now can’t leave because of the time and money invested into it. This is a rant I know and I want to try word it better but the uni needs to know that we know it’s fucking us and that we are sick of just bending over and taking it.

The whole point that UoB is our title is based on how much effort it is to say University of Birmingham. Also that there is 5 unis in this city and at least 3 have 'Birmingham' in their title. That's why we say 'UoB'.
I swear in Bristol they just have University of Bristol and UWE.
Everyone knows which one you mean if you say 'bristol uni' as oppose to 'birmingham uni' could mean any of 3. So they need to chin up and let us have UoB.

I completely agree with you x, but what really got my attention on your post wasn't the actual content it was the comments from our 'representitives' i.e. the people we should be looking up to for guidance and support. As a girl too, I have to say I've never made a post before but the level of misconduct was unacceptable to me!
The worst offender was an incredibly inflammatory, poorly worded, and dare I say dangerous remark saying that ' women and non binary people's safety is more important' [than men's].
That's just plain misandry saying something like that! ALL people of the university should have equal safety and equal right to it, and saying otherwise actually motivated me enough into making this. If you mean, 'the issue of women and non binary safety is more PREVALENT across campus' then you might be right. Saying the issue needs to be taken more SERIOUSLY is also a fair point, but so does the issue of male harrassment, regardless of prevalence. I've had housemates come home from Fab and other events saying they'd been touched/stroked/cornered and their space invaded by a woman refusing to respect their boundaries or leave them alone, and coming home trying to hold in tears when they tried speaking to people but weren't taken seriously just for having an XY and not an XX. This goes both ways and we need men on board.
At the end of the day, why does anyone who's a member of a society that excludes men actually care if men have a society to talk about their issues in a safe space that you have you yours. Literally nothing would change for you in your society, there'd be no more men trying to 'get in' than before, and if anything the issues of consent and harassement would be able to be talked about in an environment that men feel comfortable with and can understand much better than in one of the womens ones.
Also whoever said women were a minority group, we make up 50% of the population, and I don't see there being any male societies currently that exclude women and others, unlike ours. Just let them have their safe space in the same way we have ours, it's not harming anyone and least of all us.

Looking for a group of chaps who want to cause chaos and get mummy and daddy to foot the bill
Looking to recruit 3 people who will then serve on a board to accept new members max 12 people in the club, anymore is a crowd
Requirements : -must live in Chamberlain (obviously) and must be cultured enough to recognise a Monet, a Delacroix and a piece of Beethoven. Cannot be a member of the Conservative Party and must be a European. Chamberlain is a place for Liberal Elites, not populists. You essentially must be a champagne socialist.
If you have difficulty understanding the requirements don’t bother applying.
A single “like” will be adequate for application. We will be in touch.

The only person I'd feel comfortable enough to talk to has way worse problems of their own, my own struggles would just pale in comparison and it would feel insensitive and wrong to burden them with me when they have it so so so much worse.

I identified as non-binary when I was younger (used xe, xer, the whole shebang). I was gay and confused and dived into Tumblr to come to terms with my sexuality and work out my identity. Because I'm a bit masculine and have some boyish interests, the community there got me believing that I was non-binary, being somewhere between man and woman, despite me being happy with my body. Since interacting with other gay people finally at uni, I've realised that gender expression is different from gender identity. A girl can like boyish things and still be a girl. A boy can like girlish things and still be a boy. These things shouldn't affect your pronouns. (PS, I have mad respect for trans people who suffer body dysmorphia and would never seek to invalidate them.)

I need advice. Last week I found out that my housemate is transphobic. It never came up 'in conversation' up until now because quite a few of my friends (including my best friend back home) are trans and the issue is quite close to my heart and not something I can bring up around casual friends without getting emotional. But now that I know I live with a transphobe, I feel conflicted.
I could confront him and live miserably for the rest of the year; he's not a good housemate as it is and I don't want to be unwelcome in my own house. My other housemates are pretty chill and they don't need drama either. But staying silent makes me feel dirty. I said I disagree with him but I feel like not saying more legitimises his bullshit. Also, I want to be able to invite my friend to stay with me without exposing them to someone who will make them feel unsafe.
I need to be good friend and ally without compromising my living situation/mental health. I'm living with different people next year so I need a short term solution from people with more wisdom please.

here's a hot take on a men's officer at the guild:
if men's issues are apparently covered by existing officers, are there specific events for men who need assistance in these areas? i know at other universities that the womens n non-binary associations offer support/consciousness raising groups for men to discuss how toxic masculinity and other patriarchal structures negatively affect them and counter this.
i've only ever seen events that are women & non-binary people only - i completely agree that these are necessary, but have the guild considered organising a space for men to discuss these things? wouldnt have to be organised by wanba, could maybe be organised by welfare officer or disability officer.
forgive me if this already exists and i am unaware
i don't think it's helpful to shout at people whenever a men's officer is suggested. i disagree with the concept, because it suggests that the problems men face are the same as the systematic oppression faced by other minority groups.
however that doesn't mean that things aren't important and shouldn't be given a space within the guild.

The wellbeing/student services/pastoral care here is a joke. Been trying to get support for a while now and keep getting bounced around from contact to contact asked to fill out more and more forms and not being taken seriously. Just because I can eloquently express how I'm feeling does not mean I'm ok. I'm fed up of explaining my entire history and current stressors only to never the person again and be told to 'provide evidence' as if official documents from a mental health team are not evidence enough.
I'm sure once I manage to get through all the BS logistics involved I will receive ample support but this maze to get there perpetuates the idea that you will only be taken seriously if you're at crisis point. No I am not suicidal or at breaking point but I'm trying to preemptively get the support in place.

My flatmate never does her washing up, and even when I directly ask her to do it, she does it and then straight away replaces it with the next dirty stuff she's used. I really do not understand why people don't do their washing up- it's horrible for the rest of your flatmates, nothing is ever clean when you want to use it and it makes other people not want to cook food. Please please please if you don't do your washing up straight away, take a step back and think about how much it affects other people. Just do it, it literally takes 30 seconds to wash up a plate.

Carnival RAG, yes we raised £1000 for the charities but let’s be honest the night was absolute shite. We pay to go somewhere fun and we end up in Nottingham on a Monday night? The first bar credit where it’s due was cheap and good fun but no free drink that was promised , onto Yates’ and we get our free shot only once we’ve bought a drink? That wasn’t stipulated. We get kicked out half an hour early so onto the packed club we go where we’re told we’re leaving at 2:30, we leave at 1:30 aiming for a McDonald’s only to be told we’re not allowed as we wouldn’t be back to the bus’ in time only to be still sat STATIONARY at 2:20 waiting for people to come out the club? We’re hungry and pissed off, up your game, surely you got the message from the magnitude of the cheers that went up when we were told Nottingham was a detour and we were going else where only to be told no get off, Nottingham is the final destination, even though we could get the train there. Congrats on the money raised but we feel thoroughly fleeced and pissed off and if it wasn’t for charity we’d be asking for our money back. Yours sincerely Enigma 2018 participants xxx

I was the same, i had slept with a fair few guys but never had an orgasm. Whenever i masturbated it just fellt like it took more effort than it was worth (the longest i tried was 2 hours) and tbh it was just a little painfull.
I then realised i was gay but even the i could never cum (pretty sure that was because of internalised homophobia) but i did feel a little bit of a build up a couple of times.
I eventually wnded up going to the doctor about it and they changed my meds. Sex is much more enjoyable now, but i am only able to have an orgasm if i feel an emotional connection with the other person or if im high.
Hope this helped x

I just wanted to ask if anyone here (especially second year medics!) struggles with misophonia? I've been struggling with it for a couple of years and daily life is actually becoming tortuous. One of my triggers is certainly fabrics such as puffer jackets and for the last 2 lectures of the day someone wearing one was sat next to me and I wanted to cry and rip my hair out. Even just walking to uni is really hard. I've told my doctor about it but I don't think she really gets it and has just said the antidepressants I'm on might help but they just aren't. Please please if you struggle with it too (especially things like eating noises) can you like this so I can message you and find someone else to relate to!! Thanks xx

My best friend is 6 hours away. All I do I sleep, study, and occasionally eat. I’ve never been as cold or as hungry as I am here. I miss my undergrad university so much it hurts. If I didn’t need this Masters I’d have dropped out by now.

I have been going through some really bad stuff lately and I am seriously considering finally seeing someone about my mental health, but I don't know where to go. I don't think I am depressed, but I would really need some help from a specialist. The thing is that I don't think I could afford a psychologist but I don't know if only going to my GP would help. What is the best thing to do about it?

Been with a guy for a few years now. Healthy relationship, no arguments etc. I love him, of course. But I dont get that butterfly type feeling anymore. Is this because its a long term relationship, is this normal? Am I just 'used' to him or has something changed?

hey to the person who was feeling a dull kind of sadness. I don’t know how to make it go away and don’t understand the full details of the situation but I think these things just go on their own. I would try and fill your time up with things that distract you from it. It’s probably just the aftermath from a lot of things. Maybe try taking up a new hobby something you can do whenever you feel like that. I hope you feel better soon. ❤️❤️❤️

I’ve never been a lead role in any of their shows even though I’ve auditioned for them but I still think that everything they offer as a society is brilliant. People just have to accept that the same people get the lead roles because they’re good at it and that’s just fact. Yeah it can be disheartening to not get the part or not get in at all, but that’s just life and you just have to accept that there was a better person for the job.

Last year, my flatmates lipstick was balanced on the edge of a shelf above our toilet. After I finished pissing, the lipstick fell in. Well, I couldn’t fish it out could I? After all, she’d know it smelt funny next time she used it.
After some thought, I decided to flush said lipstick. I watched on as it disappeared into the abyss - RIP lipstick.
Until now, I’ve never spoken to anyone about this, and a year I’ve decided I need to know - can I be forgiven?

I'm a feminist and I was wanting to post something about international men's day, about how we should appreciate and encourage the men in our life, and why it's important to have an international men's day. About areas in life where men are disadvantaged and how we should work to change those things.
Problem is, I'm worried about getting shit from my ultra-feminist friends if I do it... Worried they'll say I must liked being groped and catcalled - and all the crap we women have to deal with from a shitty minority of men.
I believe so much in equality but I'm finding it increasingly hard to call myself a feminist when some of them just hate all men, giving the word 'feminist' a bad name...

Theresa May is one of the greatest Prime Ministers to hold office. She has written the perfect deal that fairly balances strong relations while still maintaining a clean exit. Yes there is a large bill and yes NI has to deal with a transition period, but you can't have everything. It is incredible people still hate her. The people left hating her are quite simply unreasonable - WE VOTED LEAVE, remain is off the cards and NO DEAL IS STUPID, so why people still wish for them is beyond me. Let's appreciate what we've got in front of us and begin healing our divided nation.

I'm not posting for advice or anything I just wanted to type this out and feel like I was being heard somewhere. My life been so shit for so long genuinely can't wait for this to all end, I've lost faith in my religion which was the only thing that kept me going. I feel like I've been numbed out and don't have any real interests or personality anymore, I'm just there totally empty and I can't even hold a conversation it seems. All the people I used to know have found their close friends and get along with their families, off on holidays and living uni life, and I'm still here and getting worse. Im just ridden with a guilt for things I can't control. I'm not diagnosed with anything I don't have depression, this is just my reality and I don't think being on meds will change my life. Honestly can't wait to be out of here I literally have nothing going for me but really if you have a good supportive home life, parents who you're close to, ambitions you aim for, and friends who care about you, know how lucky you are! Would die to have those things tbh but I'm just constantly running from who I am and my life. I just wanted to be happy and the typical second year uni student but sometimes life isn't like that for all of us I guess

I really like the theatre community at the guild, I think there are some great, talented people there. However I think they should be more inclusive of international students. It is said that accents are not problem and that everyone is welcomed yet most roles are filled by the same people and none of those people are international people with accents. I think that in the future they should work towards inclusivity of ALL students or else drop the act of “we are a big family, we accept everyone” because for now it is simply not true.

I know people are struggling with guild drama but it’s actually a lot friendlier than it seems. Auditions are scary and so even if you’re the best actor in the world you might not get it. I know some people who I thought would be perfect for roles not get in and seen other people do it and it makes perfect sense. Honestly the people are so much friendlier as well. It’s scary and people get so close, but there’s also some great people out there who really really try to make everyone feel included. It’s sad and stressful not getting into things, but guild drama people are in reality most of the time some of the best people you’ll meet.

I was really depressed through all of last year, pretty bad the year before last too. I went to counselling at first but only went to like two sessions. I was told I should go to my GP and I really didn’t want to do that. I wasn’t really ready to be diagnosed or to fully unload. I’m in a better position now and I don’t really want to talk about everything I have been going through again but I don’t know where else would be the starting point for therapy. I’m also scared I won’t be able to properly commit to the process yet because I don’t feel comfortable talking in intimate details about my home life. Should I go for it? Or is there no point until I’m ready to be fully open?

I don’t know about being cliquey but I do get really frustrated with GMTG sometimes. Auditioned for every show since year 1 and never been cast - which, in and of itself, is not a problem - but I always respond to the email asking for some kind of personal feedback and never hear anything back? I have nothing against the people in charge. They seem really nice, actually, but it’s really difficult to get communications :(
