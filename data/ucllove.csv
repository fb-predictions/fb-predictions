Some of you in the UK will never know what it’s like to be a Black person being stopped by the police for the fifth time - the way you feel anxious (what if you die? Who will see you? Who will hear you?) some of you will never be Asian and called scum or told to ‘go back to their own country’ or be a Muslim woman and be called a terrorist for wearing a hijab. Or be assaulted because you caused ‘corona’ This is a privilege - it’s a privilege to walk through security without getting stopped, to not feel anxious in a grocery store because someone thinks you are stealing. It’s a privilege to not feel like wanting to be white - to want desperately to have blue eyes like your classmates rubbing your skin so many times it’s starts to get red.
To my Eastern European friends, I hear you too - and that Xenophobia is just as wrong, and I want that to change too but right now Black people are dying needlessly.
Right now, rather than supporting the Black community which is so dearly suffering, so many of you are choosing instead to rant on an anonymous platform - and getting mad at us for speaking back. I don’t owe you anything, neither do our other admin. This is our page, we aren’t funded, if you don’t like it you can go and set up your page - we won’t tolerate it. This is a time for the community to come together, to recognise how each of us inhabit a space but that other people want to be safe in their spaces too - is it so wrong to fight for that?
You can use statistics, but you can’t change that fear of ending up dead while innocent. You can love hip hop and the Harlem Renaissance, read books by Malorie Blackman, but can’t even NOT question what your Black friends go through?
Having a platform is always about trying to keep a safe space for the UCL community - but for our Black friends and family (alongside other POC) it isn’t right now. Do you see how many tears you're causing behind a computer screen? How you too are contributing to making people feel unsafe at UCL? Are you happy? Does it make you feel good to be angry? Does it feel like you have control?
UCL i love you, but learn to do better.
Until then, why tolerate ignorance?
Sincerely, the people you have called:

Protagonistul romanului, Ion, se află în centrul tuturor conflictelor; tot universul rural al Pripasului intră în relaţie cu Ion (în plan afectiv el este legat de soarta Anei şi a Floricăi; conflictele exterioare cu Vasile Baciu şi George Bulbuc îl au în prim- plan, în raporturile cu intelectualii-autorităţi rurale-, preotul şi învăţătorul, Ion este pionul central).
Tânărul erou, individualizat în mod remarcabil de Liviu Rebreanu, reprezintă tipul generic al ţăranului român/ ardelean.
În caracterizarea directă, făcută de autor, se precizează că Ion a fost “cel mai iubit elev al învăţătorului Herdelea”, care a insistat pe lângă tatăl lui, Alexandru Glanetaşu să-l trimită la şcoala din Armadia, “să-l facă domn”. Strădania învăţătorului a dus la înscrierea fără taxă, “fiindcă băiatul era silitor şi cuminte”. Dar Ion a renunţat la şcoală, fiind pasionat de muncile câmpului şi vrând “să fie veşnic însoţit cu pământul”. Într-adevăr, tânărul ţăran este gospodar, “iute şi harnic ca mă-sa”, Zenobia.
Protagonistul este caracterizat de celelalte personaje, în maniera pluriperspectivistă: Vasile Baciu care îl socoteşte: “hoţ, tâlhar, sărăntoc şi fleandură”. Herdelea, care îl crede muncitor şi harnic; Belciug, care îl numeşte “bătăuş şi stricat”, în urma bătăii cu George.
Ion este caracterizat indirect, prin faptele, gesturile, atitudinile, reacţiile sale, manifestate în anumite împrejurări. Tot timpul este sfâşiat de două pasiuni: una pentru frumoasa Florica, alta pentru pământurile Anei.
Ion este conturat prin tehnica basoreliefului, fapt care face ca el să se evidenţieze pe toata întinderea romanului, ca un ţăran pe care iubirea pământului îi “era drag ca ochii din cap”.
Înzestrat cu voinţă, ambiţie şi orgoliu, cu un temperament controlat de instinctele primare, foarte hotărât şi perseverent în atingerea scopului sau, Ion este un tip isteţ, viclean, care îşi stabileşte un plan prin care să ajungă în posesia averii lui Baciu.
Primul pas îi este sugerat în discuţia cu Titu, fiul învăţătorului, care, întrebat de Ion, cum să procedeze pentru a-l determina pe Vasile Baciu să i-o dea pe Ana, îl sfătuieşte: “Trebuie să-l sileşti!” Vorbele acestea sunt suficiente pentru tânărul ţăran, care profita de dragostea Anei pentru el, o seduce, o lasă însărcinată şi astfel Baciu este silit să accepte căsătoria fetei lui cu “sărăntocul” satului.
Dupa nuntă, Ion se comportă cu Ana rece, distant, violent, brutal; e semeţ şi sfidător când negociază averea cu Vasile Baciu, pe care, în cele din urmă, după mai multe tergiversări,îl aduce în faţa notarului, la care, după cum afirmă acesta, a venit bogat şi de la care pleacă, “cerşetor”.
Mediul social în care trăieşte Ion este un factor modelator asupra eroului, deoarece acesta repetă într-o oarecare masură metoda socrului său şi dobândeşte averea prin căsătorie.
Dar Vasile Baciu şi-a iubit nevasta, pe când Ion face din Ana o victimă a patimii sale nestăvilite, a violenţei şi nepăsării sale.
Ion reprezintă tipul realist din două motive: social, este ţăranul care vrea pământul pentru a fi respectat în comunitate; moral, este un arivist care îşi atinge scopul, fără scrupule, folosind femeia ca mijloc de parvenire.
Eroul evoluează dinspre tipic spre atipic, având o individualitate pregnantă, caracterizată de forţa pe care o declanşează în lupta cu un destin potrivnic, din dorinţa puternică de a-şi găsi în societate locul pe care crede că îl merită.
Tipologia personajului principal este reliefată în relaţiile cu celelalte personaje, prin tehnica contrapunctului. De pildă, adversarul său, George Bulbuc, cu care se află în antiteză, este bogat, dorit ca ginere de Vasile Baciu, dar lipsit de personalitate, moale, incapabil s-o cucerească pe Ana şi mulţumindu-se cu Florica şi sărăcia ei.
Ana, personajul feminin, victima tragică a lui Ion, este construită tot prin tehnica contrapunctului, prin antiteză cu Florica. Ana este bogată, dar urâtă-Florica este frumoasă şi săracă.
Fiica lui Baciu este personaj de mare complexitate psihologică: orfană de mică, lipsită de afecţiunea mamei, ea creşte sub autoritatea paternă şi-şi îndreaptă dragostea sinceră către Ion.
În ochii tatălui şi bărbatului ei, femeia nu este decât o “marfă”, un pretext pentru a negocia averea.
În secvenţa în care se întâlnesc cele două familii, Glanetaşu şi Baciu, în prezenţa preotului care urmărea împăcarea lor, Ana nu este luată în seamă, este tratată ca un obiect, motiv de suferinţă şi durere.
Simetria dintre cele două femei din viaţa lui Ion poate fi ilustrată şi de faptul că, în vreme ce Ana n-a avut parte de caldura sufletească a mamei, Florica, fiind orfană de tată, nu s-a bucurat de protecţia acestuia.
Ana este personajul care-şi înţelege condiţia, dar care nu poate lupta împotriva destinului său. Îndrăgostită de Ion, îl respinge pe George Bulbuc, cel menit să o aibă de soţie, pentru că e dorit de Baciu şi pentru că e bogat.
Orbită de pasiunea pentru Ion, se lasă amăgită de acesta, manifestându-şi slăbiciunea, căzând în capcana şi apoi trăindu-şi calvarul: maltratările soţului şi ale tatălui. Încă din seara nunţii citise în ochii lui Ion iubirea acestuia pentru Florica pe care o dansa, iar suferinţa avea să i se amplifice, în timp , dându-şi seama că bărbatul ei o tratează cu dispreţ, cu silă, în batjocură, fără respect.
Ea dă naştere copilului, lui Petrişor, pe câmp, sub un măr, asistată fiind de soacra sa, Zenobia, scenă de mare emoţie artistică, similară cu aceea care povesteşte de celebra eroina Tess şi venirea pe lume a copilului ei.
Dar faptul că are un băiat, că a devenit mamă, nu o schimbă pe Ana. Durerea ei sufletească e prea adâncă, slăbiciunea ei pentru Ion-prea mare, caracterul ei- prea fragil, încât găseşte soluţia de a ieşi din cercul suferinţei: copiază gestul sinucigaşului Avrum, se spânzură în grajd, pentru a pune capăt calvarului său, pentru a se elibera din strânsoarea unei pasiuni imposibile, nefericite.
Moartea Anei provoacă însă destinul lui Ion, principalul vinovat moral pentru dispariţia femeii, întrucât protagonistul se întoarce la prima dragoste, consecinţa faptei fiind de aşteptat: moartea violentă, produsă de eternul său rival.
Prin urmare, în opinia mea, Liviu Rebreanu a reuşit cu succes şi în mod original să creeze un univers ficţional, oferindu-i cititorului iluzia verosimilităţii, a veridicităţii.
A realizat un personaj realist cu o psihologie bine individualizată, Ion, în jurul căruia gravitează alte personaje, masculine şi feminine, de asemenea ilustrative pentru definirea clasei sociale din care fac parte, ţărănimea sau intelectualitatea satului. Lui Ion i se opune, ca personaj literar, Ilie Moromete, fire contemplativă şi ironică, “cel din urmă ţăran” (Nicolae Manolescu).","#UCLove71006

Prin urmare, în opinia mea, Liviu Rebreanu a reuşit cu succes şi în mod original să creeze un univers ficţional, oferindu-i cititorului iluzia verosimilităţii, a veridicităţii.
A realizat un personaj realist cu o psihologie bine individualizată, Ion, în jurul căruia gravitează alte personaje, masculine şi feminine, de asemenea ilustrative pentru definirea clasei sociale din care fac parte, ţărănimea sau intelectualitatea satului. Lui Ion i se opune, ca personaj literar, Ilie Moromete, fire contemplativă şi ironică, “cel din urmă ţăran” (Nicolae Manolescu).",,1592134929,,,25,63,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2798246260286920&id=1310505995727628,

I know people have been talking about RUMSBC and their lack of diversity and I do agree they need to work on their image. They’re talked about a lot in a negative way by other clubs for a reason. However I think another club that needs to address a sense of elitism is RUMSHC both men’s and women’s. Whilst these clubs are more ethnically diverse it is true that a lot of the members have come from private schools and so there is a social class barrier. I think this comes across during drinking events and the expensive prices. I think a lot of clubs, but especially HC and BC have expensive membership and kit prices and this does create a class barrier. It may not be the intention but it does have its consequences. Whilst rowing may be considered an elitist sport anyway, having to pay something like £60/80 for membership followed by a lot more for all the dinners and unisuits is going to set limitations for a lot of people. The same can be said for hockey but perhaps to slightly less of a degree. It’s sad because being part of these clubs can create a huge sense of community but I think in previous years the community had been curated by who can afford it.
I think this is less of a case for clubs like RUMSFC, RUMS Netball, tennis etc who are all ethnically and socially diverse. I think it’s just worth pointing out that even though HC and BC are two of the biggest clubs, you would think they would be more accessible.","#UCLove71002

Some people really need to pull their heads out of their asses. It makes me sick that you can blatantly disregard all of the hard work people put into a project, a production, or a show, and not credit them for it. I've watched this happen all of this year, and I'm so sick of it. Power-hungry bunch of backstabbing snakes. And the fact that you have the audacity to twist the truth to fit your narrative and your opinion of the world is just appaling. I don't care if you're a committee member, or a contributor, or a cast member, for all I care, you can be the fucking Pope, it doesn't give you the right to abuse the power you've been given to suit your own selfish needs. You deny and omit the contributions of so many people that have worked so hard on these events and projects, and for what!? Your own personal satisfaction? So that you can be perceived as ""the top of the food chain?"" What gives you the right to screw with people's lives like this?
Yes, this is very much aimed at particular people in a particular society, although I'm sure it happens in other societies and departments/research groups as well.","#UCLove70999

I wrote #UCLove70823, the post about white privilege. I am glad that a lot of people read it and liked it. I originally planned to only write one post, almost as a vent towards some UCLove posts and comments I had seen. However after reading some of the comments on my post and other recent UCLove posts I felt the need to respond to further elaborate one some of the stuff I had written.
Firstly, one of the most common points made recently is how white privilege applies to Eastern European and Slavic countries. As a person who has not lived there nor particularly learnt about the history in that region, I'm not going to pretend to know the struggles they go through. However, I will reiterate a point I made in my original post. No one has ever said that all white people have an easy life. That is not what white privilege means. It does not mean you are by definition always privileged. What it means more than anything, is that you are MORE privileged than a minority in the same conditions as you. So in the context of the Eastern European/Slavic/Balkan countries, it means if you are a white person from that region and you have a neighbour who is black, you and your neighbour would experience the same discrimination, but your neighbour will experience even more discrimination because of their skin colour. This discrimination may be from locals from that country (let's not pretend that there's no racism in Eastern European countries btw). This discrimination may be from other people. Wherever you and your neighbour go, you neighbour has a higher chance to be discriminated because of their skin colour.
Once again, white privilege isn't about how if you are white you are instantly going to be rich, have a great discrimination-free life and die peacefully. It means that compared to POC, who is in a similar social, political and economic situation as a white person, they will be disadvantaged compared to you. Quite simply, if you recognise there is racism, then you should acknowledge white privilege. A part of white privilege is the fact that you are much less likely to experience discriminate because of your skin colour.
Secondly, there is no shame in having white privilege. No one is shaming you for having white privileges. What people are shaming you for is your ignorance. Some of you deny your white privilege, some of you don't even try to learn and read about racial issues, some of you only acknowledge you privilege and then stop there. What you should do is learn. Listen to what people have to say. There is so much on the internet about all of this. Read it. Educate yourself. Then you should use your privilege. Use your privilege to speak out. Go protest, go educate your friends and family, go stand up for people of colour. There are so many times that POCs have to stand up for themselves in front of an audience which is primarily ignorant. Personally, I have been in situations where people have asked me if saying _____ was racist. What they said would make me highly uncomfortable, but because there was no one to back me up and because I was afraid to be ridiculed or mocked for not being able to take a joke or for being easily ""triggered"", I had to say it wasn't. Similarly there are times where I am trying to explain things to my friends and they dismiss what I say because they think I'm overreacting or I'm over-sensitive. As a minority, we will often find ourselves in a situation where we are talking to an audience (whether it be friends or strangers) that is a white majority. We will often find that no matter what we say, it falls on deaf ears. We are called snowflakes or angry, we are dismissed, we are laughed out. What you can do with your white privilege is help to prevent this.
Lastly, in response to the first comment on my original post. Where a non-white, first generation, state school attending immigrant shares their views on this. Whether they meant it or not, their comment was incredibly dismissive of what I had written. Their comment to me seemed like they were saying because they did not have any issues, white privilege doesn't exist. Well as a non-white, first generation, public school attending immigrant myself, I was bullied. I was bullied verbally and physically. Everyday for 7 years, I was not allowed to forget that I wasn't white and that I didn't belong. I was scared everyday to do the simplest of things. I practically grew up here, I attended primary school and one year of secondary school in the UK before I finally decided I didn't want to be bullied everyday anymore. I begged my parents to let me go back to Hong Kong.
Even now my parents are scared for me to return to London in September. After Covid-19, they think that racism towards people who look Chinese will be much worse than before. They remind me about Jonathan Mok, who was the Singaporean student who got beat up on Oxford Street at the start of the Coronavirus. I wish I could convince them that I'll be safe but I'm not 100% sure of that myself.
I have not included all the specifics of what happened to me and how I was bullied. But the fact that I feel the need to prove to anyone that racism exists is fucked up. White privilege is literally defined as the fact that white people have a social advantage that POCs in the same social, economical and political do not have. If there is racism, there is white privilege.
If you ask me if I'm privileged or not, I would say yes I am. Compared to some people in this world, I am incredibly privileged. I have shelter, food and clothes. I'm at one of the best universities in the world. I am happy to be where I am. But my journey has been so much harder than if I was white. That is what white privilege is.","#UCLove70996

Little Britain and Come Fly With Me are racist as fuck, but are products of their time, and we shouldn’t forget how the past societies used to perceive people. If we pretend this never happened, we have nothing to move on from and use as evidence of a racist past.

As a Chinese, I just feel a bit low when I get back home. When I bring up a political issue in a family/friends discussion, very often I make the people I love feel uncomfortable. And I can understand it, it's normal. There's this ghost of censorship that haunts us- in most cases it doesn't get you, but you know it could. And that's sad.
Also, I wouldn't be surprised if some people in China confuse government with people, due to a lack of (or perhaps excessive) education. That's why a lot of people laugh at us, but I really think they're the victims too. It's a clever trick.

Honest question here, just trying to understand the complex matter of destroying statues, renaming street names etc.
In the case of statues depicting racist people, why can't we simply displace them to museums instead of straight up destroying them? Can't we archive what will be seen as interesting historical artifacts in the future, without plainly destroying them? Museums can always indicate what these people did and how bad their actions were with regards to specific groups of people, but I believe it would still be interesting to keep these as a memory of the racist mentality of some influential people in the context of their era, and show the role they played in destroying so many lives.
What would the argument be to simply destroy a historical artifact, as controversial as it is, instead of keeping it as a memory of a horrible past in a museum where it belongs?
Moreover, with concerning street names and notable city places, not only with regards to racist people but every time a city replaces a name with another, wouldn't it be justified to indicate the past name(s) of such a place underneath the plaque or whatever? Straight up renaming such things whilst forcing the forgetfulness of people can lead to dangerous paths like trying to rewrite history in order to influence the memory that we have of such eras.
I hope this will create interesting and constructive discussions, and will help me understand such a debate a bit more. Thanks :)","#UCLove70972

A reply to the following comment (that I will not post publicly because I try to keep my social media apolitical. Sorry!)
'Doesnt the fact that people are now able to protest because of the pandemic and its effect on jobs say more about the role capitalism plays in suppressing grassroots movements than about those people's genuine desire to participate in the movement? Jobs arent always about 'financial gain', for a lot of us they're about survival'
Two questions
• Can people not protest on weekends in capitalist societies? When they're not working? And if they value a few free weekends more than the cause.. then do they care THAT much about the cause?
• In a society different to our current capitalism (one which is hard to define as I acknowledge there are many variants) surely people would still need to work? People wouldn't just be able to take the weeks off work to protest all the time?
Anyway sorry. I will leave that there. Appreciate the response. Unfortunately I want to keep my Facebook feed apolitical.","#UCLove70958

Because there have been so many negative experiences with BAME students feeling kinda left out from societies, I'd like to share my positive experiences too I guess just to show there are good societies too.
I'm Chinese, and I've joined two sports societies (it seems sports socs are really the issue atm idk), and I've just finished my second year. (Not gonna say which ones they are because you'd really easily be able to tell who I am, unless people really want me to reveal all). One of them is a very diverse society, with loads of white, asian, east asian, whatever you name it students. There's also loads of LGBT peeps as well, and I've made lots of really good friends there. The social side of this society is fabulous.
The second society is a UOL one and it's my main competitive sporting society. It's a sport more traditionally known for being a lot whiter. In my first year, whenever I went to any competitions around the UK there would only ever be two non-white students - me and an HK guy from Imperial. And that's if Imperial even decided to go to that event. Despite this though, I never felt outcast when in London due to my race or anything like that. It does help though that actually even though everyone else was white, there were loads of international students which helped with diversity. I managed to make my way onto committee this year and next year, and I never felt that I had to work extra hard for that position or anything, I just so happened to be most qualified for that position.
I guess what I'm saying is there is always hope about finding a wholesome, inclusive society, but you probably already knew that. It's just a case of getting lucky and finding something that's right for you. Should you have to get lucky to find a good soc? No, every society should be as welcoming as possible but please remember these societies are run by 18-21 year olds, barely adults and they are trying their best I promise.
Either way, that's just my experience. Take what you want from it. I just hope that everyone can find something right for them as easily as I did.","#UCLove70957

Lol I really don’t get it when people link the number of sexual partners to ‘morality’. How does your body count even remotely have any correlation with your sense of right and wrong? Fair play if you’re uncomfortable being with someone who’s slept with a lot more people than you but don’t put it down to having ‘superior morals’. Morality surely can’t be that superficial.","#UCLove70956

Am I a racist?
If i am walking home alone in camden at night and I see a group of people on a street corner I unconsciously have a prejudice against them based on the colour of their skin. If that group were black I would be more inclined to cross the road to avoid them than if they were Asian or white. Other factors take precident over the skin colour such as how they act and what clothing they are wearing ect. But this scenario assumes they are wearing the same clothes and acting the same.
(I see similarilites in the way a woman might be more inclined to cross the road if the person on the corner was a man a opposed to a woman, it's a the body's natural instinct to avoid danger)
For some context I have been attacked once and attempted to be mugged on three other occasions whilst at UCL. Only one out of the approx 10 people involved in all of these incidents was white, the remaining 9 were black (even though 1/8 in london are black).
I ask this question, am I a racist? because alot of white people are posting on social media currently with support for the cause, however I believe many of my friends and people I know would do the same thing given the circumstances. After all our body is trying to stay alive and using everything its learnt subconsciously to avoid danger. I believe the solution to these prejudices is education and equal opportunities for all to avoid a situation. I have never insulted anyone based on the colour of their skin or treated my friends differently based on this, I believe its turning the prejudices into actions that directly affect the person to be racist. But on the other hand, someone crossing the road based on the colour of my skin would affect me!
I find it hard to talk to my nonce white friends about this as I dont want to cause them harm, the tone of lots of instagram stories ect prevent this kind of dialogue.

I originally wanted to reply to a post but can't find it now - a person from an ethnic minority saying that they have been at UCL all year and UCL is not racist. As someone who has been at UCL for 5+ years - I can assure you it is.
Take a look at sports teams and their diversity. How many BAME students do you think join sports like rowing, hockey, athletics? The answer is not a lot. These teams do nothing to change that, and as someone who has tried to join those teams, I have been left out because I wasn't white and didn't go to an elite private school in Kent. Their sports night chants even incorporate 'zulu warriors' to get a pint down.
Take a look at their curriculum, especially for history. Does it paint an accurate picture of British history and colonisation? The answer is no. That is why students have launched a 'decolonise the curriculum' campaign.
Take a look at their incoming students, especially for medicine. I can assure you that black students are a rarity in UCL medical school. They are also more likely to fail practical exams (OSCE's). Finally, in medical school, there is no condition taught with regards to black skin (except jaundice lol). Every picture we have learned from has white skin because that is the default right? There is a petition to improve representation of skin conditions in the curriculum.
UCL is not innocent. The stories of out right racism are few in number sure. Institutional racism and bias is a lot harder to see and appreciate. And that is where UCL can improve.","#UCLove70942

Being aggressive to these people because they don’t understand their “white privilege” is just not an intelligent strategy. Shutting people up and telling them “go educate yourself” is not gonna help the BLM causes nor any social justice cause. It does the opposite, even if you have good intentions.

Does it bother anyone - particularly international students that are minorities in their own country to be asked “where are you really from?” It’s a weird situation for me as a Canadian that is of mixed Native heritage - people have a hard time believing that I am Canadian because I’m not white - and when I explain my origins, I get replies like “oh so like you’re a redskin, red indian/American Indian” - which are offensive and backdated terms. I can’t explain the number of times over my years in London I’ve seen people dressed as Native Americans and their faces painted in Halloween.
I feel like most people I come across at Uni have very little awareness about Native American culture. And now that we’re addressing issues with our colonial past, I think it’s important that everyone (particularly the British and French) to learn about the colonial history of North America & the impacts of settler colonialism on our lands.
And after hundreds of years of systemic oppression and outright genocide, our rights are still being infringed upon. Our communities have been subject to untold police brutality - 30% of people shot to death in Canada are native compared to a population of 5%.
I would urge all those who care, to take some time to research about our movement against the 190km of illegal LNG pipelines currently under construction without our consent through the Wetsuweten territory which is will poison our waters and destroy our environment. This violence is being done in your name! using the false justification that the Wetsuweten nation is a part of Crown Land owned by the British Monarch and therefore okay to exploit - when our territory was never conquered and no treaties were ever signed.

Does anyone think these protests in London would be happening if people had jobs to go to? Or would these protesters care more about their own financial gain than the cause itself? Because I'm spotting some paper-thin activism over here.
With that said, at least this jobless period has given them the time off to protest some noble causes (albeit extremely selfishly considering the lives it'll end up taking when we get a second wave). Slave trader statues should not exist and racism should be eradicated.
But, as someone supportive of the cause, I'm just curious to hear what you guys think about these details.","#UCLove70932

In the light of Pride Month, Hindu philosophy provides a unique perspective on the LGBTQ+ community. We identify with our body and mind but according to the Upanishads, this is not who we are. They teach us that while the body and mind form our apparent identity, our essential identity is the Self, consciousness that is free from identity and witnesses all. They propose that the Ātman (the Self) - the unchanging aspect of an individual - inhabits the bodies of all beings. The Ātman is beyond the notions of gender and sexuality. These aspects are of the body and the mind. The theory of reincarnation offers an explanation to the emergence of a variety of genders and sexual preferences. From one life to the next, one acquires inclinations, desires and characteristics that can be expressed in future lives. As a result, individuals across the spectrums of gender and sexuality are seen in society.","#UCLove70931

We need to stop looking to politics to bring about any change for black people in the US and UK, it is not a matter of right and left.
Can't help but get triggered when people use BLM as a way to support labour or conservatives - lacks any balance and lacks any historical support that change will happen.
Do not feed into the current ""culture war"" that people like Trump but also the socialist governments are perpetuating.
The left’s stance towards the Black Lives Matter resurgence is that dignified peaceful protests must be encouraged, but there should be no extremist destructive excesses and looting. In some elementary sense that is right, of course, but it misses the true meaning of violent excess: a reaction to the fact that liberal, peaceful and gradual political change has not worked and systemic racism persists in the US.
What emerges in violent protest is an anger that cannot be adequately represented in our political space.
This is also why so many representatives of the establishment, not only liberals but also conservatives, are openly critical of Trump’s aggressive stance towards the protesters. The establishment desperately wants to channel protests into the coordinates of the eternal “struggle against racism”, one of liberalism’s endless tasks.
They are ready to admit that we didn’t do enough, that there is a long and difficult work ahead, just to prevent a quick radicalization of the protests, not towards even more violence but their transformation into an autonomous political movement with a platform clearly demarcated from the liberal establishment.
Violent protests are the return of the repressed of our liberal societies; a symptom which enacts what cannot be formulated in the vocabulary of liberal multiculturalism.
Usually, we accuse people of just speaking, instead of doing something. These protests are the exact opposite: people act violently because they don’t have the words to express their grievance within our political structure.
Violence is awful but we must acknowledge why people are acting this way first. We must find an equally impactful but peaceful way to show discontent for the current establishment through which systematic racism takes place, then start over again with a new one.","#UCLove70929

My parents’ income is roughly £40k, and my first year in London costed them more than £20k, ie more than 50% of their income. Honestly, I don’t know how I can justify them this price for 9 contact hours pw (I’m in a BA), UCL Careers almost useless when I’m not in England, the campus probably half closed next year.

I've seen so much whataboutism, hypocrisy and straw man arguments it's actually frustrating to think these are the people I share lectures, seminars, and labs with. Oof
Some of these posts on UCLove are a precise example of the difference between book smarts vs. street smarts (or emotional intelligence)... some of y'all are only equipped with the former and it shows.

I do really hope RUMSBC improve as a place for POC in the future. In the past the committee had not been very diverse and there’s a high number of POC who join the club as freshers and leave after one year. I understand they boast that they’re one of the biggest clubs in RUMS by numbers but when you actually look at the club they’re very exclusive, and very cliquey. I think previous comments about the club and social class do also ring true. I hope they become more self aware.","#UCLove70896

I'm a disabled gay woman and I have faced my fair share of discrimination on that front, but you know what? I still have white priveledge and have massively benefitted from it. You can be oppressed and still have white priveledge. The fact is I'm never going to face discrimination over the colour of my skin. When I make applications for further education or internships etc I am often worried about being turned down or overlooked because of the accommodations I need but I am never worried that someone will throw aside my cv as soon as they read my name.
In terms of intersectionality, on a case by case basis I'm sure you can find examples where one black person is more priveledged than a white person. But that is not the point! It's about aggregate, its about an entire population! If we just focus on ableism for a sec, so many conditions are underdiagnosed in black people and other poc and their concerns are ignored by healthcare professionals. The finding that the disproportionate effect of covid on BAME is down to socioeconomic factors rather than genetics isnt proof that racism dowsnt exist, its proof that BAME are disproportionately represented in lower income deciles. And unless you wanna believe that BAME are on average less productive or skilled or whatever than whites (which is, you know, racist) than you have to accept that this means they face disadvantages in terms of education and employment. My private school was overwhelmingly white, as are many, and private school educated children are over represented in university ranks (and in government and boardrooms). So you could argue I'm privileged because I went to a private school (which of course I am) but why did I go? Because my parents could afford it - whilst i should imagine unconscious bias and perhaps even outright discrimination plays a part in my school's acceptance rates, it cant explain the entirety of the under representation.
The way I see it, my whiteness isnt something to be guilty about- that helps no one. But it is my responsibility to recognise where I am advantaged unfairly and to educate myself on the issues. It is my responsibility to make sure I dont perpetuate stereotypes and to challenge my inner unconscious bias (because we all have it). You know what it's not even that hard! Just listen to your BAME peers, dont dismiss their struggles because you personally havent seen racism and therefore it cant be real, do what you can to helpn, be that donating to causes if you can afford to, signing petitions, writing to your MP, or more personally, standing up and calling out racism when you see it. If your friend makes a racist joke (or an ableist, homophobic, sexist etc. Joke for that matter) call them out on it. If your classmate feels alienated by studying in a building named after a eugenicist, let UCL know that it isnt right. If you need any more ideas, do some googling.
My last word on the matter: this isnt the oppression Olympics! Maybe some people have it worse but right now the fight is Black Lives Matter!
Happy pride, I have my rights thanks to black trans women.","#UCLove70895

It’s sad to say, but the cat is really out the bag with the whole racism thing in this country. Different people and cultures just seem to always end up hating living alongside each other. We saw it in the Middle East when the British drew shitty borders, as well as in Rwanda, Bangladesh and of course Germany. Is this inevitable? Is it human nature?
These issues don’t seem to be so prevalent in ethnically and culturally homogenous countries. You don’t see any innocent men killed by racist police in Japan. You don’t hear of many Neo-fascist hate groups in South Korea, or Argentina. Are multiracial western societies doomed to a future of racial oppression and hatred? Was large scale immigration a mistake? I’d be interested to hear what people think about this.
History seems to repeat itself, and with governments across the western world becoming more right wing I can only see things getting more extreme. I was born in England but I’m genuinely considering moving to my country of origin (which has improved a lot since my grandparents left it) to escape this bitter society 😅","#UCLove70894

Hey, no offence. But Don’t you think that your behaviour is selfish and inconsiderate to your friend and her bf? She deserves to have her stable and committed love for a longer period to hopefully make her family with her man. Your behaviour is nothing other than intervening her relationship and sticking around her by taking advantage of ‘the friend frame between guys and girls’. If you were a real just friend, then when your female friend has a bf, don’t contact her necessarily. Rather refrain from contacting. Just pray for her to live well, which is a righteous gesture. Your needs of wanting her at least as a friend (in your term) cannot be a justification to intervene them. Please remember that you are also a man. Do fair play for her bf and her. Behave with integrity.
Believe in yourself. Live your life. A life long friend will come to your life. The person could be your friend or your future partner. Just develop yourself and be more mature to be with the person for you. You can do it if you want to be better","#UCLove70894

I've seen the pain and divide making the rounds in those difficult times and I hope that every person who is in pain due to oppression, prejudice, lockdown or loneliness finds a bit of solace. But I felt the need to reach out to this community for help and advice.
I have been trying to educate myself and contribute as much as I can to the causes in the recent times. However, I am struggling with massive guilt due to the pain and divide currently in the world. I am looking at the privilege I've had in life and while I've suffered from people being prejudiced against me I cannot imagine the pain minorities face in the world. I admire the strength and passion of all people fighting and standing against prejudice in these times. However, I cannot help but feeling like I'm a bad human being for not being more involved, for not doing more to ease the pain I see and I feel guilty in my own skin.
I suffer from diagnosed social anxiety and I have my support group and friends. But this does affect how I interact with the world. I don't post online, I can't go to mass gatherings and I can't do much but offer one on one support.
So I want to ask those people that are in pain, what could someone like me do to help you ? What do you need and what makes you feel listened to and supported ?","#UCLove70893

I’m really sick and tired of the ignorance a lot of people toward someone with brown skin colour.
They automatically assume that You’re Indian or Bangladeshi.
Even though British I’m actually ethnically mixed; 1/3 Arab, Afghani and also Iranian.
But because I have more melanin in my skin tone, every assumes that I’m Indian. What’s even more annoying is when I tell them what my real ethnicity is they still try to persuade me that I don’t look like the aforementioned ethnicity of the countries I’ve mentioned. That is so rude and ignorant.
I just thought that this is just my experience anyway.
Unfortunately I’ve come across people who have experienced very similar ignorant attitudes.
Dear Mr & Miss ignorant I paint everyone with the same brunch,
You do realise that there are other ethnicities we could belong to for example:
Middle Eastern, Israeli, Arab, Iranian, Turkey, North African Arab countries too, South American; Brazilian, Colombian, Central Asian; Mongolia, Kyrgyz, Uzbekistan, Afghani, South East Asian; Indonesian, Burmese, Thai, Malaysian, Philippines, Sri Lankan, Nepalese etc

Just please educate yourselves and STOP judging everyone with an ignorant colonial mindset, not everyone is “Indian or Bangladeshi”.

When artefacts of the past: statues, films, place names etc. make us feel uncomfortable, it is natural to want to remove them from our modern society. Yet while individuals like Edward Colston are indefensibly linked with slavery and few will regret his statue’s removal, doing so sets a dangerous precedent for how the past is to be treated.
Thousands of British historical artefacts are to differing extents tied not just to slavery but to a multitude of other practices that are considered wrong when judged against modern values and standards. Removing all these traces of the past is not just impractical but damaging to our cultural heritage.
Therefore, instead of seeking to erase the aspects of our history we find troubling, the focus should instead be on changing the understanding of historical monuments so that they are no longer celebrations of racist individuals and practices but timely reminders of the uncomfortable aspects of the past that we are still striving to escape.","#UCLove70890

This is a reply to the person who commented on #UCLove70823 with their own experience as a non-white person in the UK. I want to start by saying thank you for sharing your own personal experience - I appreciate that. However, although you may not have faced any particular overt racism yourself, I want to discuss some other aspects.
Firstly, not all racism is ‘overt’. For anyone living in a racialized society, systematic racism can be both conscious and subconscious. For example, if you have an African or Asian sounding surname, statistics show that you need to send out about twice as many job applications as those with a traditionally English sounding surname, just to get an interview. An interviewer may not be consciously aware of how they treat such names, but it still happens… this is still systematic racism.
Secondly, there are so many examples to demonstrate the ongoing mistreatment of BME people. The majority of the victims of the Grenfell incident were BME. They were living there because of the systematic racism in our society (i.e. are given lower paid jobs and so live in relatively poorer areas etc.). Then, because of the colour of their skin, they received little justice and support. Furthermore, the fact that white people have actively made fake posts about the recent BLM protests shows ongoing racism in this society. I have seen photos of white police officers with multiple injuries with captions like ‘this was done by black BLM protesters… white lives matter!’ when actually, that photo was taken during EDL protests in 2018 (i.e. those injuries were inflicted by another white person). I can go on and on… what about the lack of education about the oppression of black people in schools? Personally, I had only just found out about Churchill’s violently racist outlook (and the causing of a huge genocide in Bengali). Whilst I still look up to all those brave people who fought in that war (and I always will be so thankful), it is hypocritical to not be taught about the Bengali concentration camps that Churchill himself set up. What about the the tragic death of the Somali schoolgirl Shukri Abdi? Her death was ruled as suicide, despite allegations that “another child forced her to get into the water and later ‘laughed for two minutes while she died"" because she couldn’t swim.
Regarding my own experiences, my uncle told me the other day that black people are at fault because ‘black on black is the worst crime and white people killing black people doesn't matter’. My white aunt even used the N word in front of me the other day, and she has been educated at university! I can go on… my black colleague received multiple messages after the BLM protests, calling her a ‘dirty monkey’. There are smaller, more subtler cases of racism that I have witnessed myself. When I was in sixth form, one of my black friends was told by a white guy in our school that “you look good for a black girl”.
We cannot deny that racism does not exist in the UK. It goes on everyday - sometimes it is so normalised and subconscious that it just goes undetected. Yes, the racism experienced here may be different than the police brutality in the US (for instance, gun laws are different here), but UK prisons are currently holding a larger proportion of BME youths than America.
Also, I’d like to point out that as a white person, I do not feel personal guilt for the actions of my ancestors, but what I do feel guilty for is not having previously made the effort to stand up to racism that I see everyday and to have not previously made a huge effort to learn about the BLM movement and white privilege etc. I also do not think that discussions on here about white privilege is not telling BME students “how poor and oppressed they are”, but it is rather raising awareness about what white privilege is and that it exists. Discussions like this are needed if change is going to happen.

Considering we live in a system where what you earn is equivalent to your societal value, my seeming inability to match the work ethic of the majority of other people logically makes me worthless. I actually feel so done.
Then you have the fact that the economy is slowly falling apart, racial tensions are growing, the planet is dying and right wing nationalism is on the rise globally, what actually is the point anymore? Does anyone actually feel positive about the future?","#UCLove70871

Selling summary notes from last year for £20! Basically all the non-design modules, ie. Planning Systems/Planning History/Intro to Management/Beyond Cities. I got 75-85 for all these modules last year where there was either an essay or written examination component.
Each of them are divided by theme in a pdf document, and go beyond the taught material to include stuff from readings that boost your understanding/also really good for essays. Thought they would be a useful guide for anyone needing to write their capstone assessment and consolidate their understanding for next year, or for incoming freshers who want a head start given how confusing online learning can be.
Comment here if you are interested, and I will message you. Happy to share a few pages from a unit before buying.","#UCLove70868

I think a large part of the misunderstanding in these white privilege arguments stems from the terminology. Nobody is claiming that white people have good/great lives. Economic, social, mental etc. struggles are universal regardless of skin colour, and people who argue about the existence of white privilege aren't denying that.
What they're describing is more of a ""POC tax"" where POC will have more struggles to face due to race. It's less the case of white people living privileged lives, and more of POC being underprivileged, if you will.
Personally, I also don't think the term white privilege captures the essence of the issue; it shouldn't be considered a privilege to not be mistreated over race. In a perfect world, all people would be treated at least as fairly as white people are today, if not more so. Not to mention the needless debate it causes when people point out that most white people also don't live lives which would be considered privileged.
But that's just my two cents 🤷🏻‍♀️","#UCLove70858

Some thoughts on why a lot of the talk about white ""privilege"" is problematic...
To me, it is horrific to call a ""privilege"" such basic things as human rights, being treated decently by the state and its law enforcement. This is not and should not be treated as a privilege - this is the bare minimum.
And what is even more problematic is the kind of rhetoric of trying to enforce guilt on people for... having basic human rights, much like you would shame a rich 16-year-old child showing off the super expensive car his father got him. It is repugnant that the one situation of privilege-induced shame should be comparable to the other.
What instead we should talk about is about how minority communities and especially black communities are disadvantaged and are being denied these basic rights. Now, I am already reading the comments where people would tell me this is not what white privilege means etc and that white people are ""comparably privileged"".
However, language is a powerful tool and language has meaning within it and leaves strong impressions often subliminal ones. When we want to make a big debate and movement the words we use matter and should be chosen carefully, as the movement and the principles that it advocates are compromised by this rhetoric- not only because it alienates certain parts of the population from wanting to listen but because it is simply wrong and harmful to connotate ""not being beaten up by the police"" with ""privilege"".
When you talk about ""privilege"" it implies something additional, a ""rare advantage"". However, the things people are talking about should be the basic position.
Shaming people for being so ""lucky"" and ""privileged"" because they have basic rights and are treated with basic human dignity and not discriminated against undermines these values that you are trying to promote. Please start talking about a much needed ""restoration of minorities basic rights"".
Being treated humanely and to not be discriminated against should never be treated as a ""privilege""","#UCLove70854

It makes you think how many other companies or organisations have been silencing the voices of bame people about their experiences until now when everyone is talking about BLM. I hope the moderators won’t go back to silencing the voices of minorities after the hubbub quietens.

I have just finished my first year and I would say I have enjoyed term one. I must say I met some really nice and fun friends at UCL, but because of the prolongued strike and the coronavirus outbreak I just feel as if I didn't spend enough time with them. We were 'close' and still are, but after so much time apart we missed opportunities to talk about next year, how to organize ourseves and most importantly... HOUSING. I am tempted to go back to London as I love the city and I enjoyed my friends laughs and going out etc. But part of the reason why I feel insecure about it is that I don't feel like asking any of my friends to move in together. First, I don't know if we are actually compatible as flatmates.. and I am scared that they might have already arranged housing with someone else. I know we are the only year in generations that has been affected this way.. but I am sure there must be other people feeling like this going into second year. I can't be the only one who feels like they missed on so much this year for strike & coronavirus... So here's a call to anyone who finds themselves in this situation. Feel free to like the post and we could maybe get in touch, hoping many of us will find other known friends, maybe coursemates, who are looking for the precisely the same thing but they just haven't talked to each other.","#UCLove70834

can we all just commit to being civil, respectable, and academic human beings who are looking towards a rational and reasonable solution?
i love my generation. we have all grown up into a world with a shifting global order (two global wars and countless skirmishes!), the looming threat of climate change, an unparalleled age of technological growth whose impact on human behaviour and depression has not been correctly measured, as well as clearly revealed racial/class-based disparities. our moment on the planet comes at a particularly special time, and the fact that we have voices and can truly voice our opinions is great, and in fact is what defines our species.
buttttttt, another equally harsh reality that we have to face is that we do not always have all the information, and that for us to truly urge the change we want to see in the world, we must first understand it. consistently on this forum and others like instagram, i've seen people becoming indignant when others don't agree with them, as well as positively unrepentant about their sweeping suggestions for reform or the maintenance of the status quo.
can we all take a second to look back, stop, and actually do some strong research on what the ""other side"" is saying? can we take a moment to understand that issues like racial and class based discrimination have existed for hundreds of years, and that to fix them will take time and effort? and, can we agree to stop completely discrediting concepts of privilege and inequality? or at the bare minimum, can we, for one second, not immediately assume that anyone that disagrees with us is doing so out of malice? that their perspective as a fellow human being perhaps has a place? that perhaps even if what they are saying is not ""right"" in our eyes, that we can still attempt to hear them and understand why they think this way?
i know this all sounds like sappy bullcrap, but we are all here a very brief time. if we spend our time outraged at each other, and blocking out communications without taking the time to empathise, we will completely waste our experience. as scholars, we must confront our biases, question our realities, and ultimately work hard to construct the next generation. it is a complete fallacy to think we can achieve this last step with only a quarter or half of us - we need everyone, from different places, ethnicities, races, and creeds - on board.

i love my generation. we have all grown up into a world with a shifting global order (two global wars and countless skirmishes!), the looming threat of climate change, an unparalleled age of technological growth whose impact on human behaviour and depression has not been correctly measured, as well as clearly revealed racial/class-based disparities. our moment on the planet comes at a particularly special time, and the fact that we have voices and can truly voice our opinions is great, and in fact is what defines our species.
buttttttt, another equally harsh reality that we have to face is that we do not always have all the information, and that for us to truly urge the change we want to see in the world, we must first understand it. consistently on this forum and others like instagram, i've seen people becoming indignant when others don't agree with them, as well as positively unrepentant about their sweeping suggestions for reform or the maintenance of the status quo.
can we all take a second to look back, stop, and actually do some strong research on what the ""other side"" is saying? can we take a moment to understand that issues like racial and class based discrimination have existed for hundreds of years, and that to fix them will take time and effort? and, can we agree to stop completely discrediting concepts of privilege and inequality? or at the bare minimum, can we, for one second, not immediately assume that anyone that disagrees with us is doing so out of malice? that their perspective as a fellow human being perhaps has a place? that perhaps even if what they are saying is not ""right"" in our eyes, that we can still attempt to hear them and understand why they think this way?
i know this all sounds like sappy bullcrap, but we are all here a very brief time. if we spend our time outraged at each other, and blocking out communications without taking the time to empathise, we will completely waste our experience. as scholars, we must confront our biases, question our realities, and ultimately work hard to construct the next generation. it is a complete fallacy to think we can achieve this last step with only a quarter or half of us - we need everyone, from different places, ethnicities, races, and creeds - on board.

I have no idea why white privilege is being debated by people who attend UCL. You are seriously ignorant if you don’t see that being white gives you an automatic advantage IN MOST CASES. Some of you people love to bring up situations like white people becoming unemployed during the pandemic, white people being poor in South Africa, etc. You should understand that no one has ever said that white people don’t go through shit or that they are not killed by the police or whatever. What people are saying is that relative to black people (and also other POCs), white people will suffer the effects of this less. You think that black people haven’t lost jobs during the pandemic? You think that there aren’t poor black people in South Africa? And while discussing South Africa maybe you want to like, idk, read about the Apartheid??????
If white people feel sad about being “vilified” or “segregated” for less than a month. Try feeling like that for your entire life.
Everyone is just starting to properly speak up against racism now. When was the last time you all saw a movement like this for racism? If you white people can’t stand not being in the spotlight for this you need to check your white privilege.
UCL has a 48.27% white student population. There is no reason for you to not have a friend or classmate that is a minority. Stop looking at statistics, you can’t be 100% sure that they haven’t been altered. Stop reading what white people write about racism. It’s like asking a Vegan if they like chicken or pork more.
Why don’t you try and have a conversation with them and actually learn more about what it’s like to not be white, the fears and worries we have, and the advantages you have over us by default. Why don’t you use the internet to learn more about this? Why don’t you just recognise that BLM movement is a good start to a global and serious problem that’s been around for way too long?","#UCLove70823

What’s equally or perhaps even more important is making steps to further change, whether it be signing petitions, sending letters to your local politicians or educating yourself and trying to better yourself.

That little addendum the admins added to that (actually quite reasonable) post about ""white privilege"" was unnecessary to be honest.
I would add a couple of points.
If you define privilege along a racial axis, you are required to define privilege along an infinite number of other axes, not limited to race, gender, sexual orientation and class, but also more obscure things like height and perceived physical attractiveness. Hence arises the notion of intersectionality. The more variables you add, the smaller the impact of the racial axis on an individual's privilege. Only when all other scales of privilege are exactly equal between two people does the idea of ""white privilege"" have the potential to become at all useful on an individual level. If it is not useful on an individual level, what can the idea be said to achieve? After all, as we are constantly reminded, change begins with individuals. There is a reason why people often find this concept unintuitive and inaccessible, and they should not be thought of as uneducated for feeling this way.
In addition, the data is not clear-cut. On the one hand, you have employers generally being more likely to invite a candidate for interview if they have a white name, all other things being equal. Then you have household earnings, where white British families trail Indian, Chinese and mixed ethnicity families. ""Other white"" ethnic groups also trail ""other Asian"" groups by the same measure. White British children are also the least likely group to attend higher education. Your average white British working-class teenager who is severely held back by his socioeconomic status is probably not thinking ""well, at least I'm not held back by my skin colour"". How are you going to get him to join your cause?
Then there are the sources that the admins added to their post. It is now common knowledge that BAME people suffer disproportionate consequences from coronavirus. I looked through the sources you added to illustrate this point, and the majority of the content was explanations about confounding factors that may contribute to this, for example socioeconomic status, roles within the healthcare system, and housing situation. Active discrimination on the part of hospitals seems to be accounted for principally by anecdotes. Of course, this is a type of evidence, but I wouldn't say it is strong enough to draw any conclusions from at the current time. More research is needed to identify gaps that aren't accounted for by confounding factors.
You link a source claiming that black Americans are killed by police at a rate disproportionate to their population. This is true, however this is the wrong denominator. It makes more sense to look at the likelihood of being killed by police when controlling for the number of police interactions. Turns out, when this is done, the data is again less clear https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/reconciling-results-racial-differences-police-shootings. Of course, this doesn't rule out the fact that black people are disproportionately ""policed"", but it goes against the killing narrative. Similarly in the UK, black people who are arrested are no more likely to die in custody than white people who are arrested https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52890363
I await this post receiving a lot of angry/laugh reacts but I thought I'd try and introduce a bit of balance to what is largely a group of people making their first foray into identity politics.
A lot of the time when people urge others to ""educate themselves"" on these issues, what they are really asking is for them to educate themselves on the viewpoints of a specific author, group of authors, or a specific sociological school of thought. I'd be interested to know if the same people have ever read anything arguing against the concept, or at least the usefulness, of ""white privilege"". The same arguments surrounding the term have been in the mainstream for at least the last 5 years, yet have made relatively little progress in terms of getting people on-board outside academic circles and Twitter.

Noooo that is too far. There isn’t anything wrong with a PhD student dating an undergrad from a completely different discipline. The PhD student isn’t that senior in the uni and there is no chance they will come into contact with the undergrad in a teaching capacity.
As for the OP, it is not “creepy” to have a relationship with a 5/6 year age gap. People do have different maturity levels, and whilst some relationships may be unbalanced, not all of them are. It’s patronising to lump everyone together as being exploited when they’re all adults and can date whatever age they want.","#UCLove70802

Hey East Asians,
In the UK, does it feel like we aren’t so common that generalisations and racism against us are publicly condemned, like Blacks and South Asians? And we aren’t so rare like South Americans, Southeast Asians and Polynesians that people don’t have enough knowledge of them to have widespread ways of mocking us.
More than once restaurant workers, shop staff have said “ni hao” as the first words they say when they meet me and my other East Asian friends, without asking where we’re from. Is this really the quality of service in the UK the world should be expecting? Is this what the world expects of British culture?
Please help out by going full Karen to report racism from staff to store managers.","#UCLove70800

Saw an admin comment on a post earlier today and it made me do a double take and question things. I remember back in the day where UCLove was filled with varying opinions and the admins didn’t put their personal opinions on things... they moderated things impartially as any good admin should and filtered out any horrific posts which shouldn’t be seen.
In this case I agreed mostly (not fully however) with the post and I don’t feel that admins should post their “counter” to the argument just because they don’t agree. Do this in the comments surely 🤷🏽‍♀️ They never used to comment on posts (even not on some of the hideous posts I’ve seen in my years at UCL - IMO there’s some sexual related stuff that really should’ve been removed or had an added disclaimer)? Why now? Why shit on this persons opinion and why not let the reader decide their stance rather than forcing them to think in the way YOU want them to?
It’s starting to feel like freedom of speech is a load of shit everywhere and we’re expected to follow the same views as everyone else or we’re branded with names because we have varying opinions or nuanced beliefs. Out of anywhere I’ve felt UCL was open to lots of different opinions which made it such a great place, but maybe that’s starting to turn also.","#UCLove70799

I would just like to point out that the ""white privilege"" rhetoric I've seen splattered across social media platforms is so counterproductive . Think of the millions of white people living in extreme poverty across the west, those who have lost their job due to Covid-19, the homeless, the disabled, the terminally ill, those living in highly dysfunctional families, whose life is a complete mess and an utter tragedy, how do you think they feel when a wealthy kid with a phd from their top university bubble insist they should feel guilty about being born with white skin and how much more advantaged they are than non-white people? Being white has a variety of advantages, fact, but it's not as determinant to leading a good life as much as social class. Being born white doesn't automatically place you in a good social class, likewise being born non-white doesn't automatically place you in a bad social class. The simplistic view according to which all white people are so privileged and anyone else is oppressed is terribly divisive. The phrase I've seen repeated everywhere to counteract this argument is this one: ""I'm not saying white people don't have problems or that their problems are not important, i'm saying that the colour of their skin is not one of these problems,"" which is the same as saying ""white people have problems, even very serious ones, but none of these problems is as bad as being non-white"" which is simply not true. This statement creates the paradox that white people's problems are less important than non-white people's problems - therefore effectively turning white skin into a problem itself, in fact if it wasn't problematic being white why would you make such a big deal out of it? Being white is clearly a problem to you. Making a problem out of white skin won't help solve problems of people with non-white skin, actually it may end up making things just worse. Don't be surprised when all these unacknowledged white people you are ridiculing end up voting for Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Bolsonaro, Salvini etc. What about we start actually collaborating and empathizing with each other, focusing on the interests and goals we ALL have in common such as eradicating violence, redistributing wealth, improving education and healthcare, demilitarizing the police (PS resentment towards white people is not a very good mutual interest) WITHOUT turning everything into a racial football match? I'm confident many whites and non-whites would agree. Peace x
Admin: oh the strawman in this argument. The statement you quoted (""I'm not saying white people don't have problems or that their problems are not important, i'm saying that the colour of their skin is not one of these problems,"") has nothing to do with your 'explanation' ('which is the same as saying ""white people have problems, even very serious ones, but none of these problems is as bad as being non-white""). Imagine having to deal with the virus and poverty and homelessness while knowing that ON TOP of all the other things you mention the British BAME Covid-19 death rate is ‘more than twice that of whites’ (https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200420-coronavirus-why-some-racial-groups-are-more-vulnerable)
Or that ON TOP of everything black Americans are 2.5X more likely than whites to be killed by police (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.statista.com/chart/amp/21872/map-of-police-violence-against-black-americans/)

I would just like to point out that the ""white privilege"" rhetoric I've seen splattered across social media platforms is so counterproductive . Think of the millions of white people living in extreme poverty across the west, those who have lost their job due to Covid-19, the homeless, the disabled, the terminally ill, those living in highly dysfunctional families, whose life is a complete mess and an utter tragedy, how do you think they feel when a wealthy kid with a phd from their top university bubble insist they should feel guilty about being born with white skin and how much more advantaged they are than non-white people? Being white has a variety of advantages, fact, but it's not as determinant to leading a good life as much as social class. Being born white doesn't automatically place you in a good social class, likewise being born non-white doesn't automatically place you in a bad social class. The simplistic view according to which all white people are so privileged and anyone else is oppressed is terribly divisive. The phrase I've seen repeated everywhere to counteract this argument is this one: ""I'm not saying white people don't have problems or that their problems are not important, i'm saying that the colour of their skin is not one of these problems,"" which is the same as saying ""white people have problems, even very serious ones, but none of these problems is as bad as being non-white"" which is simply not true. This statement creates the paradox that white people's problems are less important than non-white people's problems - therefore effectively turning white skin into a problem itself, in fact if it wasn't problematic being white why would you make such a big deal out of it? Being white is clearly a problem to you. Making a problem out of white skin won't help solve problems of people with non-white skin, actually it may end up making things just worse. Don't be surprised when all these unacknowledged white people you are ridiculing end up voting for Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Bolsonaro, Salvini etc. What about we start actually collaborating and empathizing with each other, focusing on the interests and goals we ALL have in common such as eradicating violence, redistributing wealth, improving education and healthcare, demilitarizing the police (PS resentment towards white people is not a very good mutual interest) WITHOUT turning everything into a racial football match? I'm confident many whites and non-whites would agree. Peace x
Admin: oh the strawman in this argument. The statement you quoted (""I'm not saying white people don't have problems or that their problems are not important, i'm saying that the colour of their skin is not one of these problems,"") has nothing to do with your 'explanation' ('which is the same as saying ""white people have problems, even very serious ones, but none of these problems is as bad as being non-white""). Imagine having to deal with the virus and poverty and homelessness while knowing that ON TOP of all the other things you mention the British BAME Covid-19 death rate is ‘more than twice that of whites’ (https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200420-coronavirus-why-some-racial-groups-are-more-vulnerable)
Or that ON TOP of everything black Americans are 2.5X more likely than whites to be killed by police (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.statista.com/chart/amp/21872/map-of-police-violence-against-black-americans/)

While the Not Cool Club has done some impressive work over the last year in raising awareness about sexual harassment on campus, its mission to promote diversity and BAME inclusion will be hindered by its refusal to acknowledge how the club itself hijacked a movement that was put into motion by black women.
The club's website cites the #MeToo movement as its inspiration, but nowhere does it credit Tarana Burke and the other incredible black women who laboured and persevered to ensure that the voices of black victims of sexual violence were heard. The Not Cool Club took this movement and framed it through its own lens which, consciously or not, is white centric. It white washes the efforts of the black women behind #MeToo and is problematic in this way, particularly as its committee lacks so much diversity and is not representative of the multiethnic make-up of our campus.
Yes, it is now making steps to become more diverse - but acknowledge your own problematic beginnings whilst doing so as well. Challenge your own manifest white-centricity. Give credit to black creators and black women where it is due. For further info on this, read these following articles:
qz.com: 'MeToo hijacked black women’s work on race and gender equality'
medium.com: 'The White Washing of #MeToo'
By the way, I tried to publish a UCLove saying the same exact things a few months ago but it was never approved. I hope the revival of BLM has allowed admins to review their own biases and will allow this post to go through as it should have last time. Our voices and criticisms should NOT be silenced, not least by a confessions page of an ethnically diverse university.","#UCLove70777

I feel guilty for being sad and depressed when I know other people are having a worse time than me but I feel like I’ve lost so much.

Thank you for OP for highlighting this issue! While most people will view this issue under the lecturer-student relationship, I will just like to draw your attention to relationships between PhD students and undergrads. If I’m not wrong (PhD students please correct me on this) PhD students are informed during their orientation week that they’re severely discouraged from forming romantic relationships with students, as it will impair the teaching and the potential bias involved. This is an aspect that isn’t highlighted enough but is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue in universities worldwide. While the age gap at first doesn’t seem too large (5-6 years), it’s the power imbalance that exist within this relationship that is fundamentally problematic.
Whether this PhD student is teaching the undergrad or not, it’s still fundamentally not right, as they are technically a paid member of staff. It’s basically a teacher-student relationship. It makes it even more exploitative if there is a relationship then, as the PhD student is aware of the consequences of such actions and have been forewarned against such relationships. And I cannot stress enough that this can happen to anyone, regardless of your gender and sexual orientation. I hope with UCL putting out a public statement on its stance on the matter, more open discussions can be made regarding this issue in UCL in the future, to increase awareness of the vulnerability of young people and to increase support for those who unfortunately have been victims of this exploitation.
I believe that most, if not almost all PhD students are not like this, and never intent to take such actions, but to the select few who still believes it’s okay because your undergrad of choice is “mature” or “legal”, here are a few choice words for you.
You’re a creep and an exploitative adult.","#UCLove70757

Whether this PhD student is teaching the undergrad or not, it’s still fundamentally not right, as they are technically a paid member of staff. It’s basically a teacher-student relationship. It makes it even more exploitative if there is a relationship then, as the PhD student is aware of the consequences of such actions and have been forewarned against such relationships. And I cannot stress enough that this can happen to anyone, regardless of your gender and sexual orientation. I hope with UCL putting out a public statement on its stance on the matter, more open discussions can be made regarding this issue in UCL in the future, to increase awareness of the vulnerability of young people and to increase support for those who unfortunately have been victims of this exploitation.
I believe that most, if not almost all PhD students are not like this, and never intent to take such actions, but to the select few who still believes it’s okay because your undergrad of choice is “mature” or “legal”, here are a few choice words for you.
You’re a creep and an exploitative adult.",,1591848658,,,0,3,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2789978614447018&id=1310505995727628,

To the honourable gentleman, who said UCL is ruining it's reputation, because of hosting courses such as Professional Policing.
I am a Security and Crime Science Student at UCL. UCL was the very first university, to start teaching theoretical and practical Master and then Bachelor level courses in these areas, which, by the way, also include policing. Whilst my point of view might therefore be biased, at least I have an idea what I am talking about, without judging a book by its cover.
Since UCL 's Security and Crime Science Department can be considered a major success story, as it is one of a kind in the world, and more importantly, nearly 100% of students are immediately employed, other unis such as Lancester or King's started to develp similar programs, recognising the financial gap and the demand for more educated professionals in the industry.
Yes, there are things that one could just consider bullshit. However, there is an insanely large and ever growing literature, trying to learn the most about real life incidents. The aim of all these programms is to encourage evidence based and problem oriented policing, especially to prevent abuses of power, which we know have seen a lot especially in the US. UCL Explore has more than enough papers, for anyone interested, to look at the literature. Further, whilst most people will get stuck in a couple of disciplines, researchers in these areas utilize an extremely wide range of disciplines, including psychology, criminology, behavioural genetics, neuroscience, systems and engineering studies, stats and modelling, basic chemistry and physics and so on...
So therefore, for example chemists are absolutely right claiming that we will never know chemistry like they do, but the point is, we don't need to. We just need to understand the basics (of e.g. nerv agents), to guide any decisions later on based on actual scientific evidence, instead of hunches or feelings. So basically, our job is to support all of you from nr. 1 education to engineering, or even management. Gathering and synthetizing the evidence across the disciplines, and then guiding informed decision making.
So if you have no idea what this stuff is, educate yourself. Might come handy in these days with the american crisis. And if you were to critique papers on quality or methodology please do so, that's how scientific progress works. Or at least, this is what they told me here...","#UCLove70752

Can someone please (non-berating and non-aggressively, if you can’t do this, you’re embarrassing your ability to express yourself) the issue people have with students ultimately working for their parents companies?
There are a few people like this in my course and I have noticed that there is a lot of jealousy geared towards them. In UCL in general too.
Although I don’t come from this background, one of my best friends does. Her parents were born in poverty and worked their arses off to build a successful company. It was their personal dream to firstly, build a name and legacy for themselves, and secondly, allow their children to continue this legacy. They’re humble but very proud of their accomplishments and I’m genuinely happy for them too, because I see how much work they put in and the sacrifices they make.
So why does it bother people if she chooses to work for them? She’s at university studying to equip herself with the skills to make her own contribution. She works hard and wants to make her parents proud too. I understand that it’s definitely easier than having to look for a job, but why is her effort discredited?
I’m genuinely confused because I feel like nobody else shares my opinion so I’m trying to find the hole in it. Yes, it’s a privilege, but there are hundreds of privileges, and life was never said to be fair. Nobody is entitled to what someone else has (except for taxpayer money which should be funding social development and not militarising the police, #BLM).
She may be lucky, but do you expect people like her to refuse to accept that job just because every single other person doesn’t have this opportunity? If this is the case then none of us should eat a meal because not everyone has one. Are we to forget that her parents are people, who are equally important and entitled to their dreams, who set a goal and this is the fruit of it? (This is not to say people who didn’t achieve such financial success did not work hard).
For what it’s worth, her parents are great people who started a lot of community youth clubs and offer great, well-paid internships - I know because I did one of them. But whilst this is nice, I don’t think it should matter to be honest. I’m not from a wealthy background and I don’t feel any jealousy towards her at all.
Again, please no stupid “eat the rich” or whatever comments. Only being able to express your opinion through insults is incredibly immature.","#UCLove70747

You aren’t “mature” for your age, they’re a creep.
It’s alluring, for someone 5-6 years older than you to pay you special attention, to say you’re mature for your age. It might even be your first serious relationship. After all, it’s exhilarating that this adult will want to even hang out with you. They’re so cool and have so many exciting things to show and talk to you about. You might even shared a multitude of common interests together.
Only it’s not. Think about it, why would an adult nearing their mid-20s or even older, be interested in a teenager. When you’re at that age, you’re so vulnerable. You’re in a new school, possibly new country, barely 18 and still figuring who you are. Think of it from your perspective, will you want to hang out with someone 5-6 years younger than you? The word “mature” unfortunately scares me now. It’s the words these groomers and adults use to evoke a sense of exclusivity and recognition that I craved at that age.
That’s exploitation. There’s a power imbalance that will always exist within those relationship.
Whether you’re male or female or go by non-binary terms, it can happen to anyone. Grooming can happen to anyone at any age, and regardless of gender or sexual orientation. And it thrives in silence and the exploitation of trust. It’s difficult to identify it, your feelings and emotions say otherwise, but take a moment to think through the situation. You may not even be aware. This didactic relationship exposes you so much risks. If you need to keep your relationship discreet, think about why do you even need to keep it discreet in the first place.
There’s a reason why UCL has banned it.

The following is a true story
Ok so basically not long ago some guys from my hall went to ministry and I decided to take the mature decision and not go as I had a 9am lecture the next day. So I got an early night and slept at about 11pm. At roughly 12-1AM, I get woken up by someone I know who went to ministry. He was extremely drunk and 2 other people were helping him walk back to halls. I saw through the window that he wasn’t looking great so I decided to quickly change and help him to get back into his room. He was making loud noises on the way so I put my hand on his mouth to prevent other residents of the hall being woken up. I helped him and I actually saved him from falling down the stairs and hitting his head on the floor on several separate occasions. If it wasn’t for me, that guy would have been seriously injured and potentially be in hospital or even dead. I knew I did the right thing and he should be thankful for what I did. None of the other guys helped him in any way shape or form.
He still seemed pretty drunk when he got to his room. So we went to bed and I woke up the next day fine. I wanted to make sure he was ok, so I messaged him to ask him if he was alright as I didn’t see him the whole day. I go to my lectures and let time pass. I open my phone again and this fucktard has the audacity to leave me on read not realising that I potentially saved his life. I think he was at least over the drink limit and he should be lucky that I didn’t report him to the police or even his parents. He should at least have the maturity and intellectual capacity to say something like “yeah I’m fine, thanks for asking” or “thank you for taking me to my room”. See this is the sort of idiots you’ll come across in university, I don’t even know how tf he got into UCL. I knew he was fully sober so there was no way he was reading his messages while drunk.
I know this happened a while ago but things like this you don’t forget. He was just being a dick and didn’t want to admit it. He should at least have the decency to apologise for his poor behaviour and he didn’t even do that. Even if he messaged me saying sorry or apologises in the comments today, that’ll be fine and I can put this whole thing behind me.
Just be glad you haven’t come across these sort of people. You can just tell that’s he’s the sort of person who will drop out of university and end up doing drugs and living on the street. I can just imagine what would happen if his parents found out.
What are your thoughts on this?","#UCLove70740

WANT TO BE A POTENTIAL LIFESAVER LOCKDOWN?
UCL Marrow are the student branch of the national charity Anthony Nolan, who saves the lives of people with blood cancer. Their aim is to sign up students to the stem cell register.
Right now, white Europeans have a 69% chance of finding the best possible match, whilst people from black, asian and ethnic minority backgrounds have only 20.5% chance. Diversifying the register can help to address this imbalance and work to ensure that nobody dies waiting for lifesaving stem cells, regardless of their ethnicity.
If you're interested, please sign up - it is so easy and quick, and you could go on to save a life by doing something so simple!

Given all the protests about colonial figures statues and memorials currently, I'm reminded of the the fact that the memorial stone outside the student centre to the Choshu Five, one of whom is Ito Hirobumi, is still standing. A previous poster said this around a year ago, but nothing seems to have been done about it.
A number of Japanese students, among the first to study in Europe, studied at UCL since most other British universities at the time required students to be Christians. One of them, Ito Hirobumi was Japan's first prime minister. His western education made him a key figure in the Meiji Restoration, which led to Japan becoming an industrial and modern power. However, he was also the first Resident-General in colonial Korea. His tenure ultimately ended after his assassination at the hands of a Korean nationalist, who viewed him as a symbol of the annexation and colonisation of Korea by the Japanese.
Hirobumi clearly has a complex legacy, particularly since it seems he initially opposed the wholesale annexation of Korea. However, as the first colonial ruler of Korea, which endured many decades of colonial occupation during which Koreans were made to feel inferior in their own country, he is definitely a reviled figure in East Asia. I am not sure if the memorial should be removed, given that the Choshu Five were such an important part of Japan's history. However, the fact that UCL so uncritically displays this memorial, without explaining the imperialistic legacy of the students is somewhat inconsistent. On the UCL website, Hirobumi is simply listed as the first prime minister of Japan. This would kind of be like having Rhodes listed as an alumni simply noting he was a minister of the Cape Colony, without mentioning that he was involved in British Imperialism.

I commented and responded to their hate on the post of the girl I actually am ‘friends with on Facebook’ but I just feel so overwhelmingly like nothing can be done. Ultimately, I do not believe that you can change peoples opinions (especially when they are in fact read up on the topic).

If I multiply my hourly rate of teaching [ £9000/(lectures + seminar) ] by the those that I missed the total is at least double the amount they're offering and am dissatisfied. Apologies for bringing the ever-dominant dollar to the fore but this is about articulating the expectation and rights of the students as customer - as is the present case.
P.S. can anybody see a flaw in this grand plan? at first I worried the £££ would come out of the teachers' salaries but that conclusion would lead to further strikes and be too illogical for even UCL management.","#UCLove70666

Are any other first years terrified of the feeling that uni is already just slipping by?
Our first year lasted a whole of six months and we're incredibly lucky to even have had that experience but at least to me, it felt a bit too good to be true, and now I see why I had that feeling. Just all seems really shit that we have two and a half years of having fun at university and being in this non-judgemental atmosphere where we will get along with more people than anywhere else in life, and then it's on to working life and getting emotionally drained by hostile competitive colleagues until we retire. Really don't know how I would ever manage to be this happy again after uni ends and people grow up and f off to live their own lives
Hopeful comments appreciated under this, sorry for the sad post","#UCLove70560

Calling to all BBC’s!! (.. I mean British Born Chinese👲🏼🍆)
If you self-identify in having a tiger parent🐯 (if you know, you know) – as part of my primary fieldwork for my dissertation, I would love to interview you and hear more about your experiences on how this impacted your attitudes to education! The focus question being ‘What is the role of tiger parenting in the construction of British Chinese students’ learner identities?’
As many of you may agree, the British Chinese community as a whole are often underrepresented in both society and in academia, therefore I would love to take this opportunity to shed light to British Chinese students and their perspective on how ‘tiger’ parents, Chinese culture and their upbringing plays a role in shaping their learner identity (this may include your achievements/ expectations; aspirations; wellbeing) and values towards education!
Too often, our ‘British’ identity of being ‘British Chinese’ is neglected, hence my research aims to project the voices of those who find themselves somewhere between the two cultures. On one hand, being raised in a strict Chinese household which strongly emphasises Confucian principles of filial piety and the high value of education. Whereas on the other hand being raised in a British context where society prioritises children’s individuality and wellbeing, where ‘trying your best’ is good enough. It is understandable how this can be conflicting at times!
If you can relate and would like to share your experiences – please comment below and I’ll drop you a message for more information (serious candidates only pls!)
Amidst the current situation with Covid-19, I hope you and your families are all keeping well and healthy♥","#UCLove70469

I deleted temporary files from windows 10 settings and apparently something important got deleted so my surface book 2 booted and the bitlocker recovery blue screen appeared.
Yes I'm stupid 😁: I don't have any backup, I don't have the recovery key, and of course I have deadlines for the next week and all my files are on the local drive (yay). I know the straight - forward solution is to reset the computer, however I REALLY need to recover my files. Any ideas or suggestions? Is there any way to recover files, or decrypt a recovery key knowing the recovery ID? No ironic comments please, my life is already awful enough: holding on like a leaf to its tree in the storm🍃😂

With all that’s going on and the amount of praise the NHS is getting, I wanted to give praise to a group of people who have barely been mentioned in the news or on social media, nor have been given any discounts on anything.
Shop workers in Asda, Tesco, Lidl, Sainsbury’s etc are all working extra hours, putting their lives at risk, and making sure this nation is well stocked up on not only the essentials but luxuries as well.
As someone who has worked in a shop stacking shelves to fund my degree, I know how hard it is to do the same job day in day out, for very little money, and very little recognition - in fact most people look at you at like they are above you. if they decided to go on strike, quit and stay at home, this country would fall apart far quicker than if the NHS disbanded.
Show your respect to these people, even a simple thank you when someone serves you at the shop goes a long way.
This is not a dig at the NHS because I am Of course undeniably grateful for the hard work staff are doing, but at least they have access to PPE and can wear it all the time, have the moral of the population, knowledge they get rewards and discounts on services outside the NHS, and fundamentally a wage considerably higher than shop workers.
Work is work no matter if you’re a doctor or a cleaner at Asda. No one is greater than anyone else and ANYONE serving this country during this crisis deserves praises irrespective of their background.

Hi UCL Students, we are Students for Rent Strike.
With the spread of COVID-19 we all have limited access to teaching, our libraries and even our accommodation.We don't think it's fair that we continue to subsidise Universities running only half its operations with rent money for accommodation we have been advised to leave, when we could be helping our families and saving for the hard times ahead.
Join us in our demand that summer term rent for university provided accommodation forgiven or refunded to students, across the UK. If we stand together and refuse to pay our voices will be heard, join a growing list of students at universities across the country and join our demand that we be treated fairly in this time of crisis.

UCL students, please can you show a bit more respect and kindness towards people with ASD.
I'm so tired of getting funny looks, being ignored or talked about behind my back. I know I come across as a bit abnormal, and sometimes I talk a lot in lessons and I'm not always aware that other people are bored or would like to talk also. It's not personal or rudeness, it's just my brain.
Most days I come home feeling absolutely shit, trying not to cry because I've offended someone again or made them feel uncomfortable. I go over conversations again and again in my head trying to figure out where I missed up and what I said that has made that person withdraw socially from me. There's no cure, fuck me I wish there were, so please just be nicer and make my life a bit easier.","#UCLove70313

What's going on with this picture nomination post a photo of yourself thing? It started off as a men's mental health thing because 75% of suicides are men and it's the leading cause of death in young men. But now girls are just nominating each other to do it and I don't get the point. Of course mental health is important in everyone regardless of gender, but now you're just defeating the purpose of this. The main message has been lost and everyone's just doing it for fun. Anyway y'all stay safe whatever your gender.","#UCLove70203

UCL’s response to PhDs loosing lab time because of UCL being physically totally shut down is as great as ever!! Have a choice between (a) carrying on without access to lab as best as possible remotely, still get paid but have no guarantees of getting funding extension for lost lab time, or (b) interrupt your PhD officially and don’t get paid for that duration but then your PhD time isn’t run down.
They’ve basically made it my own fault that I have to continue to be paid!! So if this situation continues either on and off over a year or for an extended period it is my own fault for needing to be paid and carrying on when I cannot access my laboratory as access have been revoked at this time!

""hissy fit by postdocs/PGTAs""
Let's talk about that. PGTAs are often PhD students. PhD students in the UK get on average £15k for 12 months. They have no choice but to be PGTAs in the department, sometimes even often forced. They work on zero hour contracts. If the labs get cancelled, they aren't paid. They are not trained either. PGTAs have tried for many years to get better contracts, UCL simply won't listen.
We had to take this action, focus on your blame on UCL and demand for a refund on your lost education. Don't blame other students who are in similar/worse positions than you are.","#UCLove70073

Dear first-year econ students, (and geography students too!)
It's been a bloody awful year for you with all the strikes and now Corona virus as a cherry on top of the worst pie in existence.
I don't know what will happen with your exams (fingers crossed they're cancelled!) but in case they're not I thought I'd share my notes from last year to help you out.
This link will take you to a google drive folder with notes for ECON0002, ECON0007 (World economy) and for any first year Geography students/anyone taking this as an optional GEOG0007 (Human Ecology). It also includes a document with links to quizlet quizzes for ECON0002, ECON0010, ECON0005, ECON0007 and GEOG0007.
LINK: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P0jRUdEAK4JzIrwQAJrIbT4fMW5c1h1W
These all served me well last year and I hope you will find them helpful.
Love,
A second year Econ student","#UCLove70049

A Request for UCL to change their current stance on assessments
https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/a-request-for-ucl-to-change-their-current-stance
People may have different opinions on this, but I think the stance UCL is taking on exams so far isn’t appropriate for the situation. I know its a new challenge for them, but it seems at the moment that exams will go on in a way as similar to normal as possible. We’ve been told we won't be disadvantaged, but also not advantaged. Considering we’ve already missed so much teaching this year. Then for the last bit of teaching, and all of revision, we have a pandemic. Asking us to carry on working as normal seems like madness. If the university isn't going to provide better measures for us assessment wise, the situation is most definitely going to disadvantage us. If it may not disadvantage you in particular, please think about all the other people that it might. The current stance UCL has, to me seems to neglect both fairness, and their students' mental and physical health as priorities. Most likely, the situation is going to get much worse and i really think instead of having to prioritise work, we should be given space to look after ourselves and older people in our communities. I’m putting this out here to see if other people agree that we should have more appropriate and flexible style assessments that give us this additional space. I think it's important to say something before decisions get emailed out.
The issues at hand are described in more detail below
1. A high volume of students are dealing with family strife - unable to return home or being forced to. Travel is dangerous. The displacement caused by sudden uprooting is mentally and physically draining.
2. The pandemic is having a drastic effect on the economy. Families may come under financial hardship and students may be unable to pay their rent or afford their shopping.
3. Many students that have gone home are in different time zones and may not be able to attend online classes or sit exams
4. Not everyone has access to reliable internet, computers or suitable work environments at home.
5. It may turn out that many people are personally affected by loved ones catching the virus, some of these likely to be quite serious cases. It is immoral to expect students to revise in such a scenario
6. Due to strikes, we will have missed many weeks of taught classes, 2 of which will be online. We are missing over half of an entire semester.
7. Across campus, many buildings are likely to be close due to the virus.
8. As material in university can be incredibly challenging, tutorials, seminars and in-person contact hours are VITAL to understanding our material.
9. Further, personal engagement is essential to most people with learning difficulties.
10. With less taught material, we are unable to write engaged and informed essays. In some cases, there is barely any material eligible for examination.
11. Many of our assessments will not be marked before our exams and final essay deadlines. This feedback is critical to good performance in final assessments.
12. Even if the Library remains open, it is a dangerous place to be for immunocompromised people. It is also difficult to be on campus or in the library with the anxiety caused by the virus. Health officials advise all people to engage in social distancing and self-isolation if sick. Going to the library is outside of that recommendation.
13. Debilitating anxiety prevents people from doing their coursework, many people are experiencing this as their personal situations become more strenuous and uncertain.
14. Additionally, many East and Southeast Asian students have been burdened by increased racism and xenophobia in the wake of the virus.
15. Students with existing mental health issues are overburdened by the stress of the virus, lack of support and contact hours.
16. In lieu of full cancellations, some students’ degrees are dependent upon examinations - including many STEM students. However, keep in mind that not everyone has a reliable internet connection or access to a home computer, they should have the option to take their mark as is.
17. Mature students and carers have additional responsibilities that impact their ability to complete their work.
Other Universities like UCLA have implemented similar policies.
We do not believe that dissertations should be cancelled, as it is a continuation of the studies we have been doing since last semester and is a meaningful part of our degrees. We do believe that amendments must be made, based on the following facts:
1. Students are cut off from their supervisors - students should receive revised and extended deadlines for dissertation submission.
2. Students whose dissertations rely on access to physical resources - labs, testing equipment, software and books - should receive further leniency, amendments and extensions.
3. Further guidelines should be provided on how to write project reports for students undergoing research projects who have only been able to acquire half as much data as they should have.
As a final plea, we urge you to consider the financial implications the strikes coupled by this virus has on your students. We ask that you consider refunding each student the equivalent amount of at least 4 weeks tuition (£3,036.37 for international students), based on the following facts:
1. Students forced to return home and repatriate are incurring even higher costs.
2. We were not taught for 5 weeks straight and endured strikes last semester and in fall of 2019 as well.
3. We did not enroll at this University to take online classes.
4. Our access to resources (academic and supportive) has been denied, either explicitly through the occupation and closed schools or implicitly through anxiety due to the virus. This is also what our tuition covers.

In this time of uncertainty and fear, I thought I'd just share a comment I found on Reddit that made me feel better about all the shit that's been going down this year. Hopefully it makes a few other people feel better too!
""In WWII bombs were getting dropped on London. People kept calm and carried on. Black death devastated Europe. Society carried on.
Right now, people are panicked. 'If I was wrong about this, what else am I wrong about?' We know the world is about to change, but we don't know what it's going to look like yet. That's scary. But in a few weeks we'll know. And then things will get less scary. People will adapt. We'll figure out a way to move through this. Humanity has always found a way to adapt and keep going. Scarier and far more destructive things have happened. We carry on. our generation has had a fairly easy time so far, so it's hard to feel this right now. But looking throughout history, the message is clear, people always go on. Society always carries on.
We're very cynical in the modern age. It's easy to think everyone is a dick bag sometimes. But the true picture of humanity is the 99.99% of drivers in traffic everyday. We all work together. We get to where we need to go. We all basically follow the rules. Everyone is invested in this thing called society. And most people are going to be doing the right things. Just watch, the first stage in any crisis is panic. The second stage is going to be people coming together in ways that will move you to your core. People will circle the wagons and take care of each other. That's what people always do.""","#UCLove69895

due to the virus, i had to return home -- which for me is a very toxic place full of bad memories. part of the reason why i chose to come to the uk for my education was to leave my home environment in the first place. for the past four days i've been crying and completely unable to do anything at all. i dont have the resources i need here. i left on a very short notice, so all my stuff is still back in halls and it looks like i'll need to pay for term three. my parents start to suffer economically. i have younger siblings that are at home buzzing with energy and thus, LOUD. i have numerous household chores because all the family's constantly home and so everything is chaos - and my parents for some reason think i have no obligations whatsoever for university, so they treat me like their maid. on top of that, a friend passed away (not from the virus). my grandma has gone completely nuts with panic so i constantly have to be there for her emotionally. im considering just dropping out and giving up because regardless of any attempts i make to establish a normal life someplace wherever, they're always sabotaged. i know this is a very selfish way to look at things, but i cant help it.","#UCLove69891

I don’t think you realise - there are a ton of valid reasons a person may not be able to self isolate. Some of us have very difficult family situations back home. Some of us cannot mentally cope with being in confined spaces. Some of us can’t afford to have internet at home or to buy a computer to work from. A friend of mine had a difficult housing situation and the only place she could regularly shower at was the student centre.
You don’t have the moral high ground just because you can have an instagram worthy #quarantine.

3rd-year medic here. Is it just me or it feels like our ibsc leads don't really care about our mental health and worries that we have in this situation?
At least the medical school has a plan on what to do with assessments for the pre-clinical years. How can we be expected to submit our assignments and dissertation on the given deadlines when this whole situation is impacting our lives and make us worry about our health, family situation and relatives across the country/world.
I understand they might have not figured out what to do exactly with our exams but could postpone a few deadlines just to give us some time to breathe and adjust to the situation. Many of us are self-isolating and this can have a massive effect mental health, personally I can't concentrate well at home and been struggling to continue my essays.","#UCLove69871

To all UCL Students:
Although the Coronavirus outbreak is getting worse and worse(with the UK suffering from nearly 2000 cases at the time of writing), please do not panic and over worry about it, as worrying about the disease too much won't help anything: in fact, this will only take a toll on your mental wellbeing. To those who're panicking, I understand your feelings: I'm a heavy panicker and I know that trying to remain calm in the face of the disease is easier said than done, but please remember that you can still try your best to protect yourself by remaining vigilant and though maintaining your hygiene and avoiding crowds despite the disease's contagious nature, and an effective community response against it can effectively delay the spread of the disease(look what's happening in Hong Kong for example! The main reason that the disease spread very slowly is that everyone knows what to do!) So, to those who're shivering in fear due to the coronavirus, don't be afraid-you can surely overcome the virus considering that you and other people know what to do. Follow government guidelines and make sure that everyone you know knows what to do, and we can all have a nice cold pint and safety wait for all of this to blow over.
To those who are underreacting to the disease though, however; please start to be alert of the disease. It's much more dangerous than you think-sure, the mortality rate is not high, but the disease is highly contagious and we can't do anything to cure patients other than keeping them alive and hope that their immune system do the job, meaning that once too many people got infected by the coronavirus, it can paralyze the medical system and cause mortality for nCOV and other patients to skyrocket(look what is happening in Italy and Iran for reference). So, please start to be vigilant and be careful before it's too late.
While preparing for the coronavirus, however, don't stockpile on stuff and only get the amount of stuff you need. I know telling you to not panic buy is very clichéd, but a major problem in London is that people panic buy to the extent that a lot of grocery store shelves are empty, and this means that not everyone(especially the ones who are more vulnerable to the disease) can get the things they need due to the selfishness of some paranoid people. So, please, only get the stuff you need so that everyone(including you) can have enough supplies.
Although the whole situation in the UK is looking grim, we can still overcome the disease by remaining safe and delaying it's spread until a cure or vaccine is invented. So please find a balance between being overreacting and underreacting, encourage and educate everyone you'll know about the disease and what we can do, and try your best to remain in your homes following the cancellation of face-to-face classes and exams. Keep calm and carry on, and we can emerge victorious at the end.

I'm sorry but UCL better give us generous deadline extensions for essays due at the start of term 3. It's not even a case of ""oh I'm missing the last two weeks of class I cba to catch up."" The entire country (and the world, in fact) is literally coming to a halt and that shit is both draining and mind boggling to even CONSIDER, let alone to experience it. Each day is becoming exponentially more serious, and this is unnerving to say the least. I hope UCL (and I'm sure they will) consider that it's not just the missed classes that warrant mitigation, but the fact that we are in a once in a lifetime situation that is A LOT to take in.
p.s. don't take this post the wrong way: I know the situation is awful and there are people out there losing loved ones, and that there are more important things to worry about all things considered, and I know there are students who are coming off of this worse than I am, however (and I'm sure final year students will vouch for this) these finals are significant enough that they can determine our future for good or for worse, and I wish neither for myself nor for my fellow students to suffer academically because of this pandemic. I feel I'm within my right to express this concern, but don't wish to come across as selfish or narrow minded :)","#UCLove69737

Tonight’s news about the virus lasting until next year really depressed me tbh. Idk and idc if it’s something political or anything else, but if they keep doing nothing/little, I’m actually going to say I’m so disappointed. I used to be very low-key proud of living here and studying here. And very thankful of being able to experience everything. Been here for 4 years and this is the first time I ever start to doubt if I have made the wrong choice.","#UCLove69629

Email template to try and get released from contracts for third term - if you live in halls please send to accommodation@ucl.ac.uk !!
Dear UCL Accommodation,
I am writing to request a release from my accommodation contract for the third term.
UCL has taken the step of suspending the unseen examination period due to Coronavirus. This means my presence in London for the third term - the sole reason that I engage with your services as a provider of accommodation - has been negated. The decision to suspend the unseen examination period has not followed from any specific advice from Public Health England, and therefore I could not reasonably expect the decision taken by UCL to occur. It seems unreasonable to have to pay for accommodation during an exam period that will no longer occur.
Our colleagues at Queen Mary university have been able to be exit their contracts, and so I am requesting that you follow the precedent set by a fellow University of London member.
Yours sincerely,","#UCLove69610

Hi guys! I just created a website for free food delivery for those people who are at higher risk of contracting coronavirus. I would be forever grateful if you could please share the link with your friends as I’m currently looking for some volunteers who would be happy to do the shopping and deliver the food. So many elderly people are too scared to go outside and I can completely understand them. I myself have a 70-year-old dad who locked himself up at our apartment and if he has me to get the food for him, some elderly people might have no one... Thank you 🙏🏼

I've been crying all night and I haven't really slept. I feel my ptsd starting to kick back in too. I feel alone and I think self isolating is going to be awful for mental wellbeing. I have a fear that someone is going to break in and harm me and I know it is irrational but I can't stop thinking about it. I think I'm going to go crazy.
I feel so homesick but I think my mum does have underlying health conditions and the last thing I want to do is infect her, I couldn't live with that. I know they want to see me, and I really want to see them, I miss them so much.
I decided a while back to stay in my student accomodation and not to go back home until i know that I wouldn't be infecting anyone. I'm scared that I am asymptomatic and I would hate to be a transmitter of coronavirus to anybody. I know from a previous trauma that I carry guilt really quickly and it becomes a long term pain for me. So it's a lose-lose situation whether or not I go back. My worry is that some of my flatmates are staying for now, but deep down I think they all will go. I really fear being alone. Since a traumatic incident two years ago that left me with PTSD, anxiety and insomnia, I've had to really work on my mental wellbeing and I have a feeling that all my progress is going to unravel and Im scared of not having the strength to get better. I also have done any proper uni work lately but it's something that I've come to accept. I'm really bad at reaching out for help, I'm just hoping that somebody has some advice. Thanks so much.","#UCLove69575

I’m a final year international student overwhelmed with emotions as I leave London, not knowing when I’ll be back or see any of my friends again, knowing that university is basically over, but I just want to address everyone freaking out about fees and online exams:
1. UCL in no way is liable to give you a refund. This situation isn’t something they could somehow have avoided. I
Would you rather they go ahead with classes?
2. Exams are likely to be more leniently marked and externally examined due to the circumstances they were taken in. I’m reasonably sure that our lecturers are more worried than we are, so we must have faith that they will do what’s best for us.
3. It’s incredibly selfish to say exams should be cancelled instead of moved online and graduation delayed — some of us have jobs and masters degrees to go to and I speak for my friends as well as myself when I say that we’re so so so thankful that UCL is caring about our health and safety while also ensuring we’re able to graduate as planned. Not being able to do that would be catastrophic.","#UCLove69507

Anyone else really nervous about online exams?? I find it so much harder to concentrate at home compared to in an actual exam hall, and I hate doing my exams from a screen rather than paper. Also, if it ends up being open book (because how are they going to monitor it), I'm worried they'll make it unbelievably time-pressured to solve this, which makes everything so much more stressful. Every online assessment I've done this year has gone shit for this reason.
Anyone else think they should genuinely consider just scrapping exams this year because it won't properly assess how well we know content and is totally unfair because it's so different to past years. Or at least reduce the weighting of this year for the overall degree. If anyone else has ideas to get around the issues with online testing please comment and we might be able to posit solutions to department heads.","#UCLove69371

Wearing a face mask to protect myself and others, at the same time I’d like to think of it as a social experiment.
Instead had a very unpleasant journey home yesterday. Walking down Tottenham Court Road minding my own business and this guy came at my face saying “you brought the coronavirus here what are you wearing a face mask for”.
You heard the tube: see it, say it, (even if it doesn’t get) sorted.
Contribute to the ‘stats’, you’d be surprised how often they get quoted.

Someone approached me near cruciform and claims his bags got stole and need some money to take the tube and all in his possession are his keys and an oyster card.
He or she might claim she works nearby (eg in euston).
Here are some tips:
1. Never give them cash, eg tell them you dont carry any
2. Ask them where do they work and live and call the place to see they actually work there
3. Ask them some simple questions such as which direction places are and what not
4. Question why they are here at your current location

We will be here all week, all day and all of the night, and would appreciate all the support we can get.",,1584050448,https://scontent.fhfa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/89266449_2587390578039157_516422933480996864_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=NkqV1_gNHyoAX_Vlngo&_nc_ht=scontent.fhfa1-2.fna&tp=14&oh=54deb1a75bdb63abf80d47696b6e0a18&oe=5F4355BF,,21,19,0,,

Being in a relationship with someone who’s so insecure is too mentally exhausting. I can’t seem to eliminate her insecurities and it makes me feel pretty hopeless and brings me down. It doesn’t help that she seems to habitually bring my own self confidence down in order to make herself feel more normal about herself. I kind of want a break from her but I know that if I bring that idea up, it would completely set her off and I’ll be made to feel like I’m selfish and as if I don’t care about her, whilst at the same time shattering her confidence further and confirming her abandonment insecurity. What the fuck do I do? I really do care for her but being in a relationship with her is so taxing on my mental health and I don’t know how I’ll be able to handle this anymore, especially with exam season coming up.

Hey everyone! It's me, duck girl, back to announce that I have my own ducks now!! Meet Sir Francis Drake and Mr Darcy, two absolutely stunning Indian Runner ducks that I would actually die for!!! Their favourite activities include rootling around in a bucket full of mud and grass, running around their temporary pen (we haven't finished the proper one yet) and tripping up all the time, preening, and watching the pheasants run past their pen.
Once the main pen is finished we will be able to get five more drakes from a local rescue - we're having a little bachelor flock! - three more runners, a pekin and a chunky Aylesbury with arthritis called Mr Beep Beep! I'm living my best life.","#UCLove68916

I have tried my best to engage with people, to make friends, to take part in as many societies I can (realistically), but the past one year has been the one of the most depressing time of my life. All my efforts have failed, and I no longer enjoy my classes or my course, I have no friends and I have lost the will to do pretty much everything. Not a day goes by when I am contemplating whether to kill myself or not, and while I try my best to put up a brave face everyday, I'm being eaten alive on the inside.

Trigger Warning: depression

I've had depression since first year, I'm now in third year and i've been going to therapy for a year now. Although therapy was incredibly helpful the past month has been very hard and it affected my studies. I know that if I continue like this I might not graduate or risk doing very badly, wasting the past 3 years of hard work. I'm thinking of taking antidepressants but I've read that it takes months to get used to them and for them to actually be helpful. Given that I have only 2 and a half months left until my degree is over I'm worried that the side effects will just disorient me even more than depression itself. I know that different medication has different effects and the best thing to do is consult my gp but I'd like to gain some insight on how the first period of taking the antidepressants really is before starting to pursue this option so if anyone feels comfortable sharing their experience it would be really helpful.","#UCLove68706

** JOB APPLICATION ALERT**
My friend is so annoying, they always turn a two-person motive into a group motive so I need someone who will go to the cinema with me and help me use my 2 for £7 voucher codes every 2 weeks without hassle. In return, I will give you at least two weeks advance notice for a film of my choice, but you must not talk to me unless I speak to you first or give you permission. In addition, you must pay me £3.50 each time we go see a film so we go even. I will not buy you drinks or popcorn. You're probably wondering why don't I just take a girl, sorry no can do because that isn't allowed. If I had a woman, I would. If you meet the criteria, you'll be selected via pm.","#UCLove68698

Can people please stop 'glorifying' procrastination?
It doesn't make you funky or edgy. It also (contrary to popular belief) doesn't make it more impressive if you do well in your subject/a test. Especially when you say you're not working hard at all, if you are or are not, and then brag about your results.
Some people with cognitive disorders genuinely find it very hard to get down to work, and might have to put in 10x more hours than you to get the same grade. I know in an academic environment people enjoy competing and 'getting one over' on each other - and that's totally fine!

What if he actually doesn’t want to be argumentative to his real partner? Have you ever asked like ‘why you are so argumentative to me?’. Some ppl may have a defensive mechanism due to past memories. If you like him, you can listen to him. Unless you talk, no one knows. I can tel you this because it’s my partner’s case. Some people are just born to be argumentative. But some of them are not. They have some complex history behind their stance. Open and talk. Will give you the real world. But even though he becomes not argumentative, it doesn’t mean that what you say is always right. Don’t be a bitch. Bitch doesn’t deserve a good boy anyway. But If he says he has no problematic history or trauma, guess he’s also dickhead. Recommend you to move on .

Aight fellas,
What's the BBC doing? Is this a sick joke?
Check it out:
Pls see attached img.
GTA IV which can be seen in the image, was not released on the PlayStation 2.
The controller seen in the picture is a six axis controller, not dualshock 2. This is clear from the fact that a wire cannot be seen coming out of the controller, and more obviously from the circular PlayStation home button. The dual shock 2 did not have these features.
Therefore they were using a PlayStation 3 in the image.
The PlayStation 2 recently turned 20. Show some respect you twats.","#UCLove68627

I am so sorry that this is an event promotion post/fundraising ask and not a confession, but hope that you'll read on anyway <3
Are you Filipino and want to help support an awesome cultural festival with games, activities, and food all about the Philippines? Are you not Filipino but want to know more about the culture and support something that UCL students (and other uni students from around the UK) have worked really hard on? Then this is the post for you.
FiliFest is a Filipino cultural festival organised by students from universities around the UK and is happening for the second time this summer at UCL!
We would love to see members of the UCL community there (exact date TBA but tentatively 6th of June)! I am actually making this post to ask for your guys' help to fundraise the event. It is 100% student organised and student run so we could use all the help we could get. Even if it's just £1 or £2, any help would be very much appreciated!
The link to the FiliFest trailer, social media details, and the fundraiser can be found below. If you got this far, thank you for reading!

Can HINDUSOC and INDIANSOC organise a MOVIE NIGHT pls? I saw the recent UCLove post about Bollywood’s first gay rom-com (SHUBH MANGAL ZYADA SAAVDHAN) and I’ve really wanted to watch it!
It would be great if y’all can stream it in a lecture theatre, have some snacks and play this film as it is BIG NEWS for India and Hinduism and the LGBT community I feel and it’s time us youth - the younger generation - are normalised to these ideas and support our friends who are struggling. Just a bit of relaxation before we get stuck into deadlines and exam season. I have gay and bi friends who are still in the closet because they feel they lack indian/south Asian representation. An event like this would be great!!

Anyone out there who is hella confused by their sexuality? Im a 21 year old guy, not out to many people, but I think I’m bisexual, but not fully gay. I’m mostly into men, wanna be with them sexually and date them too. I always notice guys more, but some girls are fire 😍. The only thing is that I can’t imagine sexually satisfying them (never been with a girl, but my hookups have always been guys) or being with them in the long term. Polyamory exists, but I’m more monogamous, and I guess you can’t marry a man and a woman. 🤔
Ramblings of my ‘fragile bisexuality’ or ‘sexual fluidity’. Whatever you call it, I’m probably going to end up with a guy (99%)... or a girl(1%)... damn bisexuality is hard.","#UCLove68295

In a state of constant existential crisis. I like this uni. I like my course. And yet, it feels like something's missing. And I don't really know what it is. Maybe it's just that I don't have a girlfriend and I would really like one, but then that's not the only thing on my mind either. The future just generally seems bleak, and I'm anxious about it. This crisis was out to get me since I did my GCSEs, but I've just been putting it off. I told myself to focus on A levels and then life would be good once I got to uni. And so I struggled through 2 gruelling years of 4 A levels, 2 of which were in subjects I wasn't even interested in by the time I got to year 13. I got my As and A*s, and I got into UCL. But now that I'm here, although it is a great uni, it's kind of just the same. You're set work and you're expected to do it. Ok so there's more flexibility etc but either way you're given work to do, you do the work, and you go home. And when you get home, you're just so alone until you go into uni the next day. And then when you graduate and get a job, it's more or less the same thing, except that you get paid for it too. Is this all there is to it? Is this what I'm meant to do for the next 50 years and then die? Something needs to change. I'm certainly not going to kill myself, but I'm not entirely sure what I want to do with my life either. But I want to do something before I develop unhealthy coping mechanisms.

In a state of constant existential crisis. I like this uni. I like my course. And yet, it feels like something's missing. And I don't really know what it is. Maybe it's just that I don't have a girlfriend and I would really like one, but then that's not the only thing on my mind either. The future just generally seems bleak, and I'm anxious about it. This crisis was out to get me since I did my GCSEs, but I've just been putting it off. I told myself to focus on A levels and then life would be good once I got to uni. And so I struggled through 2 gruelling years of 4 A levels, 2 of which were in subjects I wasn't even interested in by the time I got to year 13. I got my As and A*s, and I got into UCL. But now that I'm here, although it is a great uni, it's kind of just the same. You're set work and you're expected to do it. Ok so there's more flexibility etc but either way you're given work to do, you do the work, and you go home. And when you get home, you're just so alone until you go into uni the next day.

Today when I was walking on the street, some HKers suddenly turning to me saying I should go back to where I come from.
Tell me if I’m wrong. I just got a feeling that some people from HK just think so high of themselves and try so hard to discriminate others even by making fun of their English ability ( I saw on ucl love).
We all people, we have feelings. Let alone different political opinions, should we show some basic respect to each other?
personally I think it’s totally fine people have different political views, and I am willing to listen and understand. Many mainlanders actually are not sure what is really going on and they also question about the news from both of the sides. but they don’t post much and don’t talk too much to strangers. That’s probably why you have a stereotype of mainlanders are sort of nationalists.
Please don’t attack or insult others like that. It hurts. The more anger and hostility we hold towards each other the less we can truely listen.","#UCLove60716

So I like a guy who’s probably attracted to me but hasn’t figured out the nature of relationships yet. He thinks he’ll find a girl who’s literally perfect and checks every box on his list (which is pretty much impossible). Ergo, he’s a little immature. He’s almost waiting for a Disney princess to show up and be seduced by him. On the other hand, we’ve been friends since forever, and always gravitated towards each other. Lately, he has become flirtier than before but still a long wait to go.
It’s a pretty painful process for me, I’m almost in the friendzone but I can’t let him go, because whenever we meet, he’s flirting unconsciously.
Ladies, who’s been in a similar situation, should I run or is it worth waiting?","#UCLove60715

Just saw a HK protestor’s proposal that the student Union should support their freedom movement.
Srsly? Do you think all people would acquiesce and let you distort all the speeches in the name of ‘freedom’?
Just some simple facts about this riot which you may verify on fb videos if you want.
1. The protectors/rioters set university campuses and streets on fire. (Arson)
2. They killed a dissendent, hitting a 70 year old man with a brick in his head leaving him in ICU braindead. (Murder)
3. They set fire on a dissendent. ( Attemped Murder)
4. They menaced the police’s children who are still in schools.
I acknowledge that freedom is an ideal pursuit, BUT
#Freedom does not mean setting people on fire#
#Freedom does not mean setting schools on fire#
People do look on news from both sides and most importantly if you don’t believe either, look at third party
You may want to watch Deustche Welle’s interview on their ‘leader’ before making your judgment.

Imagine if boris johnson proposed a new law and the whole of Greater London, West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Hampshire protested peacefully and said “hey we don’t want it”. But not only did the police shoot you with a bunch of tear gas and rubber bullets to make you go away, boris simply said “okay I’ll put it on hold but it doesn’t mean I won’t bring it up again”.
That’s essentially what happened and is still happening in Hong Kong.
First things first I would like to make it clear that independence is NOT demanded. So mainlanders who don’t have a clear understanding about the demands please sit down.
The protests have been going on for almost 6 months and I think at this point we can’t just look at the incidents separately. It’s obviously wrong to set roadblocks and throw Molotov cocktails but we must remember that the protests were peaceful when it first started in June. One million HKers made it clear that they were against the extradition law yet their voices weren’t even acknowledged. HK is a small city with approximately 7 million citizens. One million people in HK demonstrating is almost like the whole London protesting. But the government ignored these voices.
HKers have displayed their capability to march and demonstrate peacefully but the government and police responded with violence. Tear gas and rubber bullets were fired at protesters who were not posing a threat, who were retreating, who were not showing any sign of aggression.
Now I’m not saying protesters are not violent at all. Bricks and Molotov cocktails were thrown, the legislative council was stormed and trashed, police have been injured etc. I personally don’t always agree with protesters’ actions but I can understand why they did it. Up to two million people spoke out against the extradition bill peacefully and the government still didn’t take public opinions seriously. What would you do if it happened to you?
Some people think HKers are only protesting because we are sinophobic so we are against anything associated with China. I can’t speak for everyone but personally I do not want to be associated with the Chinese communist party. I don’t dislike China as a country. I love our history and culture. But I do not support the Chinese communist party. The party that rules and controls its people with oppression and lies, bans all religion and locks millions of Muslims in concentration camps, “re-educate” Muslims by forcing them to eat pork, learn mandarin, rape them, inject them with unknown drugs and even murder them. Thanks but no thanks. I would like to keep my freedom of speech and rights to criticise the government.
I always see comments such as “those rioters have been so violent and destructive they should be arrested and punished”. But thousands of people have been arrested, even people who were just passing by. The youngest arrested is 11 and the oldest is in their 80s. On the other hand, the police have been abusing their power and weapons, forcing their way into private premises without a warrant, attacking journalists and deliberately running protesters over with vehicles. Now I could bang on about the countless incidents of police brutality but if you’re interested, you can search it up on Twitter and instagram. Thousands of protesters have been arrested and not even one police officer has been punished for their actions.
This blatant corruption is why the protests are escalating. The government tried to silence opposing opinions the CCP way - oppression and violence.
Peoples’ lives are disrupted and it’s easy to blame the protesters, saying they are ruining the society and economy. But who wouldn’t rather hang out with friends, stay in bed and enjoy their youth than to risk their lives and be bombarded with cyanide and dioxin? This isn’t fun but it’s necessary. If we don’t fight now, it’s going to be impossible in the future.
If you’re still reading, thank you, and please stand with Hong Kong.

A while back there was this post that was a bit unsympathetic towards leave voters who now seem to be shocked that brexit is not some kind of fairytale. I just want to say I really don't understand some of the comments. For example, the one starting with ""Maybe if you stepped off your high horse to examine the harsh economic conditions of those who voted for Brexit"". I, as an EU citizen, really don't have to be understanding of those people. Moreover, don't you think it's a bit offensive that you seem to be suggesting that because of someone's socio-economic background they wouldn't be able to make proper decisions. Adults are adults and they should be held accountable for their decisions. If they were children, they wouldn't be allowed to vote. In this world, we are judged by our decisions. It's perfectly fine to judge someone who voted for Brexit. It was their decision. Yes, politicians were misleading. But, ultimately, they were adults who made their own decisions and are now whining gloriously about it.","#UCLove54783

Why are gender identity and sexuality grouped under the same term 'LGBTQ+'. I say this as a gay man who is a supporter of the trans community. While both communities still have a long way to go in terms of equality, the LGB definitely has a lot more recognition and has received a lot more attention in recent years, whilst I feel it is much harder to be a member of the trans community in today's society. I worry that we hail LGBT progress when we are actually only really seeing progress for the LGB community and the trans community is being left behind. But because they all come under the same banner we forget about trans issues.
Also sexuality and gender identity are two completely separate issues. Yes, gay people can support the trans community (and vice versa) but we will never truly understand what it means to question your gender identity. The label LGBTQ+ feels to me like ""Oh these people aren't 'normal' let's shove them all under the same label"".","#UCLove52803

I'm going to explode about these posts I'm seeing. FREE PALESTINE IS NOT ANTI SEMITIC IN ANY WAY.
To say free Palestine is to stand in solidarity with the innocent people being killed everyday for being who they are. They're imprisoned and ill-treated for being who they are. Free Palestine is to stand with our fellow brothers and sisters against this injustice, it is not anti-Semitic- the judgement or prejudice of Jews, it is anti hate, anti murder. The occupation of Palestine by Israeli forces is unlawful, people are being kicked out of their homes, people are not allowed to go to the mosque to pray, being are bombed during the holiest month. People are fighting everyday to be who they are without judgement. Free Palestine is not exclusively against Jews it is against the inhumane actions occuring everyday. Even Jews say free Palestine. It's not against Jews but against the treatment of the Palestinian people. They're humans who deserve the freedom to live too.

Trigger Warning: anxiety, exam stress
.
.
.
.
Hi, I've been putting of posting this but I can't any longer. My mental health hasn't been great since starting uni (particularly on the anxiety front) and alongside this I have unhealthy coping mechanisms which hinder my ability to get much work done during term time. I then beat myself up mentally because of it all. I feel like over the past year in particular (2nd year), I'm just lost within myself and that I've lost track of what I truly want in life. To top it all off, there are 2 exams in particular (out of the remaining ones I have) which I'm so anxious about (I've had a few breakdowns, periods of negative thoughts, etc.) that I continue to procrastinate studying for them, and whenever I do sit down to try and do work for those modules, I just mentally can't bring myself to do it because of how fearful I feel. I just don't know what to do I want to defer but I just don't know whether it's possible","#UCLove51252

I then beat myself up mentally because of it all. I feel like over the past year in particular (2nd year), I'm just lost within myself and that I've lost track of what I truly want in life. To top it all off, there are 2 exams in particular (out of the remaining ones I have) which I'm so anxious about (I've had a few breakdowns, periods of negative thoughts, etc.) that I continue to procrastinate studying for them, and whenever I do sit down to try and do work for those modules, I just mentally can't bring myself to do it because of how fearful I feel. I just don't know what to do I want to defer but I just don't know whether it's possible",,1556381354,,,5,2,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1995261980585356&id=1310505995727628,

Helped me capture this on the 2nd floor, Anthropology, of the science library. Been like this for a good half hour or so watching some series. Did not comment and will not comment to to this person to stop this because I believe (or believed) every student at UCL has the intellectual capacity and decency to not do something like this.
I dont know what kind of barn this person was raised in, but I know my parents would give me a whooping for this. How can someone not give even a shred of a thought for others who will be sitting there after them? If you want to watch your series in comfort, do it at home, on your couch that I hope you dont share with others.
The library being quiet does not mean it became your flat.","#UCLove49239

The people I thought I was genuinely close to abandoned me the moment I became the slightest bit inconvenient to them. Every interaction I have with doctors is full of gaslighting and patronisation.

Right next to Old Street station, arriving at UCL in about 10 minutes (Northern line)
It's a modern, spacious room with its own kitchen.
Shoreditch is a great area for nights out and also has many great areas for studying nearby.
The staff are friendly and relaxed (with 24hr reception).
The price is £329 a week, a discount may be negotiable.

I really need to upgrade my German speaking for my upcoming exam and i would like to trade German discussion classess for French tutoring sessions.
It could go as following: 20 minutes German / 20 minutes French for 1h - 1h30, 2 or 3 times a week. I suck at German so you'd have to be pretty patient.
Comment if you'd be down (if have experience tutoring French and could be of a nice help as well).","#UCLove47786

Coming from an extremely conservative society, just a friendly word of caution for people with the view, ""The female only gym-hours are just few hours, Get Over Yourself or Make a Sacrifice etc"".
In my 30yrs there, I have seen how these small steps of segregation cascade into steps resulting in a completely divided society where even having a conversation or a hello with your colleague from opposite gender becomes a suspicious act (while typing this, saw #UCLove47480 suggesting men-only gym hours!). It always starts with 'its not a big deal', so just be aware.
Do not be dismissive of the underlying principle till it becomes an issue which you can not undo even if you wish to.","#UCLove47645

A story of the pitfalls of ketamine:
So there I was, ketty as fuck and stumbling around the Titan warehouse in a confused haze. I’ve lost my friends, I’m all alone and I’m a mess so I sit down in the corner of the building and sober up a bit.I decide my nights over and it’s time to get to the safety of my house so I leave and order an Uber.
A girl sidles up to me and we start chatting. She’s fit and quite funny, out of my league you might say. She asks if she can hop in my Uber, to which I begrudgingly say yes, believing, like the innocent soul I am, that she just didn’t want to pay for her own taxi.
I’m in the front still so ketty that I can barely ask the driver if he’s been busy. Meanwhile she’s in the back minding her own business. He drops us off and she says ‘it’s still early, you could come round for a cup of tea’. Ahah so that’s where we are heading is it!
We go back to hers and she makes a banging cup of tea, perfect colour, I remember thinking it was one of the best I’ve ever had. We start cuddling on the sofa and I start to think about making a move but I’m not one to waste a good cuppa so I bide my time.
She switches on the tv and asks if I like Louis Theroux. Now I’m a big fan of Louis and she says she hasn’t seen his new documentary so I say by all means stick it on! If only it was one of his light hearted ones, the old ones that everyone prefers, but no luck. It was on rape and sexual assault on university campuses. So there we are watching Louis grill a guy on whether it’s right to have sex with a girl who’s intoxixated, whilst we are snuggled up, me on ket and her on Mandy, both trying to pretend this isn’t incredibly awkward.
As you can imagine, this isn’t the best background noise to go for the kiss. Nothing kills the mood like hearing about several cases of rape. So I wait, we watch the whole thing and it ends and then I make my move. My patience paid off.
She invites me to bed and I say I need the toilet first. My ketty bladder however has other ideas and won’t relieve itself for around 10mins. She clearly thinks I’m having a shit, especially since I have to tear off some toilet paper to wipe up the evidence of my wayward aim.
We go upstairs, she says: we aren’t having sex.
I think: well it’s international woman’s day, and I’m nothing if not a feminist so I give her head for a good while, I’m feeling pretty proud of myself. She’s moaning and playing with my hair, it’s all going to plan. I pull up and ask if she’s still sure about no sex. She says ‘well it seems a bit silly not to now’ and I nearly cum in my pants on the spot.
Alas, my old friend ketamina set out to sabotage me when I trusted him most. I’m struggling to get more then the soft-side of a semi. I persevere. I adapt. I get The condom ready, position her beneath me in the most conservative of positions, good old missionary. My penis has a rush of blood and I slip the condom on and shove it in the craved opening in one slick movement.
Bingo, I’m a way, I know what I’m doing, stick to missionary for now, missionary is easy. The ploughing commences. I’m loving it, she doesn’t seem to be hating it, everyone’s happy. My mind wanders and I start considering a future career in the porn industry.
I feel my dick softening inside her and decide I better pull out in order to revive him and not suffer the embarrassment of going soft mid plough. I’m desperately wanking trying to get hard, she’s a bit confused, again I adapt, ‘flip over’ I say, ‘I’ll fuck you in doggy’. I try to stuff my flaccid penis into her but it’s so soft that it’s folding up on itself.
At this point I had disappointed her enough it would seem, as she decided to take the reigns. She discovers the situation I am in and with an exasperated sigh pulls off the condom and says ‘maybe lay off the ket’. I nod, a piece of my soul dies and I’m greeted by the familiar gut punch of sexual inadequacy and embarrassment, to which I have become so well accustomed.
We spoon, it’s nice but neither of us really gets any sleep. My dick decides to get hard at around 2am and I jab it suggestively into her lower back a few times. She doesn’t respond. I give up and try to sleep but don’t succeed.
The 7am alarm bleeps and I role out of bed, get changed and gather my things. She gives me a goodbye kiss and says ‘Nice to meet you’. I hear: ‘please fuck off’
I stand and my heart sinks when I see on her desk the greys anatomy flash cards which every medic buys in first year and then proceeds to never look at. ‘Oh, are you a medic too?’ I ask, ‘yh I told you this last night’ she replies. I Facebook her and see we have about 50 mutual friends. Another piece of my soul dies.
I slink off into the early Saturday morning light, with no sleep and only half a shag. Terrific.
As a result of all this, it’s with a heavy heart I have decided that me and ketamine must go our separate ways. I shall miss you, old friend.
And to the cute medic who just wanted to take home a boy with a functioning sexual organ: I am deeply sorry.
Call me??","#UCLove47607

She invites me to bed and I say I need the toilet first. My ketty bladder however has other ideas and won’t relieve itself for around 10mins. She clearly thinks I’m having a shit, especially since I have to tear off some toilet paper to wipe up the evidence of my wayward aim.
We go upstairs, she says: we aren’t having sex.
I think: well it’s international woman’s day, and I’m nothing if not a feminist so I give her head for a good while, I’m feeling pretty proud of myself. She’s moaning and playing with my hair, it’s all going to plan. I pull up and ask if she’s still sure about no sex. She says ‘well it seems a bit silly not to now’ and I nearly cum in my pants on the spot.
Alas, my old friend ketamina set out to sabotage me when I trusted him most. I’m struggling to get more then the soft-side of a semi. I persevere. I adapt. I get The condom ready, position her beneath me in the most conservative of positions, good old missionary. My penis has a rush of blood and I slip the condom on and shove it in the craved opening in one slick movement.
Bingo, I’m a way, I know what I’m doing, stick to missionary for now, missionary is easy. The ploughing commences. I’m loving it, she doesn’t seem to be hating it, everyone’s happy. My mind wanders and I start considering a future career in the porn industry.
I feel my dick softening inside her and decide I better pull out in order to revive him and not suffer the embarrassment of going soft mid plough. I’m desperately wanking trying to get hard, she’s a bit confused, again I adapt, ‘flip over’ I say, ‘I’ll fuck you in doggy’. I try to stuff my flaccid penis into her but it’s so soft that it’s folding up on itself.
At this point I had disappointed her enough it would seem, as she decided to take the reigns. She discovers the situation I am in and with an exasperated sigh pulls off the condom and says ‘maybe lay off the ket’. I nod, a piece of my soul dies and I’m greeted by the familiar gut punch of sexual inadequacy and embarrassment, to which I have become so well accustomed.
We spoon, it’s nice but neither of us really gets any sleep. My dick decides to get hard at around 2am and I jab it suggestively into her lower back a few times. She doesn’t respond. I give up and try to sleep but don’t succeed.
The 7am alarm bleeps and I role out of bed, get changed and gather my things. She gives me a goodbye kiss and says ‘Nice to meet you’. I hear: ‘please fuck off’
I stand and my heart sinks when I see on her desk the greys anatomy flash cards which every medic buys in first year and then proceeds to never look at. ‘Oh, are you a medic too?’ I ask, ‘yh I told you this last night’ she replies. I Facebook her and see we have about 50 mutual friends. Another piece of my soul dies.
I slink off into the early Saturday morning light, with no sleep and only half a shag. Terrific.
As a result of all this, it’s with a heavy heart I have decided that me and ketamine must go our separate ways. I shall miss you, old friend.
And to the cute medic who just wanted to take home a boy with a functioning sexual organ: I am deeply sorry.

Alright kiddos, buckle up [technically y'all are older than me, but I'm dropping the edumacation rn, so listen up!]
All this about priviledge and racism and whatever else y'all have been hollering... It's getting out of hand.
We're all UCL students, and we are all going to be amongst the best at whatever we do. I don't need to know about where y'all came from or whatever and likewise my personal life needn't make any difference to you guys.
Naturally, certain social factors and genetic components do make life ""easier"" or ""harder"" for some people compared to others, but that's inevitable. I could have been born Bill Gate's son, but I wasn't. I can't control it, and whatever I do won't change my heritage and any privilege I may or may not have received.
Quite frankly, there's no point wasting your energy and thought into things that people can't influence. It's worth more than that. Be proud of what you've achieved on your own accord, and leave other people's lives to them. I don't give a bollocks whether you came from Eton, Ilford or Sri Lanka, I just look at the person in front of me. If they're a piece of work to me, then regardless of who they are, I just won't fuck with them, and they'll explicitly be told why. But equally, if they show me love, I'll be there for them and then some.
About your questions,OP...
You've got the clear insight that being judgemental or making assumptions about people are to be avoided, from which your questions kind of answer themselves really. Just because you don't know things about people doesn't mean you have to automatically just jump to conclusions to fill in those gaps in knowledge - part of getting to know someone is to become comfortable with them and how they communicate with you.
For some people, you might find that they reveal a lot of small things about themselves indirectly, or maybe they just might talk a lot and just tell you things upfront. Other times you might be able to ask them for things you're unsure about in their life.
Just be respectful about it, and if you're unsure there is no real harm in respectfully asking them for some clarification about something you want to know about them. Most people will be happy to tell you these things, provided you don't pry into their personal lives and don't have some weird hidden motive behind knowing.
But also consider this, if you've truly done your best to be considerate towards this other person, and they still have a problem with it, then clearly such a friendship or whatever wouldn't have really worked, because at some level you two just don't see things eye to eye, and at some point the diference in perspectives and behaviours would have flared up. Better to see it early and leave things be than to make some phoned-in attempt to not have your ""friendship"" pop off.
All in all? Value the human being, not what made them. You can't go wrong with that.
People are nice enough if you give them a chance and treat them with dignity, and if not, walk away.
Sincerely,
Stan

Sometimes it can be like that. I recently met a girl from home who likes me and I really like her too, she's really kind and sweet and I think she's good for me - we've been texting for a while now. But at the moment my life just revolves around sleeping, eating and studying at the moment, I don't step out of the house. She asked me if I wanted to meet up for a drink but studying is my priority and I can't see myself getting out of this routine. I feel too busy to date this person or anyone as a matter of fact. But that doesn't mean I'm not interested in her or getting to know this person or eventually having her as my girlfriend. What should I do? I don't feel like I'm ready to date this person yet but just want to talk and see what happens, but I'm worried that she might loose interest and I'll lose her! I don't know what to do because I've been in the opposite situation in the past too and it'd suck to be her! HELP!","#UCLove36591

“You’re a wizard, Harry,” Hagrid said. “And you’re coming to Hogwarts.”
“What’s Hogwarts?” Harry asked.
“It’s wizard school.”
“It’s not a public school, is it?”
“No, it’s privately run.”
“Good. Then I accept. Children are not the property of the state; everyone who wishes to do so has the right to offer educational goods or services at a fair market rate. Let us leave at once.”
“Malfoy bought the whole team brand-new Nimbus Cleansweeps!” Ron said, like a poor person. “That’s not fair!”
“Everything that is possible is fair,” Harry reminded him gently. “If he is able to purchase better equipment, that is his right as an individual. How is Draco’s superior purchasing ability qualitatively different from my superior Snitch-catching ability?”
“I guess it isn’t,” Ron said crossly.
Harry laughed, cool and remote, like if a mountain were to laugh. “Someday you’ll understand, Ron.”
Professor Snape stood at the front of the room. “There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don’t expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess, the predisposition…I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death.”
Harry’s hand shot up.
“What is it, Potter?” Snape asked, irritated.
“What’s the value of these potions on the open market?”
“What?”
“Why are you teaching children how to make these valuable products for ourselves at a schoolteacher’s salary instead of creating products to meet modern demand?”
“You impertinent boy–“
“Conversely, what’s to stop me from selling these potions myself after you teach us how to master them?”
“I–“
“This is really more of a question for the Economics of Potion-Making, I guess. What time are econ lessons here?”
“We have no economics lessons in this school, you ridiculous boy.”
Harry Potter stood up bravely. “We do now. Come with me if you want to learn about market forces!”
The students poured into the hallway after him. They had a leader at last.
Harry and Ron stood before the Mirror of Erised. “My God,” Ron said. “Harry, it’s your dead parents.”
Harry’s eyes flicked momentarily over to the mirror. “So it is. This information is neither useful nor productive. Let us leave at once, to assist Hagrid in his noble enterprise of raising as many dragon eggs as he sees fit, in spite of our country’s unjust dragon-trading restrictions.”
“But it’s your parents, Harry,” Ron said. Ron never really got it.
Harry sighed. “The fundamental standard for all relationships is the trader principle, Ron.”
“I don’t understand,” Ron said.
“Of course you don’t,” said Harry affectionately. “This principle holds that we should interact with people on the basis of the values we can trade with them – values of all sorts, including common interests in art, sports or music, similar philosophical outlooks, political beliefs, sense of life, and more. Dead people have no value according to the trader principle.”
“But they gave birth to y–“
“I made myself, Ron,” Harry said firmly.
“Give me your wand, boy,” Voldemort hissed.
“I cannot do that. This wand represents my wealth, which is itself a tangible result of my achievements. Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think,” Harry said bravely.
Voldemort gasped.
“There is a level of cowardice lower than that of the conformist: the fashionable non-conformist.”
Voldemort began to melt. Harry lit a cigarette, because he was the master of fire.
“The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities. The minimum wage is a tax on the successful. The market will naturally dictate the minimum wage without the government stepping in to determine arbitrary limits.”
Voldemort howled.
“I’m going to sell copies of my wand at an enormous markup,” Harry said, “and you can buy one like everyone else.”
Voldemort had been defeated.
“He hated us for our freedom,” Ron said.
“No, Ron,” Harry said. “He hated us for our free markets.”
Hermione ached with desire for the both of them to master her, but nobody paid her any attention. They had empires to build.","#UCLove36559

Tried to quit smoking for ages always relapsed, I tried everything like vaping, patches,gum, cold turkey and theh worked but after a month or two back at it. I always thought using nicotine to quite was stupid as your using the same drug to get off a drug.
But nicotine is an essential thing in my life, the stimulant. I am addicted to it for sure but now i've given vaping a more sincere shot and its going well. I think I'm on the path to quit smoking and hopefully nicotine.
The way i see it now is i'd rather be addicted to something with less harmful effect, cold turkey is defo the most effective way but when stress comes up its too easy to revert.
If you wanna quit i would say give vaping a go it is the lesser of two evils.
With decisions like this you gotta know why you wanna do it. For me its to live longer i got too much I want to do with my life and its already short as it is. I have family and people that I care about and people who don't even exist yet that I will care about and I want to spend as much time as I can with them.
If your friend is trying to quit don't give them ciggerettes just say no cos they do want it and tobacco has got that taste and flavour that a vape just can't deliver so yeah there is still cravings.","#UCLove36172

Before I start, this does not reflect my views on homeless people in general. Only a select few.
I've been at UCL for about two years now. In my first week, I was with a friend and was approached by a homeless woman who told me her story and basically asked for money. I said I had no change and only had money in my card but my friend gave her a couple of pounds. She then turned to us and asked us for more and said to me ""there's an atm nearby, we can go there and you can withdraw the money"". At which point I walked away and didn't think much of it.
Up until today where I saw the same woman doing the exact same thing to other people in the area. What I don't get is how this person has made zero progress in their life over these two years. I decided to stand nearby having my lunch and eavesdropped and her story was the same word to word. What little shred of sympathy I had got lost instantly since she appears to be a professional rather than someone in genuine need of help.
I'll probably be judged for writing this but beginning to lose sympathy for the homeless people around UCL since I've been seeing the same people for the past two years. How has nothing been done to help their situation? Is it a case of people unwilling to change or our government being shit?","#UCLove35819

I am so in love with this guy. When he holds me I feel like I can finally breathe again, like my world is at peace. We can talk for hours and hours and spend so much time together. But… he has a girlfriend. We’ve never done anything sexual but he only mentions her to me to complain about her all the time. She’s not in London so I don’t know if he’s affection deprived or if he genuinely likes me but I’m falling so hard for him. I also can’t help but feel like if I was prettier, he would be more into me. I don’t want to sound crazy and obsessive but I know there’s something there from the way he talks to me and touches me, but I don’t want to risk losing our friendship and making things awkward by saying anything. Help.","#UCLove35362

I know it's a sensitive issue for people, and of course no one should have to feel awful about their image. But 'bodypositivity' can also lead to the trap of embracing an unhealthy life. Being very overweight has clear risks and dangers associated with it, not to mention costs to others in the form of socialized healthcare. It's fine to be positive about yourself, but it would be foolish to use that as a reason to do nothing about your weight.

There's a problem with this transphobia debate. Let's set the scene here. I'm a straight male. Straight means I am attracted to females, and I don't want to touch someone's penis. I like vaginas. Cool.
I meet a wonderful lady and she says she's trans. I'm progressive and liberal and therefore don't want to get put off by this despite my natural, socially normalised biases, so I go on a date with this lady. Sex could be on the cards. Do I:
a) ask if she has a dick or not? Wait no of course I can't. That's transphobic. You wouldn't ask a straight girl about her genitals!
b) wait for sex then find out, then leave if I'm uncomfortable because to expect me to have sexual contact with a penis against my wishes is very problematic. That's transphobic too though right?
c) expect her to tell me what's in her pants? No ofc not, that's transphobic because you wouldn't expect a cis girl to say ""hi my name is X and I have a vagina""
d) ask about sexual things in conversation and see if the topic comes up naturally. But that's weird, and might make the girl uncomfortable.
It's such a thorny issue and it's almost impossible not to get yourself in trouble with this and not offend. Sexuality is both a physical and a mental thing but the physical side is very important in my opinion. You can't just dismiss someone not wanting to have sexual contact with a penis as transphobic. And saying that someone might want to do other things instead of penis play is fine but you can't ask a girl you're seeing to plan out sex so that you don't have to have contact with dicks. That is also surely dehumanising to the trans girl.
Assuming that someone doesn't want to be with a trans person just because of the trans title (without thinking any further or wondering what someone might want from a relationship) is little short of virtue signalling.","#UCLove25242

Women, don't do this!
In your house its ok if you want or where no one sees them but not in a restaurant. It is a public place devoted to food consumption.
The truth is I don't agree, I don't know what you think, but it makes me sick.
I know that many will come out to defend it, and they will say a lot of things in their favor, but they won't even change my mind about this act.
It's a bad habit. You can tell what's been instilled in her house and it looks like it's normal for her, as if nothings happened, but... don’t be putting your dirty flip flops on top of the table. It isn't right.","#UCLove24773

<TRIGGER WARNING: controversial opinion, may make some uncomfortable>
.

I've been reading a lot of emotional abuse posts on this page lately. What's with the ""abusers"" being made to look like evil genius sociopaths. I'm not doubting that there may be a couple but these are young adults we're talking about. I refuse to believe that the ""abusers"" were completely at fault for the relationship. Maybe the relationship was abusive but that doesn't mean it's fair to call one of the partners an ""abuser"". I could take some statements from every relationship I've ever had (platonic or romantic) and post it on here. It's going to look super bad but hate none of my previous relationships. Even my healthy relationship with my parents may have some fucked up statements. I'm sure most of y'all will concur. Context is fucking key. What led up to the statement being said and what occurred following the statement matters a lot more than the statement itself. How can we then judge the ""abuser"" based on these statements only and sympathise with the abused?
I don't even blame the abused. They probably were dependent on the ""abuser"" and the relationship may have gone downhill due to this reason. This might have led to realizations that the relationship wasn't that healthy but that doesn't mean their partner was an evil trickster. Add to that our society's obsession with labelling things. The amount of times I've heard 'that relationship is abusive you need to get out ' despite the people knowing jack shit about the relationship itself. Yes the relationship might be abusive but does the '""abuser"" even know that. Talk to him/her. Tell them you don't like the words they use and that you expect to be treated better. If they still don't get it and the treatment doesn't change then get he fuck out of there. Even then it may not be because of the intention of the person but because of who the person truly is. Yes this is easier said then done. The abused is in love and is just trying to please the ""abuser"" so succumbs to the ""abuser's"" demands. Why is that the ""abusers"" fault? The abuser probably doesn't even know that the abused doesn't really want to do certain things since there is no communication. The ""abuser probably had past relationships where the boundaries were different and the actions weren't shunned. The ""abuser"" may think everything's going great and the person is meeting all their demands so life is perfect. The ""abuser"" does probably love the person too and isn't playing some evil game to manipulate the partners feelings. But I guess this form of withdrawal is easier to deal with when you're convinced the person was evil and was out to get you. Makes moving on easier. Its not healthier; just easier. That the person was the villain in your movie and the protagonist is just around the corner. That the person was to blame for how you've been doing in your life or will continue to do in your life. That you've now been scarred forever. Just know that a relationship can end even if both of you were lovely people; you don't have to look back in anger. It's sad that life isn't this black and white. You have to decide if the person is truly worth it and worth fighting for. But the sooner you start recognizing your flaws in the relationship and start working on them instead of thinking you were just naive in love and were exploited the better.
'Abusive' is a strong word to use. We must not instantly shower support on the apparent victim and start vilifying the apparent abuser as readers especially as we don't know the context or the story. We must not discount the extremely deleterious impact that can have on the ""abuser"" who may not even have been abusive but who is he/she to argue with the majority. Can you imagine the amount of self doubt that creates ?
I've put a TW because the likelihood of those who agree with the post of publically supporting is close to 0. It'd make so much more sense if we could like/comment on this page anonymously too. Like a UCLove reddit. People would be much more supportive and much more honest as there's no fear of being judged by friends. Deeply personal stories can be shared as a a form of therapy too.
I'm not taking any sides and I dont have the right to but i fell we as readers and public commentors of the page have a responsibility and should be as balanced and non judgmental as possible.","#UCLove24768

So trigger warning (eating disorder, self-harm, recovery)...
.
.

.
.
.
I’ve had mental health issues from like the age of 10. This manifested itself in having disordered eating patterns, and self harming.
Anyway, I’ve been so much better since university, since leaving both a toxic home and school environment.
And I thought I was doing better, I wasn’t hurting myself, wasn’t holding myself over a tall building trying to find the courage to jump, wasn’t trying to build helium bags to die as painlessly as possible.
I thought I was ‘over’ it. But on reflection, I’m not over it yet, and I don’t know whether I ever will be.
It scares the hell out of me because my mental health has gotten in the way of so many dreams and have influenced some of my biggest life decisions.
I just don’t know what to do. I got complacent in my recovery- I haven’t split my skin open in a year. A full year without breaking skin. That’s the first time in 5 years. I was proud of that fact till I realised I just replaced one unhealthy coping mechanism with another.
I don’t want my mental health to rule my life anymore but I’m terrified to get help. I did the whole ‘getting help’. My GP put me on a waiting list I never got to the top of, and prescribed anti-depressants which worked for a bit but the side effects were just too much.
Anyway I don’t know what the point of this was. Hopefully I get a grip of myself so I don’t screw things up again","#UCLove24658

Normally I would not care, but for some reason I really can't get her off of my mind. Should I text her again?

There's hope! Look into finasteride and minoxidil, you can get a perscription for both pretty easily from your GP. Finasteride works on 90+% of people, and it works really well. Although the side effects are scary, they're extremely rare and relatively overblown. Do your own research, talk to your GP, and see if its right for you. Good luck bro

Not that I haven't done it or felt that way before but it isn't right. Everyone is entitle to feel a certain way but you really don't have to do it consistently on Facebook (that goes also to the people who are mourning). At the end of the day nobody truly knew who he was. No one knew him personally. Whether he rests in peace of deserved it isn't up to any of us. People are difficult and people's life are too. Let's all just be kind to one another and respectful and stop posting shit about the dead. Let it go.

I really just want more people to read this comment from KLJ :)
Life cannot give meaning to you, you have to give meaning to your own life.
You are important because you are a human being: your feelings, your emotions, your experiences and your senses are all valid and enrich the social fabric that is our shared existence and make us all so unique and brilliant - but also terrifying - as a species. You are special because, by complete chance, you've been born into this world with the rest of us - equally created by chance - with the power to shape it in ways that we struggle to comprehend. You cannot escape having an impact on others or the world around you, and doing nothing only threatens to have more of a negative impact than if you choose to take charge and decide what it is you want to effect.
None of us asked to be where we are or to exist at all, and sometimes life throws us in directions we don't want to turn or down paths that are painful to tread, but since we've only been given this one chance we can't turn back, only move forward, and whether you choose to do that lying on your back or not, the world's going to keep on turning. Care for yourself because you have the ability to shape these things: your personality, your self-worth and the actions you take. So you're wrong: anyone born in your shoes could be in a different place, because they could make the conscious choice to do something different, as can you.
Believe me, I've asked all the same questions you're asking once before: my disability, thrust on me by chance, has led to many horrible challenges in life: I've been bullied, physically and mentally abused, tormented by my own self-loathing and struggling to fit into a society which still does not fully consider me to be a part of it, either in terms of the physical space in which we live or in the mental consciousness. This has led me at times to be a very upset and irritable person, leading to broken hearts and friendships. Many times I've wondered why I should bother to keep going or engage if all I am is such a burden, and whether the world would indeed just be a better place if I wasn't here.
Now I say, no more. I cannot change what has happened to me in the past: the things that have been done to me, what I've done to myself and to others, but I can choose who and what I want to be. I've chosen to use the life I've been given to make the world a better place, so that people - like me or not - should not have to suffer in the same ways that I have done. I want to enrich peoples lives by helping them understand their history and through that understanding themselves. This is why I will one day be Director of the British Museum, why I consciously choose to love and embrace others - faults and all - because it means I am better at loving myself, and that no matter how small, I will always choose to help rather than ignore. You can do the same, or not, but the choice is ultimately yours to make.
It's impossible to put into any kind of words how much you must possibly mean to your family, friends and loved ones. Do not try to search for those words but instead open yourself to those feelings and those emotions, and in feeling them you can begin to feel for yourself. The road will be long and hard and I cannot predict for you what might happen along the way, but I can promise you that whatever happens, it's better to be there for then to hide away and miss it all.
I hope to see you out on the road again soon, because you've got a long journey ahead of you.","#UCLove20050

Its been a while since I've posted one of my positivity posts but It's hard to stay positive sometimes.
It is sometimes easier to suffer in silence, to withdraw from the people you care about and to suffer alone whilst pretending daily that everything is ok. I have done so myself. But it doesn't help. I was never taught to display or discuss my emotions and my parents never did. I taught myself to be strong but I didn't even know what strength was. Strength isn't suffering in silence, strength is overcoming difficulties and obstacles. It's having something good to say even on a bad day. This positivity post is dedicated to everyone who feels like life isn't going their way and those that feel like each day is more difficult to go through then yesterday.
We are constantly told what type of life we should lead. We are fed the ingredients to happiness and yet we are more depressed than ever. Why do we keep pretending? Happiness isn't a fancy car or a new house, it isn't nights out or nights in. Happiness isn't truly captured in photos, snapchats or screenshots. It's about being content, reflecting on what we have, removing negativity and accepting that although we may not be happy in this moment, that no-one is constantly happy. We are taught that some people live 'the life' but remember smiling to the world is easy when you aren't being watched at night. No-one sees the tears, the fights or even the roughest nights, they just see the smiles and believe that it represents your current state of mind. Point is, no-ones life is easy and we shouldn't pretend ours is either.","#UCLove19921

For those of you students who are still having trouble with accommodation for the upcoming academic year, I have an alternative option for you. I have in a 3-bedroom house in Chelsea, close to Sloane Square tube station. In my garden, there is a shed, with a photo attached below. As you can see, it is a delightful shed, complete with two windows, a door and wooden flooring. It has the approval of shed connoisseurs such as James May and Alan Titchmarsh. I am offering you the opportunity to rent out my shed as living quarters from July 2018 to June 2019.
You will be allowed to decorate the shed as you please as long as you do not damage it and have no electrical appliances stored inside of it. In there at the moment is a sleeping bag, one pillow, some spare wood and a toolkit. You are free to use the wood and toolkit to furnish a desk and/or chair for yourself to complete your work on. Also, if you dare ruin the plants on the windows, I will hunt you down and end your pitiful existence.
You sure as hell aren't using my toilets or kitchens so you'll need to use public toilets and find your own way of feeding yourself and some other place or way to remove excrement. If you take a dump in my garden I will permanently relocate you to my basement to accommodate my legion of foreign sex slaves. I also have a decibel meter installed on my garden door; if it gets too high I will give you a warning - 3 strikes and you're out. While you are a guest, you will also be expected to wash my cars once every two months and make sure the police don't catch me and my human trafficking operation. In return, your curfew start time will be increased from 8pm to 10pm.
Prices start at £340 p/person p/week but I can be flexible.
Life in a shed is a unique and resounding experience so if you're interested, comment below and I'll send you some more information.","#UCLove19338

In reply to #UCLove18727 ,
The fact that girls are interested in you when your physique doesn’t change, but your attitude does, is the proof that you don’t need to doubt yourself and your looks so much. I’ve seen so many “average looking” guys get more girls than the typical “good looking guy”, because in the end it’s all down to how you feel about yourself, and the way you act/speak in result. Don’t think about your looks so much, because apparently it’s not the issue here, since you have no problem hitting it off with girls (suggesting that you’re not as bad looking as you might think).
Maybe try practising talking to girls without alcohol, even if sometimes you have to pretend that you are self confident. I’m a very shy person myself, and pushing myself to talk to people and “faking” self confidence at the beginning helps me being more natural after a few minutes of conversation (because people will always react well, making me feel more comfortable). And in the long run, it has truly helped me engaging with others and not feeling as scared anymore, because I understood that there is no reason to not feel confident. I know it’s hard work and you’ll need some courage at the start but honestly, try relying on alcohol less and more on yourself (you will have to at some point anyway so might as well start early). With time you will see that girls don’t react differently whether you drank or not, but only depending on your personality and theirs. Looks matter (and apparently yours are good enough to let you hit it off with girls easily), but not as much as attitude and conversation, which you can work on without alcohol.
Hope this helps x","#UCLove18747

Dear therapists of UCLove,
I need help. I can't stop thinking about this guy. He's super sweet and really handsome. He's always smiling and super friendly, and even though I'm always super nervous to talk to him (because he's also really intelligent and perceptive), he's always so kind to me.
The problem is, he's taken. He's very taken. I have no chance. But even though he's taken and it's so obvious that he'd never choose me over his significant other, I still really deeply admire him. I get butterflies in my stomach when I think of him, I get really jumpy and excited when I see him. I've practically had this crush since the beginning of term, and cannot stop stalking his social media. How do I get over him?

Pros:
My main man
Obedient ;)
Medic without superiority complex
Is friends with literally everyone while still being quiet
Cons:
Occasionally a massive snake
Warms up milk for his cereal
Long ass name
Looks weird in every single picture

Tbh Paramore were really snubbed at the Grammys and I'm still mad, After Laughter was a work of pure genius. We got one half of the Farro brothers back, but little did we know that Hayley's marriage was virtually over and that she's been dealing with major anxiety over the past 3 years after selftitled reached major pop radio highs and she's afraid she has peaked - her lyrics were raw, honest and totally heartbreaking, while the synths and beats throughout were totally bop-worthy. Every time you listen through again, you hear something new and and realise just how much betrayal and just pure shit she's had to take from men in her life for the past decade. Just the fact that so many tracks sound happy while having lyrics that are depressing as hell is so damn poetic and I relate to it so deeply. 2017 was the year of revival for old pop punk and emo bands, and Paramore definately led the way, I'm so sad they didn't receive the recognition they deserved.","#UCLove7795
