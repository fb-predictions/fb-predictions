Contact your college JCR chairs if you feel there's been a genuinely unfair application process. That's what they're there for.
It's also worth pointing out that head freps have an extremely tricky job at the moment. You also have no way if knowing how well people came across in the interviews, and how good people's applications were. It's also entirely possible that these people have contributed more to college than you know about. So I suppose don't get angry till you know the whole picture.","#Durfess19085

Any moderation on these sort of exams is pointless.
You‚Äôre punishing those that did it honestly because they abided by an honour pledge that YOU, the department, had everyone sign. And most abided by it for fear of investigation. In which case, the department should also have to abide by that pledge in marking. By which I mean, if the pledge was signed, the department should mark and moderate on that basis. Not on the basis of the final results. So, one would expect the marks to be higher. Moderating to fit very unequal circumstances to match a time of equal circumstance is idiocy beyond belief.
Only final year projects and prior marks should be taken into account for finalists and masters students. Maybe prior maximum and minimum sat exam scores from previous years or degrees as upper and lower limits at a push. Degree yearly weighting should be adjusted for 2nd/3rd years, alongside some very minor moderation of these exams rather than pointless mean and std dev manipulation to fit previous years.
Skewing marks with moderation that is based upon totally different circumstances is intellectually borderline incompetence and it tempts one to claim money back from the university. And I say that simply because the mark one obtains in an open book exam this year has been marked in a manner unknown to the student sitting it, making the exam completely worthless in terms a measure of ability.
A friend who used to study Chem at York and averaged 77 in her time there, has now got a 36% module and a myriad of low 60s% and she worked her ass off this year. But cheating and departmental incompetence has neglected her prior achievements, her work and the circumstances SIMPLY SO THEY COULD CHARGE FULL TUITION IN THIRD TERM.
Personally, I think it‚Äôs disgusting. Let employers decide if someone did well because of corona. The uni tampering to make the year appear normal makes it worse for students and one weird year on uni records because of oh idk a pandemic maybe, is pretty self explanatory and doesn‚Äôt affect the uni at all
... yes I‚Äôm angry because I am also an MSc student on the same course as her and with my prior 74% degree from Imperial, I‚Äôm suddenly sitting on 61% having taken easy open book exams I know I got at least 75-80+ in.

I recently interviewed to frep at my college and I just wanted to say how unfair I believe the process to be. Though I was successful in my application, having seen the frep group chat and everyone in it I have come to believe the process was totally skewed in some people‚Äôs favour:
1) the friends of the head freps were clearly chosen as they stick out like sore thumbs in the chat
2) the interview questions were so hard to distinguish people by I honestly think it‚Äôs mainly a show
3) the head freps had far too much say in who got onto the frep team and obviously this skewed the mix of freps (more boys since the freps are two boys)
4) people who I believe have contributed much more to college life over the last year we‚Äôre overlooked in favour of the more ‚Äòwell known‚Äô, BNOC freshers
5) lots of preference was given to incoming third years who have frepped previously which is totally unfair - let others have a chance!
Overall these are my thoughts and obviously different people think differently but I really believe that if the frep application process is so competitive that it should come down to more than the head freps/ JCR pres to choose who gets on the team - more research needs to be done and more thought needs to go into the process!!","#Durfess19061

After consideration I think one of the biggest plot holes of Harry Potter is the Remembrall. Bear with me here there's a few things to unpack.
So it sounds great on the face of it - glows red when you've forgotten something. Until you really think about it.
Is that *every* time you've forgotten something? In that case surely it would be glowing red all the time? Because surely nobody in the world can remember every single fact they have ever learnt ever. Like when it glows red for Neville it could be because he's forgotten the name of a certain frog he learnt when he was four.
Or if you did have someone who could remember EVERYTHING - they definitely can't be thinking about every single thing they've ever learnt ever all at the same time. So it could be glowing because Neville's not thinking about his grandmother's favourite type of handbag at that exact moment, or because he's not currently replaying a conversation he had with Harry 6 months ago in his head.
So what exactly does it glow for? It's perhaps implied that it glows because you've forgotten an item or something you need to do. But that's also subjective and not clear-cut. How does it decide which things you need to be thinking about right now? Does it glow because you're not currently thinking about an exam you have in 6 months? Or because you haven't yet sent your mother's birthday present even though that's a month away? This could also apply to items you've forgotten.
So overall it feels like at some point the remembrall needs to be making some judgements about what categories and/or specific things it should glow for. And that poses two problems. Firstly that it's not always glowing when you've forgotten something. But more importantly - if it is capable of assessing things like this, surely it has to know what the things are. In which case - why can't it just tell you what it is rather than this generic glowing red bollocks?
J K Rowling sort your shit out. We deserve better.","#Durfess19049

People of Durfess, I have a confession which I‚Äôd really appreciate your opinion on as ngl I‚Äôm pretty confused atm.
So I‚Äôm a guy and went on 3 dates with a girl from Tinder just before lockdown. On the third date, she said that she liked me a lot and really wanted to stay in touch but couldn‚Äôt commit to a relationship at that time. I accepted this completely and I started a few more brief conversations with her before things fizzled out. During lockdown, I see from facebook that it‚Äôs her birthday so send her a text wishing her happy birthday. She replies to this amicably and I don‚Äôt message back, but then see a few days later that she has defriended me on facebook ‚Äì presumably because she has realised that‚Äôs how I found out when her birthday was. I do nothing about this, but then message her again today 3 months later simply asking how she is doing (though, admittedly, with the faint hope that she may wish to date again). Not only does she not reply, but I find that she instantly blocks me from whatsapp, Instagram and has even blocked my profile on facebook even though we are not ‚Äòfriends‚Äô anymore.
So my question is: am I in the wrong? Or was this girl‚Äôs behaviour just way over the top? She never once told me during our messages post-3rd date that I was coming across too full-on or that she didn‚Äôt want me to message her anymore. The messages were always friendly and, as I say, she had said that she wanted to remain in touch. Please share your opinions on this. I am genuinely hurt and confused at the minute because I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôve done to be treated like this.","#Durfess19044

Ugh what is it with all this sulking on Tindur because apparently girls are only into looks? A. I'm a girl this isn't true. B. To those of you saying ""but I'm a nice guy"", has it ever occurred to you that maybe you're just not a good match? Like you can blame it on girls being shallow or say they don't appreciate your personality but if a girl doesn't have feelings for you, get over it, that's life. I'm a girl and I've never had a boyfriend, I don't look for things to blame, I just appreciate I haven't found the right person yet and I'm not shallow enough to get into a relationship with someone I don't gel with just for the status of being in a relationship.

#Durfess19027 Hi there! I changed my name last year and this is how I did it (and have had no issues since). Contact the student registry office here: student.records@durham.ac.uk. Or I called them on +44 (0)191 334 6439 (quicker) - this number directs you specifically to 'Registration, Enrolment and Student Record Enquiries' - you'll want to change your student record (your name). Explain your situation (changing name) - they are very helpful and understanding! You will need to provide evidence of your legal name change (deed poll, new passport, etc) so make sure you have a photo of it you can email to them. They contacted the IT department for me to change my email and DUO settings. I called my subject department after as well to make sure they had my new name and email recorded. You then have to contact your college, to tell them about your new name and email. Also tell people who will be emailing you often (tutors, etc). I hope this helps! Congrats on changing your name x","#Durfess19033

Remember - the law recently changed. It is a criminal offence for your Landlord or Letting Agents to charge you ANY fees of any kind - even if you signed it in your Tenancy Agreement - unless you've caused actual damage. For example, it would be illegal for them to charge you a ""standard carpet cleaning fee"", even if you signed for this, if you left the carpet in a good state. See page 31 of Tenant Fees Act 2019: Guidance for tenants. If you've already paid these fees, by law you are entitled to a full refund within 28 days. Landlords and Estate Agents will try to get away with this, knowing the majority of students won't bother to research the law. Just Google ""Tenant Fees Act 2019: Guidance for tenants"" and have a quick read of the government pdf document. If you've been charged for any wear and tear, chances are this is illegal.","#Durfess19031

Bit confused whether all those who have gone to live up in Durham for the last few weeks of term read the university's recently released email which said that people who chose their home addresses (or an address outside of Durham) as their address to lockdown in and have since returned to their term time address in Durham are breaking the rules about moving to a second home. This message was passed on from Durham police who have said it is in breach of the lockdown rules. The rules state that you may only move addresses for exceptional circumstances like work, domestic abuse or child care issues: I don't think 'celebrating the end of the year at uni' would come under one of those exceptional circumstances. I understand we are all gutted that we can't be in Durham at arguably the best point in the year, and as a finalist I am extra upset this can't happen. However, it's so upsetting to see students blatantly ignoring this so they can have some fun with their friends and are willing to put the local population at risk to do so. I've heard numerous people justifying their actions saying 'it's their home', 'it's their new permanent household' etc., but the rules state otherwise. Just admit it, you're breaking them, and being downright selfish in doing so.","#Durfess18996

British food is better when you're brought up on it - good, home-cooked, British dishes made from fresh ingredients for flavour (which is why we don't need to rely on spices). Also, we may not use a lot of spices, but herbs are key. So for everyone who thinks ""there is no British cuisine"" just because you haven't taken the time to actually EXPERIENCE British cuisine: I am here to educate you with the highlights that I know of. If you look it up there‚Äôll be much more.
The Pies:
- shepherd‚Äôs pie
- cottage pie
- fish pie
- steak and kidney pie
- game pie
- pork pie
- corned beef and potato (and onion) pie
- leek and potato pie
- more but I cba to list them all so these are the highlights
Scottish foods:
- scotch eggs
- haggis neeps and tatties (btw even tho haggis is the Scottish national dish technically it originated in England sorry Scots lol)
- full Scottish breakfast
- cullen skink
- smoked haddock
- chicken tikka masala (yes really apparently it's Glaswegian)
Northern English foods:
- chicken parmos
- saveloy dip (aka Dickson's saveloy)
- panackelty/pan haggerty
- ham and pease pudding stottie
- scouse (not the true north but let's humour them)
- tripe
General English foods:
- ale/beer stew
- liver and onion
- bangers and mash (plenty of onions in the gravy)
- mince and dumplings (also known as cobbler)
- toad in the hole
- hotpot
- cornish pasty
- beef Wellington
- ploughman‚Äôs lunch
- bubble and squeak
- BLT
- prawn cocktail
Welsh food:
- Laverbread
- Welsh rarebit
- sorry idk much else about Welsh food
Classics which everyone knows but I need to include them:
- Sunday dinner (with black pepper, mint sauce/ mustard/horseradish/applesauce)
- fry up (sunday dinner leftovers)
- full English breakfast (heart attack on a plate lol)
- fish and chips (haddock or cod, with batter/scraps, mushy peas, and plenty of vinegar)
- beans on toast (sorry I had to)
- crumpets (drenched in butter)
- sausage roll
- jacket potato
- cheese on toast
- jellied eels I guess
*majority of these are served with masses of vegetables
*special shoutout to the good old Irish stew but I think that‚Äôs from Republic of Ireland not Northern Ireland
*British desserts are a WHOLE OTHER post. I'll consider making it if this gets posted/enough enthusiasm.
If you cook/manage to get a good quality, rich meal then British food is great. If you still don‚Äôt think much of it, that‚Äôs fine, but just because you‚Äôve probably lived off Paddy‚Äôs, Dominos, and ready-made meals since you‚Äôve lived here it doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have a cuisine.","#Durfess18968

-Low quality internet connections in poorer income areas and affordable 2nd rate internet packages. You probably never even had to consider that was a thing.
- screaming kids all day in the neighbourhood throughout quarantine, and even a students own younger household members.
-antisocial neighbourhoods causing disruption.
-Not having your own room, or even a basic work space with a desk.
-the expectation to oversee the household and younger family members all day while parents work over time as key workers (for awful pay that can't even cover all of the above).
- a family environment affected by everyday issues such as alcoholism, long term illness, or overall poor mental health.
And these aren't even unusual. Durham Students WILL be affected by some of these factors.

Imagine you're taking six modules that are all assessed by a three-hour exam at the end of the year. That's eighteen hours of exams that you've put in over three weeks.
Now, imagine you're a module leader of a module that has 100 students. That one exam that each of your students put 3 hours into has become 300 hours of material for you to grade. If you put as much time into marking the exam as your students put into writing it, it would take you *eight weeks* of full-time work to mark the exams. But guess what! Your workload model (if you have one at all) allocates you about 30 minutes per script ‚Äì what your students wrote you should be able to read, assess, and comment on in 1/6th of the time. So, really, you're only expected to put in 50 hours marking that one exam ‚Äì about a week and a half of full-time work.
Except, marking that one exam isn't the only thing you're doing. You've got another exam, with a similar workload, to mark, and you've also got nine or ten 12,000 word dissertations to mark in the same period. (Not to mention the dissertation proposals MA students are submitting, which need feedback and marks, or the chapters your PhD students are sending you because they still hope to finish up this academic year.) On top of this, you're having weekly departmental meetings to keep on top of the changing situation; these meetings take 2-3 hours. You've also got team meetings for people who will face special challenges if teaching is done remotely in fall ‚Äì people who teach languages, or need whiteboards to write equations, or do hands-on stuff like music or labs, and even when you're not in a meeting you're constantly running through the back of your mind all the different ways you can/must restructure your classes if you aren't able to present your content to your students in person in all. Then there's also the EDI meetings that you attend as part of one of your admin roles. On top of all of this, the university management are developing plans for radical restructuring of the university without any consultation of the people who would have to implement the plans or the people who would be on the receiving end of the implementation ‚Äì given your position in the union, you are part of weekly meetings (sometimes multiple weekly meetings) to try to prevent or mitigate these potential disasters. You need to have emergency general meetings with the full union membership every other week, it feels like. And then there are the emails, the constant emails ‚Äì sometimes upwards of 60 or 70 a day.
Don't forget about all the research deadlines that are whizzing by ‚Äì deadlines to submit papers to conferences or to special issues of journals, deadlines for grants and other types of funding, deadlines to revise and resubmit papers you managed to squeeze out despite the strikes in spring. Some of these deadlines there is flexibility and forgiveness for, but for most of them, if you miss them, they're gone. You won't get that paper out this year, or that other paper out, either. Which means the next time promotions come around (_if_ they come around, given the current financial crises facing universities) you're going to get passed over again, because you know what? None of the effort you have invested into teaching, rewriting exams, advising, getting your marking done on time, attending all the planning meetings, redeveloping your modules for next year counts as much as that paper you didn't get published.
But wait, there's more! Because your children are home, you get to do all of this while simultaneously making sure that they are logged on when and where they need to be logged on for synchronous teaching, making sure they have all the materials they need for asynchronous learning, sitting next to them making sure they do their asynchronous learning, swapping technology around to make sure everyone has the kit they need when they need it (everyone in the house is swapping around headsets because not every headset works with every computer/programme in the house, even though you bought a new headset a few weeks into lockdown. Oh, and that headset? Don't forget you had to pay for it yourself, despite the fact that you couldn't really do all those meetings without it.

That's it.), and because your house is small and you and your partner are both attempting to work fulltime at home and your children have excess energy you try to get out once a day at least an hour just for the kids to run around. No matter how tough you're finding this yourself, you need to do everything you can to ensure that they aren't struggling. That means not only helping them through their remote schooling, but getting up when they do even when all you want to do is sleep, chatting with them about their work, being willing to be interrupted every time they need to know how to spell a word, even if it makes your marking twice as long as it would if they didn't, spending time with them in the evening, doing your best not to huddle on the couch (remember, you don't have a desk at home ‚Äì or rather, you do, but your children are using it for their schooling, so you just get to sit on the couch, or your bed) with your headphones on snapping ""I'm busy working!"" when you get interrupted for the millionth time, making sure they get regular, balanced meals ‚Äì oh, and about that, since you've got way more people eating at home than you're used to, you're constantly needing to shop. You haven't been able to get an online delivery slot in three months. You don't have a car, so that limits how much you can carry home at a time, which means you're going out in the morning (it's quickest then) every 4-5 days, and there goes another hour of your day.
You'd work in the evening after your children are in bed, but by the time that happens, you are just so damn exhausted, your brain doesn't work anymore. You've been exhausted for years now ‚Äì a year and a half ago, it got so bad, you went to the dr to see if there was something physically wrong or if it was just your workload slowly killing you. It didn't help when the dr. listened to the litany of your life with a looking of horror dawning on his face and then said ""I'm exhausted just listening to you"".
But you're one of the lucky ones. You and your partner _can_ work from home, and your children are getting excellent support from their school. None of you have gotten sick. None of your family (who all live in another country ‚Äì don't forget that as an academic you're more likely to be an immigrant) have gotten sick. All your friends and colleagues who've gotten sick have recovered. For now.","#Durfess18959
Imagine you're taking six modules that are all assessed by a three-hour exam at the end of the year. That's eighteen hours of exams that you've put in over three weeks.
Now, imagine you're a module leader of a module that has 100 students. That one exam that each of your students put 3 hours into has become 300 hours of material for you to grade. If you put as much time into marking the exam as your students put into writing it, it would take you *eight weeks* of full-time work to mark the exams. But guess what! Your workload model (if you have one at all) allocates you about 30 minutes per script ‚Äì what your students wrote you should be able to read, assess, and comment on in 1/6th of the time. So, really, you're only expected to put in 50 hours marking that one exam ‚Äì about a week and a half of full-time work.
Except, marking that one exam isn't the only thing you're doing. You've got another exam, with a similar workload, to mark, and you've also got nine or ten 12,000 word dissertations to mark in the same period. (Not to mention the dissertation proposals MA students are submitting, which need feedback and marks, or the chapters your PhD students are sending you because they still hope to finish up this academic year.) On top of this, you're having weekly departmental meetings to keep on top of the changing situation; these meetings take 2-3 hours. You've also got team meetings for people who will face special challenges if teaching is done remotely in fall ‚Äì people who teach languages, or need whiteboards to write equations, or do hands-on stuff like music or labs, and even when you're not in a meeting you're constantly running through the back of your mind all the different ways you can/must restructure your classes if you aren't able to present your content to your students in person in all. Then there's also the EDI meetings that you attend as part of one of your admin roles. On top of all of this, the university management are developing plans for radical restructuring of the university without any consultation of the people who would have to implement the plans or the people who would be on the receiving end of the implementation ‚Äì given your position in the union, you are part of weekly meetings (sometimes multiple weekly meetings) to try to prevent or mitigate these potential disasters. You need to have emergency general meetings with the full union membership every other week, it feels like. And then there are the emails, the constant emails ‚Äì sometimes upwards of 60 or 70 a day.
Don't forget about all the research deadlines that are whizzing by ‚Äì deadlines to submit papers to conferences or to special issues of journals, deadlines for grants and other types of funding, deadlines to revise and resubmit papers you managed to squeeze out despite the strikes in spring. Some of these deadlines there is flexibility and forgiveness for, but for most of them, if you miss them, they're gone. You won't get that paper out this year, or that other paper out, either. Which means the next time promotions come around (_if_ they come around, given the current financial crises facing universities) you're going to get passed over again, because you know what? None of the effort you have invested into teaching, rewriting exams, advising, getting your marking done on time, attending all the planning meetings, redeveloping your modules for next year counts as much as that paper you didn't get published.
But wait, there's more! Because your children are home, you get to do all of this while simultaneously making sure that they are logged on when and where they need to be logged on for synchronous teaching, making sure they have all the materials they need for asynchronous learning, sitting next to them making sure they do their asynchronous learning, swapping technology around to make sure everyone has the kit they need when they need it (everyone in the house is swapping around headsets because not every headset works with every computer/programme in the house, even though you bought a new headset a few weeks into lockdown. Oh, and that headset? Don't forget you had to pay for it yourself, despite the fact that you couldn't really do all those meetings without it. The university is only providing monitors, keyboards, mice, and office chairs to people working from home. That's it.), and because your house is small and you and your partner are both attempting to work fulltime at home and your children have excess energy you try to get out once a day at least an hour just for the kids to run around. No matter how tough you're finding this yourself, you need to do everything you can to ensure that they aren't struggling.

I have no problem with them taking longer to mark the exams but the argument that we were given 48 hours to make exams better for us doesnt work for subjects like maths where someone can Google the answer, get high Mark's and fuck everyone else over. Lots of people in stem are more stressed about how they can moderate our work fairly then we were doing the actual exams. Also they didnt give us extra time to revise and as far as I know havent moved the resit deadline so the delays are only going one way there which will impact some people hard and cause alot of extra stress.
My issue isnt with the staff getting more time it's with the fact we had to do exams they knew for certain they cant mark fairly (atleast in alot of stem because how the fuck can you) which had questions we had seen before on them (every paper had atleast a couple of questions in the notes or on the work sheets so we had seen and had access to the answer already) and others which people could just Google and as it's a right or wrong answer its alot harder to work out who cheated and who didn't which screws anyone who didnt cheat. It means me working hard all year and revising loads was a waste of my fucking time and they knew it would be from the start. The uni higher ups wanted our money with no regard for our mental health or well being as is too often the case. Shame on the high ups at the uni. Dont hate on the markers. They arent the ones screwing you over.","#Durfess18930

Some reasons I've seen about why exam marking is taking so long, and why I can totally accept them as reasons for delay, but not as delayed as it is when some people's future jobs/lives rely on having a degree classification by the end of June/leaving non-finalists in too much of an uncertain position wrt resits.
""Exam answers are longer because of the 48hr exam period so marking takes longer"". Exams were still only meant to take the usual time, and anyone who took longer than that was being selfish, putting their own interest above what's fair and honourable, if there's any answers that are longer than what you'd normally expect based on a normal exam and the student's past performance should be flagged up immediately for a viva voce, which yes will add to the marking period length, but not enough to delay it that severely.
""Lecturers are having to restructure their courses to fit an online medium for next year"". Does that actually take that long? Lectures can still be given in the exact same way, tutorials and seminars can be done via conferencing, homeworks/assignments can still be set in the exact same way, with online submissions an online marks/feedback, the only people I can see being actually seriously affected by this are people who do fieldwork or labs. Definitely not enough for a massive delay.
""Markers will be under stresses and other circumstances that will slow them down with their ability to mark"". So I wasn't under stress and circumstance when I was doing the exams, and still sticking to the 3hour timings? I was totally given extensions and allowances for assignments and exams? That's funny, I don't remember that, what I do remember is getting pretty much to my breaking point trying to keep up with everything, but also being told that that isn't grounds for an additional SAC form because it's already covered under the blanket SAC for COVID. Also, isn't marking exams part of the job for members of staff? Surely ""doing your job"" is a good enough motivation, it's more than any of us got to sit the exams with.
""It's more than just reading answers and giving a mark, there's feedback for all of those exams that needs doing too"". And this is different from any other year because? Also, I've been on the receiving end of some of that ""feedback"", a few words in a comment box doesn't take long to write, it's barely feedback to begin with so unless the university has implemented a (long overdue) minimum word count for feedback I don't buy this at all.
I'm not saying that exam markers won't have other commitments or that they'll have an easy time, but the length of the delay is extremely unfair when we weren't given extensions and were expected to treat it like normal exams (I'd like to think most students did that, but by the looks of comments on various Durfesses and what I've overheard people saying when in public that doesn't sound to be the case...) and there's a very large proportion of the student population explicitly relying on marks before the end of June for all sorts of reasons, visas, jobs, postgrad positions, funding submission deadlines, etc that aren't going to bow down to ""my university has delayed everything to treat paid staff better than paying students""","#Durfess18926

I give you a toast, ladies and gentlemen.
May this fair dear land we love so well
In dignity and booze dwell.
Though worlds may change and go awry
While there is still one voice to cry
There'll always be a Pimm‚Äôs-land
While there's a Waitrose Aisle,
Wherever there's a tennis match
Playing on the BBC.
There'll always be a Pimm‚Äôs-land
While there's a summers day,
Wherever there's a cricket match,
A million marching feet.
Red, white and gold; what does it mean to you?
Surely, you're proud, shout it aloud,
""Wimbledon!""
Glyndebourne too, we can depend on you.
Booze remains. These are the chains
Nothing can break.
There'll always be a Pimm‚Äôs-land,
And Pimm‚Äôs-land shall be boozy
If Pimm‚Äôs-land means as much to you

The Welfare Teams- condoms, 'how do you feel' every day, tea videos and having a cup of tea everywhere we go? I left a College Welfare Team because I'm graduating so I want to give you all a bit of insight into who's behind the drop-ins. We're normal students and you can have a conversation with us about absolutely anything and everything. In my dropins, I've had conversations about all sorts. I signed up to the team because I had enough of people being talked down to when they say they have a mental health problem such as depression or anxiety, or just going through an impersonal system dehumanising them. I wanted to treat people with a human level of respect and as a peer, not making myself seem better than anyone. I'm certainly not your stereotypical Welfare person! The people I worked with are some of the most wonderful people that you'll ever meet, and they have a sense of humour!
Now, the welfare job is sometimes intense and affects you personally, I don't think that I would be right for the job if I didn't care about what people are going through. This is why I signed up for welfare, not to get involved with the power struggles and cliques of student politics. That's something that really annoys me, I just want to be a human and respect people, I care about my peers, not the big institutions. The welfare team members I've worked with are dedicated and they're not doing this to go up in the Durham politics food chain, they're doing it to help their peers. I know of people who've been seriously affected and have made huge sacrifices to do this work.
It's been the biggest honour of my 4 years in Durham to have people trust me when they come to the welfare room crying or they break down in a vulnerable state and they come back after being signposted to support having felt that they were respected and are in a much better state. If I wasn't graduating, then I would sign up to do it all again. I honestly thought that Welfare was the last thing I would be involved with!
Say hi to your welfare team, they don't just want to hear from you when there's a problem. Many welfare teams now have virtual drop ins and there doesn't have to be anything wrong to phone up. I was always happy to hear from people in my drop-ins, I've made many cups of tea and discussed trivia. There was no typical drop in, we get anything and everything. We don't go to your pals and spread gossip. We're students too, typically experienced and have gone through most of Durham's tribulations.","#Durfess18870

Durham Colleges if they were songs by The 1975
Hatfield - M.O.N.E.Y. I‚Äôll leave you to figure this one out.
Hild Bede - People. Separate from the rest, this track as heavy as Bring me the Horizon gets proper engergetic. PeOpLe LiKe PeOpLe could easily be replaced with cries of YEEEAHHH HILD BEEEEDE.
Stevo - The End (Music For Cars). It‚Äôs a drive away.
Van Mildert - Sex. All the fit girls already with boyfriends go to Mildert.
Castle - This Must Be My Dream. What even is the ratio of people who applied to Castle vs people who went on to get it assigned it as their college?
John Snow - Woman. I‚Äôve never met anyone from John Snow, nor have I ever listened to this song.
Collingwood - Settle Down. We get it, you go to self-proclaimed ‚Äòking of the hill colleges‚Äô. For crying out loud, I don‚Äôt need you to remind me every other sentence.
St John‚Äôs - Jesus Christ 2005 Good Bless America. Isn‚Äôt this one obvious?
Grey - Chocolate. Alright Grey don‚Äôt get proud all of a sudden because the most well-known song is given to you. This song is mumbled, generic and not actually very indicative of the rest of their repertoire; actually it‚Äôs rather boring.
Cuths - The Sound. Cuths bar has the best atmosphere, don‚Äôt @ me. It is only fitting that the best song live goes here (1 2 f***ing jump!).
Mary‚Äôs - Milk. It‚Äôs alliterative.
JoBo - UGH! Wait, how far is the walk there again?
Ustinov - The City. A really old song. Non-fans might recognise this tune from the FIFA 14 soundtrack.
Trevs - The 1975 (NOACF version). Greta Thunberg‚Äôs speech fits well here considering the space-efficient, pollution-conscious hexagons.
Chad‚Äôs - Guys. This is the best college bar space to sit down and have some pints with the boys.
Aidan‚Äôs - Somebody Else. *college allocation email arrives*...applicant:‚Äùwhat is an Aidan‚Äù
South (congrats you‚Äôre on a list)- Depth. Incomplete college just like this unreleased song that they played during their Reading headline set, implying it was in the new album, only for it to not appear on the track list and has not been heard from since.

A real confession here: this year has made me totally ashamed to be a member of castle. We were given a principal who actually cared about the welfare of students and the entirety of the jcr took to mocking him on Facebook groups and did all they could to get rid of him. Drinking culture is an issue in Durham, its an issue everywhere - people drinking till they puke or can't walk is not healthy for the individual, and for people who don't drink and arnt used to seeing people in that state it can be a really disturbing experience. The first term of this year was the first instance in my 3 years at Durham of feeling safe when going to college events but the student body, who always claim to put welfare first, would rather be able to drink until they blackout than do anything about it.
At the end of the day what you put in your body is your own choice but belittling someone who was genuinely trying to help is just ridiculous! If you want to do that to yourself then go ahead but you shouldn't expect the college to idly let that happen. Drinking culture across Durham is an issue that i wish more people would display some concern for as its a real issue.","#Durfess18661

It is your responsibility to ensure that the examination paper in front of you is the paper you are expecting to take. If this is not the case please raise your hand. You are also responsible for ensuring that your bag and coat are at the front of the venue. If you have a mobile phone it must be turned off and placed inside your bag. If you do not have a bag, the phone must be placed underneath your chair face down. No phones should be on your person.
The only items permitted on an examination desk, in addition to those specified in the rubric, are personal stationery, a watch, a clear pencil case, a small clear bottle of water and one item of food, which can be consumed without distracting others. If you are wearing a watch of any kind (analogue, digital or smart) or a fitness tracker you must remove it and place it in full view on your desk. No other electronic items are allowed on your desk and the wearing of headphones, even if not connected to a device, is not permitted. It is against University regulations to bring unauthorised materials (including revision notes) into the examination room, whether you intend to use them or not. Please check now, before the exam begins, if you have any material that you should not have with you. If you find any material, raise your hand and give it to an invigilator. No further action will be taken if you do this now. If you discover material after the examination has started, raise your hand immediately and give the material to an invigilator. Incidents of a student being found in possession of such material will be reported and disciplinary action will be taken.
Please ensure that you complete your attendance card before the examination begins, and place your campus card on the corner of your desk.
Once the examination has started you will not be allowed to leave the room for the first 30 minutes.
If you wish to leave the room before the end of the examination, please raise your hand and an invigilator will attend to you.
If you have any questions or issues during the examination please raise your hand and an invigilator will assist you.
You must read the front page of the examination paper carefully as it contains important information about which questions to answer and where to write your answers.
An invigilator will inform you when you have 15 minutes remaining in your examination. Once this has been announced you will not be able to leave the room until the end of the examination.","#Durfess18588

Glad you brought up this issue about Strava. Even though what you said was pretty amusing, I'm sure that there are people (including myself!) that legitimately didnt know that people can and do cheat and ultimately might have felt embarrassed using the app for fear of being shamed for their results. It's so important to remind people that they shouldn't feel bad if they aren't running 5k in under 20 mins (which is an incredible achievement!), heck, we are under enough pressure right now to perform as it is! We've already got to contend with 'productivity porn' , we dont need yet another thing making us feel bad when we don't live up to what we think others are acheiving. I find it bizarre and saddening that some people have managed to make something as positive as being active and reaching your own PB into yet another thing people feel as though they need to worry about. The very fact you brought attention to people auditing their 'strava presence' in a social media-esque way brings attention to the pressure we put ourselves under. Maybe we should all be a bit more honest, less competitive and just do what keeps us happy and healthy right now. Just enjoy your exercise and dont compare your own PBs to others, which I think goes for most things in life! Yours sincerely, a bitter, unfit finalist that can barely manage 200ms.","#Durfess18548

Grow a pair and queue for an hour, or just arrive at opening and get bevved while waiting for the dancefloor to fill. Lloyds and Klute do it right. I remember when Durhameme had a club knockout competition and those two titans were in the final.
Current freshers and second years, where did you go wrong? You've ruined years of tradition for shitty clubs that actually try and be serious (Players-bleurgh) instead of embracing Klute and Lloyds in all their ironically terrible glory. Shame on you.

This is a very shortsighted view. Whilst the university clearly will benefit in terms of expenditure, there are other issues at play here. Reducing the number of workers necessary to keep the student population in Durham supported by consolidating the colleges will mean less disruption when increasing numbers of staff are self isolating or off ill. It will also reduce the number of staff who need to come into work, thus reducing the contact and spread of the virus. Furthermore if the government needed to requisition emergency coronavirus accommodation, as has happened in other countries, the empty other colleges could be used.
Please consider the whole situation. I'm not saying Durham University is perfect by any stretch, but there are reasons why their decision is sensible.","#Durfess18203

I‚Äôm actually so upset with the way college have handled the consolidation process. Forcibly entering students‚Äô rooms to put their possessions into bin liners if you can‚Äôt collect in 5 days isn‚Äôt fair and certainly not within my contract? I understand the tricky situation but shouldn‚Äôt the system be opt-in? With no word about compensation for current students, I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm paying to have somebody else stay in my room, use my kitchen utensils, help themselves to my food and I haven‚Äôt even consented to it?? My college haven‚Äôt even given me an opportunity to opt-out of this. I can‚Äôt afford petrol or a train ticket to come up and retrieve my possessions, and I‚Äôm worried they might damage my possessions that I left behind. I asked whether I could move back and self-isolate / social distance in Durham for the next few months in order to prevent this, but was then told that I was not allowed?? How is this legal? Please advice Durfess üò¢

We're 3 weeks into the Easter holidays and our Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, releases a statement that Covid-19 has been dealt with successfully and life, for the most part, can go back to normal
Within a couple of days, we all receive an email from the university's central office, notifying us that Easter term is now confirmed to occur. All the stress of not seeing your most beloved mates for 7 months evaporates and you prepare to return
You reenter Durham a couple of weeks later and embrace your flatmates on arrival. Klute? Silly question, you've been stockpiling free shot cards since before the virus was even a threat. The first night out is immense and you feel at home again.
Exam season is stressful but you and your mates get through it together. Now onto summer sessions. The beer is flowing, joy is abundant, you don't have a care in the world.
Summer ball is the highlight and the round off to a wonderful year. You say goodbye to all your mates before you leave for summer, knowing you'll see them all again soon...

I'm going to have to disagree with your second part there. I'm autistic and I joke about it with my mates. I dont see why it should be something that everyone should walk on egg shells about. Like if someone is actively a dick about it then yeah fair enough be angry but I use autistic as a joke fully aware that I'm autistic and that it's not the same as what most people think it is.
Some people with learning difficulties or mental health issues or anything like that will hate anyone joking about it and that's fine but it annoys me more when people act like we all are. I'm about that hardest person to insult and I dont like that someone thinks they can tell me that I have to be upset that someone else used autism as an insult since I really do not care in the slightest.
This isnt aimed at you specifically as this is something I've seen like 8 times since getting to uni and it annoys me every time.
Why get offended on my behalf. Also special shout out to the people who get offended on my behalf about me using autistic as an insult because that's some next level pandering.","#Durfess17900

I get that the queues are frustrating but that's not necessarily straight people's fault. Even without straight people the queues would be huge. Surely this is just proof that durham LGBT+ demand is higher than supply. Perhaps each club should run a gay night on different days of the week?
Furthermore, LGBT+ is about inclusivity and by excluding cis straight people, it would contradict the whole idea of being inclusive. If we want the world to accept us we should be inviting allies in and not pushing them away. Also what about straight friends who want to support their LGBT+ friends. Or straight people who just want to reassure xplore their sexuality in a safe environment.

How are so many people absolutely fine with other students casually going to the races? Using animals for entertainment is disgusting, and the horse racing industry is one of the worst culprits. Not only is the sport cruel in itself, but the industry is also rife with drug abuse, injuries and race-fixing. With many horses being killed and ending up at slaughterhouses at the end of their careers as if they are disposable objects.
I appreciate that many people will have differing views to myself and will agree to different extents. However, if you think horse racing is wrong then like this post and inform anyone who goes to the races or is thinking of going, of the unjust cruelty in the sport. After that, unfortunately, it is their choice if they still choose to go.","#Durfess17793

These strike tactics are literally ridiculous. A bunch of lecturers disappear for a few weeks, meaning students have to pick up the slack and work much harder to make up for it. And whilst all this is going on, the university actually saves money by not paying the strikers?!
I may be misunderstanding this, but just isn't going to work. They've tried this many times over the last 3 years, and SURPISE it hasn't worked.

Tbh the CU has always been this way. Unless you‚Äôre part of their echo chamber, of mainly white, mainly middle class, mainly raised as conservative Christians, then they seem out of touch and insensitive. (They are but) What people don‚Äôt realise is to them their behaviour and beliefs are normal and okay and ‚Äòloving‚Äô and actually the rest of us are wrong.

Tbh the CU has always been this way. Unless you‚Äôre part of their echo chamber, of mainly white, mainly middle class, mainly raised as conservative Christians, then they seem out of touch and insensitive. (They are but) What people don‚Äôt realise is to them their behaviour and beliefs are normal and okay and ‚Äòloving‚Äô and actually the rest of us are wrong.

As someone who has way too much experience on this front due to watching a toxic and abusive parent I want to suggest caution.
Something definately needs to be done as the behaviour is unacceptable. That being said, the abuser will likely not ever change their behaviour (at least bot for long) and your freind will likely resist calls for them to split up. People in toxic relationships become codependent very quickly. Dont cut your freind off. Abusers very commonly try and separate them from their freinds as it makes control much easier so this would make the situation alot worse.
You need to be direct and offer support but just be careful not to push to hard and fast thay you end up losing them as things will likely get worse with you out of the picture.
Also to the victim who likely doesnt think it's a problem or anyone else in a relationship similar to this (or different but toxic) know this, while they may claim they dont mean to hurt you and will likely cry and beg and promise to change do not belive them for a second no matter how much you want to.

I need thoughts on something that happened after a date last night.
We've been dating for four months now. We went on a date for the first time in a while (exams and his work got super busy) and it all went so well, just like every date we've been on. We went back to mine and had sex - again this was really good and passionate. He had to go after due to working early the next morning, but we cuddled for a bit.
Then he said ""I just need some time, I've been having a tough patch recently. It's partly career but partly relationship stuff. I still want to see you, you've done nothing to make me want to leave you, but I need some time away from this"".
What is this about? Everything seemed so good and now I'm super confused. I want to help him, but I'm also struggling mentally right now and I don't know what to do. Do I text him a few times and try to offer my help? Do I just go silent and give him space properly?

Hi,
We are a group of students who love good quality toilets and we are mapping & rating toilets across the university.
If you want to help us with our mission, join our league on the app ‚ÄòPoop Map‚Äô (download for free on the App Store).
The league is called DUPS (Durham University Pooing Society), and in order to join, simply enter the code ‚Äòkocduxrio1502‚Äô.
We rate & map our poos and sometimes even comment on other people‚Äôs poos, and soon you can too!
(Ps. Make sure you turn on ‚Äòshare poops with joined leagues‚Äô in settings so we can see where you‚Äôve dropped one!)","#Durfess17344

Looks like the strikes are coming back in a big way. Nothing so far to suggest the uni won‚Äôt handle them as awfully as last time. As students we need to get organised. If we show our anger and put pressure on the uni maybe they‚Äôll take UCU seriously and sort it all out. Individual efforts just don‚Äôt work.
I‚Äôm up for putting together a group of organisers from each subject/year group so we can get the ball rolling. If/when the new round of strikes happens it would be awesome if students came together with a response.
LIKE/HEART this post if you‚Äôre up for showing the uni how much strikes matter to students.
COMMENT with your course and year if you are interested in getting involved organising and I‚Äôll add you to a fb group (ideally 2 from each subject/year group).

I am fed up of the attitude that the chemistry department have towards its students. We work hard throughout the year to meet weekly lab report deadlines and writing lit perspectives with very limited advice on how to do so, as well as trying to keep up with all the content heavy lectures and reviewing these lectures before the workshops.
So missing one 9am is for us to decide, because maybe it‚Äôs easier to catch up on that lecture after completing our long 10-6 day and get that extra hour of sleep. If you want higher attendance in lectures, don‚Äôt schedule two 9am-6pm days back to back.
And, do not make the students who actually did turn up at 9am on a wet, grey morning listen to a rant about their hard-working and probably very stressed peers.

You're clearly a computer scientist, a physicist actually understands what to do with data. They'd produce graphs like these and explain where you went wrong:
- Excel! C'mon man, no one who can call themselves a scientist uses excel for their graphs.
- You have posted JUST the data, this is meaningless without anything to compare it to!
- You have failed to interpret or explain any of the key features of your data, for example: there is a false positive in the increase in the number of seats as people bail out of the library for lunch, the counter is reset back to 1800 every night, most importantly the library appears to be misrepresenting the number of available seats in the billy b, it seems strange that the number of seats hasn't fallen below 200 during the course of one of the busiest weeks of the library.
If you're going to science, do it properly. Then you can come play in the big league.

Both men and women are sexually objectified and idealised. I welcome the day everyone can find power in sex and not get so caught up on what is offensive to the few who can‚Äôt see the beauty in their own sex and desires
Men are portrayed as chiselled and muscled, whether they‚Äôre dominant as in the advertisement, or submissive in being lead around by their tie by a woman (for example). Women are toned and athletic (which I am definitely not haha), again whether submissive or dominant in the advertisement. Celebrate and enjoy sex and it‚Äôs themes. Don‚Äôt strip it out of society. Go in a museum and you‚Äôll see the interplay of dominance and submission between the sexes. It‚Äôs nature and if you find that offensive... well... maybe that‚Äôs indicative of an issue within oneself, rather than society","#Durfess8334

Durham Colleges as Hamilton characters
Collingwood- Alexander Hamilton. Bastards, orphans, sons of whores and Scotsmen trying to carve a name for themselves with the rich, white elites but ultimately end up showing them up. Loved in spite of their flaws
Grey- John Laurens. Kind of boring and irrelevant but nice enough.
Hatfield- King George. Posh, unpleasant, incestuous. You're rooting for them to fail and yet somehow they're still fuckable.
Castle- George Washington. BNOC, everyone wants to be there, ""it must be nice"". Not quite the twats you'd think they are.
Johns - Thomas Jefferson. Known for their beliefs and ideals and yet hide the most intensely loud and flamboyant gay streak to them. Somehow they'll end up between your legs
John Snow and Stephenson- John Adams. Not really in the play/Durham and nobody gives a shit about them
Butler- Theodosia. Unseen and yet somehow their presence is felt.
Mary's- Maria Reynolds. Cute, plain. Look energy. You'll end up fucking one and regretting afterwords
Aidans- Hercules Mulligan. Has their moment but is usually forgotten about until mentioned
Mildert- James Madison. seemingly quiet and humble but hides a big personality.
Chads- Angelica Schuyler. Independent, takes no shit from anyone, but loveable and always there when you need them. Pretty big deal and everyone wants in.
Cuths- Aaron Burr. Extremely endearing and will end up stealing the show even if they do have a bit of a shitty side(Parsons)
HB- Eliza Hamilton. Generally out of the way but never forgettable. Meek and pleasant but will burn it all if you cross them. Pretty solid aesthetic.
Trevs- Charles Lee. Arrogant and yet fuck up time and time again. Needs to shut up and sit down
Ustinov- George Eacker. Sick of everyone's shit and will put a bullet in you if you disturb them from their work","#Durfess8228

Excuse me. How dare you. (From a map sucking geography student). I am outraged at the degreeism that occurs here. Geography? Not a good degree? Kiss my ass. Geography is the best degree like ever. Maths is for unsociable cucks who want to learn about stuff that people already know and this is pointless. However, physics and all the sciences are no bleeding different. As for historian... no one cares. Psychology and sociology should be our real concern they literally aren't degrees. And as for classics, well they are as bad as the classic planet of the apes. I've had it up to here (the height of globe number 3 in my room that i keep above my cupboard). The discrimination is unfounded and purely the narrative of structuralist views. Now I'm no communist but I'm pretty sure the activity of slandering our subject is not natural (Baldwin, 2018). Thus, never shall you ever destroy my subject again. If it wasn't for us all you silly fools would be with out your ruddy annual trip to Benidorm. So appreciate us for what we are. Highly attractive map gazers. Inconspicuolosy dodging contact hours and steeling your lecture theatres. Yes our subject is easy. No we don't just colour in. The only thing we colour in is the line we put through the physics students we ain't hiring when we are your bosses. #geograohyissosexy","#Durfess7655

Just some thoughts to you, the reader.
What happened to people supporting each other?
Why is everybody so negative to one another these days?
What happened to human touch, people hugging, caring for one another?
Remember that you don't know anyone's personal story/what they're going through.
Think before you make your bold/""jokingly"" hateful statements towards another human being with feelings.
Just think before you act people, it ain't difficult.
It doesn't help that sites such as this give people a platform to post some quite nasty thoughts that are of course going to make people paranoid and thus lead to self destructing thoughts for a good majority.
Social media can be so toxic man, get out there, get off your phone, hug people and have conversations.
Stop being so wound up by social media and so dependent on it.
Social media can be a great thing don't get me wrong, but it's eating away at us all deprevating us of living in the present.
Talk about how you feel.
Do something today that will benefit someone other than yourself and your needs, just one thing even if it's small.
Make a change.
That is all.

Also!!!! Diners must sign up in tables of 12, with a designated head of table who will be responsible for queuing and paying for all tickets (yeah lemme just bank transfer ¬£1200 - that's bloody pocket change )
It just proves that the full Hatfield college experience excludes those from working class/poorer backgrounds and is just downright WANKY. I know it's supposed to be a bit pricey considering its a formal ball but this just misses the mark so much when other colleges (e.g. Cuth's) have had amazing balls for almost half that price.
Pls fix up Hatfield....","#Durfess7077

On that topic - we'll be bringing you more durfesses than ever before, more tindurs than ever before and a whole host of new opportunities throughout the year (which you started to see with our partnerships at the end of last year which raised a pretty neat sum of money for a good cause).
Anyway, hope you're all well. Personally I've thus far read more than 812 comments about <that guy in OADU talking about mensoc> and I thought they were all finished, refreshed the page and there were (I kid you not) 30 more.

Hey Durfess.
I'm a fellow Bangladeshi student in Durham. Not sure if you know about the situation in the capital dhaka where children are being beaten up, girls raped with 4 allegedly dead.
Backstory: having a driving licence in our country is a joke- so is democracy. Two kids were racing driving PUBLIC buses , lost control and killed 2 kids standing on the pavement. This broke out a protest by school kids done peacefully. They checked licences of drivers and stopped those who didn't have one.
The students demanded strict laws to be executed towards these drivers. Over 25000 people were killed in the past 3 years for reckless driving.
But the joke of a government, have laughed, mocked and simply ignored the students. Even saying 2 lives don't matter. This led to them hiring goons to attack these little kids on the road, commanded a media black out and shut off internet and phone network in the capital.
We need international media coverage so please help us-please. Share the articles you find. Let everyone know. Please.","#Durfess5585

Look, an actual study on the effects of being privately educated: http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1474424/
To simplify massively, private schools give the academic boost needed to get into the best universities, and this is the main privilege they give their pupils. The main problem is that state schools cannot hope to match the academic rigour of private schools without massive investment, which is unlikely to happen any time soon. You could therefore argue that privately-schooled students arrive at Durham with a significant advantage, but the gap narrows significantly as graduation approaches.","#Durfess5486

Personally I find the joke of calling the cat exactly what‚Äôs on its collar funnier than yet another cat pun, but to each their own I guess.

Seriously though, unless you are in a seriously not nice place emotionally and reeeaaaallly need to talk to someone don't call nightline just to have someone to talk to on your way home. It's a recorded thing that people walking alone while on their phones are more likely to be targetted by muggers or assault. I know Durham is a realtively safe place and night crime isn't that common (and maybe it's me coming from a pretty rough town), but it's far better to be safe than sorry.

Being cheated on is possibly the worst feeling that can be felt. It makes you feel small, it makes you feel like you aren't good enough, and it makes you feel like you can never trust again.
When you then break up with the cheater and try to be respectful at social occasions, there is nothing worse than seeing and knowing that they have immediately moved on and are getting with other people while you are still recovering from the horrific shock of betrayal.
So this is for anoyone who has been cheated on. You're strong. You're the better person. You have strong morals and a strong personality.

Castle: Targaryen - the rightful rulers, quite incestuous
Hatfield: Lannister - rich attractive arseholes... also fans of incest
Hild Bede: Martell - separate from all the others, predominantly southerners
Chad's: Tully - meant to be one of the good ones but are literally nobody's favourite
Cuth's: Baelish - forever trying to be more than they are
Mildert: Frey - fucking freaks
Aidan's: Arryn - hear about them when you first arrive but barely ever meet anyone from there
Trevs: Bolton - no one likes you
John's: Mormont - nice, dependable people but ultimately nothing special
Marys: Tyrell - Living quarters are aesthetic af, girls run the place and lads are mostly gay
Collingwood: Baratheon - strong, attractive, athletic
Grey: Greyjoy (obvs) - live in a barren wasteland, mostly do their own thing
Ustinov: Order of Maesters - not really considered a college, everyone you meet from there is fucking old

Colleges as Game of Thrones Houses:
JoBo: Starks - can be self-righteous but get treated worse than they deserve
Castle: Targaryen - the rightful rulers, quite incestuous
Hatfield: Lannister - rich attractive arseholes... also fans of incest
Hild Bede: Martell - separate from all the others, predominantly southerners
Chad's: Tully - meant to be one of the good ones but are literally nobody's favourite
Cuth's: Baelish - forever trying to be more than they are
Mildert: Frey - fucking freaks
Aidan's: Arryn - hear about them when you first arrive but barely ever meet anyone from there
Trevs: Bolton - no one likes you
John's: Mormont - nice, dependable people but ultimately nothing special
Marys: Tyrell - Living quarters are aesthetic af, girls run the place and lads are mostly gay
Collingwood: Baratheon - strong, attractive, athletic
Grey: Greyjoy (obvs) - live in a barren wasteland, mostly do their own thing
Ustinov: Order of Maesters - not really considered a college, everyone you meet from there is fucking old
Stockon colleges: Bastards - even the shit colleges are glad they‚Äôre not you, identify with a guy called Jo(h)n Snow",,1521844979,,,297,110,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2018920671707510&id=1944741139125464,

Hey people of Durfess, could you check out and critique my new song's lyrics? I would appreciate it! :D
It's about staying who you want to be and not caring what everyone else thinks!
-------------------------------------------------------------
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original
Le le le le let‚Äô show em‚Äô how we do this!
Le le le le let‚Äôs start the show!
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original! X2
First off I‚Äôm thankful for everyone that follows me
And everyone that doubted me can swallow their apology
I‚Äôm the kinda‚Äô character that‚Äôs written in mythology
Living in the present day it‚Äôs in my biology
To rap about equality and the rock mic properly
It‚Äôs obvious a lot of you could learn from this philosophy
I‚Äôm not a know-it-all I‚Äôm full of curiosity
I‚Äôm fascinated by the stars and their luminosity
Guided by a prophecy workin‚Äô at full velocity
I grew up the classics class of Sean Connery
My women‚Äôs from a James Bond flick I won the lottery
Plus I mold young minds similar to pottery
I just stole your fans better call it in a robbery
I sound so original my clone couldn‚Äôt copy me
No this anatomy belongs to a prodigy
Honestly in my mind nobody is toppin‚Äô me
Le le le le let‚Äô show em‚Äô how we do this!
Le le le le let‚Äôs start the show!
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original! X2
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô blend in how those other men did
Before they even got goin‚Äô their careers ended
But not me I‚Äôm driven by a very different engine
That keeps rippin‚Äô givin‚Äô me incredible momentum
So if you‚Äôre offended by anything I mention
Or anything I wear if you have an objection
Write out a complaint and place in your rectum
Or better yet type it in the comment section
That‚Äôll give this video a little more attention
My God your iPod needs an intervention
Look at you doing that just because your friend did
Be yourself and make your decisions independent
My rhythm is tremendous and lyricism endless
Nobody is similar I see no resemblance
A treat for the senses followed by a question
Tell me‚Ä¶. what is it you see in your reflection?
Le le le le let‚Äô show em‚Äô how we do this!
Le le le le let‚Äôs start the show!
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original! X2
I don‚Äôt wanna be how everybody else is
I don‚Äôt wanna be how everybody else is
I don‚Äôt wanna be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original!
I‚Äôma‚Äô be the only person I‚Äôm supposed to be
And that‚Äôs me it‚Äôs a bonus if they notice me
I make music and use it to buy my groceries
Nowadays I‚Äôm even movin‚Äô units overseas
I‚Äôm busy workin‚Äô while they leave it to a clover leaf
I‚Äôve been original since in my Momma‚Äôs ovaries
I started locally and now they know me globally
Depression and anxiety I talk about em‚Äô openly
Le le le le let‚Äô show em‚Äô how we do this!

Hey people of Durfess, could you check out and critique my new song's lyrics? I would appreciate it! :D
It's about staying who you want to be and not caring what everyone else thinks!
-------------------------------------------------------------
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original
Le le le le let‚Äô show em‚Äô how we do this!
Le le le le let‚Äôs start the show!
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original! X2
First off I‚Äôm thankful for everyone that follows me
And everyone that doubted me can swallow their apology
I‚Äôm the kinda‚Äô character that‚Äôs written in mythology
Living in the present day it‚Äôs in my biology
To rap about equality and the rock mic properly
It‚Äôs obvious a lot of you could learn from this philosophy
I‚Äôm not a know-it-all I‚Äôm full of curiosity
I‚Äôm fascinated by the stars and their luminosity
Guided by a prophecy workin‚Äô at full velocity
I grew up the classics class of Sean Connery
My women‚Äôs from a James Bond flick I won the lottery
Plus I mold young minds similar to pottery
I just stole your fans better call it in a robbery
I sound so original my clone couldn‚Äôt copy me
No this anatomy belongs to a prodigy
Honestly in my mind nobody is toppin‚Äô me
Le le le le let‚Äô show em‚Äô how we do this!
Le le le le let‚Äôs start the show!
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original! X2
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô blend in how those other men did
Before they even got goin‚Äô their careers ended
But not me I‚Äôm driven by a very different engine
That keeps rippin‚Äô givin‚Äô me incredible momentum
So if you‚Äôre offended by anything I mention
Or anything I wear if you have an objection
Write out a complaint and place in your rectum
Or better yet type it in the comment section
That‚Äôll give this video a little more attention
My God your iPod needs an intervention
Look at you doing that just because your friend did
Be yourself and make your decisions independent
My rhythm is tremendous and lyricism endless
Nobody is similar I see no resemblance
A treat for the senses followed by a question
Tell me‚Ä¶. what is it you see in your reflection?
Le le le le let‚Äô show em‚Äô how we do this!
Le le le le let‚Äôs start the show!
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original! X2
I don‚Äôt wanna be how everybody else is
I don‚Äôt wanna be how everybody else is
I don‚Äôt wanna be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original!
I‚Äôma‚Äô be the only person I‚Äôm supposed to be
And that‚Äôs me it‚Äôs a bonus if they notice me
I make music and use it to buy my groceries
Nowadays I‚Äôm even movin‚Äô units overseas
I‚Äôm busy workin‚Äô while they leave it to a clover leaf
I‚Äôve been original since in my Momma‚Äôs ovaries
I started locally and now they know me globally
Depression and anxiety I talk about em‚Äô openly
Le le le le let‚Äô show em‚Äô how we do this!
Le le le le let‚Äôs start the show!
I don‚Äôt wanna‚Äô be how everybody else is
I‚Äôd much rather be original! X2",,1520505455,,,9,29,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2010658569200387&id=1944741139125464,

Hello everyone,
I would please like to introduce you to something that is very precious and special to me.
When I was 4, I was given a Lion King present, as the Lion King was quite a popular film at the time. For over 15 years now, I have kept the little Simba that came with the set. He may be Simba to you, but to me, he is called Louie. When I was about 8, I was a fan of the Three Musketeers film, which was where I first heard the name 'Louie'. I loved the name, and felt compelled to attach it to what then was my favourite toy.
I called him Louie, and have kept him for over 15 years.
I remember crying my eyes out when I must have been 8 or 9, after I thought I had lost him, only for him to be found by my parents . I also remember bringing him in to school in Year 5 to meet all of my friends. He also stayed in my company throughout secondary school and snuck into my suitcase on trips to The Gambia and the U.S. I have had Louie for most of my life.
Louie brings me good luck. He always is sitting on my desk as I write summatives, and is always good company. He really is the one last connection I have to my childhood, and all of the happy memories from it.
Everyone has one precious memento from their childhood - Louie is mine.","#Durfess2130

Don't really have much sympathy for those on strike, moving away from a defined benefit scheme is in line with the rest of the workforce, almost all private sector companies have moved away from these types of pensions. Yeah obviously it would suck to hear your pension won't be as big as you hoped it would be but at the end of the day their pensions are still going to be better than most in the private sector.
It's all cute and trendy to join a picket line and post on social media about your solidarity but you'll say nothing about how the ¬£7 billion funding gap should be plugged. Of course I'm sure you'd be happy to take other people's money and have them foot the bill but you'd never support having higher tuition fees to fund a pension scheme that people of our age could only dream of getting when we retire.","#Durfess2075

OK so I need advice: Money or passion?
I struggling to decide between committing to a career in which I know I will make a lot of money and wouldn't mind doing and something that I am very strongly inclined towards and am actually really passionate and excited about.
I would appreciate any advice but please don't comment with the whole ""do what you love! Money doesn't matter!"" because, I'm sorry, but that's just such an oversimplified picture of reality. Money is a tool that can open a lot of doors. With money, I can travel, live in a nice house, in a nice area and provide a comfortable life for my children (if I have any)- giving them all the opportunities in the world. I have not really struggled in my life. I am not wealthy but I come from a fairly well-off background. However, I have had periods of struggle, and from this I know that struggle/ poverty is no joke. It's a horrible, alienating and sometimes even violating thing to go through. I do not want to trivialise it and I feel like the ""do what you love! Money doesn't matter!"" crowd do. So while I agree that you should ""do what you love"", when all of these banks and law firms are advertising to Durham students, I feel stupid rejecting the opportunities they present me with. Additionally, I find it frustrating when people who come from very wealthy backgrounds who already have wealth (property, a trust fund etc) say ""money doesn't matter!"" Of course it doesn't matter to you- you were born into wealth so you don't ever need to think about how you will be able to provide for a family in the future or make ends meet. However....
This thing that I am inclined to do is just so fascinating. I can't stop thinking about it, I already feel a part of it and I'm just so passionate. I can maybe try to get involved in my spare time instead of doing it as a job, but it just doesn't feel the same. With regards to the money issue, it would make me around ¬£45k a year. I know that's not that little but considering the money banking or law jobs can make you, it seems like nothing and I know that it wouldn't be able to give me the lifestyle I want. So what do I do?
Please help!","#Durfess1752
OK so I need advice: Money or passion?
I struggling to decide between committing to a career in which I know I will make a lot of money and wouldn't mind doing and something that I am very strongly inclined towards and am actually really passionate and excited about.
I would appreciate any advice but please don't comment with the whole ""do what you love! Money doesn't matter!"" because, I'm sorry, but that's just such an oversimplified picture of reality. Money is a tool that can open a lot of doors.

You can tell a lot about the people standing ‚Äòin solidarity‚Äô with the striking lecturers.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Trevs. The architecture is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of advanced geometry most of the hexagons will go over a typical viewer‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Trevs‚Äô hexagonal outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their shape draws heavily from 'Kiddies First Shapes', for instance. The Trevelyanites understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the edges of these shapes, to realise that they‚Äôre not just hexagons- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Trevs truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Trevs' existential catchphrase ‚ÄúTake me home, Elvet Hill Road‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Trevs' location on the hill. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Trevs‚Äô genius shapes reveal themselves on the hill. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ
And yes, by the way, i DO have a hexagon tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

You are nothing to me but just another hater hating on my anonymous Durfess cause you have no clue who I am irl. I will wipe out that thing you call your friends, social status and basically right to participate in any social event in Durham, mark my word. You think you can get away with writing stuff like that on my posts? Think again, as right now I am contacting my SRC links across all colleges and we're tracing everything about you. I know everyone, at anytime and I can steal your friends in over 700 ways and that's just by walking down the street. Not only am I extensively revered in the DSU but I have access to the entire funds of the DSU and I will use them to their full extent to boycott you and your raves.

Mr commentor on that post, this its made me feel worse thanks, I'm trying to not over react but just because i confessed my personal problems anonymously does not limit me to a stereotype. Im really struggling to fit in and youve just made my christmas a bit shitter. No offence i dont want a fox hunt (you may enjoy those) but that comment really pierced me and i commented due to a genuine unease at uni. Again merry christmas everyone.","#Durfess339

I'm starting to worry about myself. Last year I was up and down like an emotional yo-yo, ranging from complete ecstasy to utter misery in a matter of hours, whereas this year I feel like it's just been one long, slightly declining plateau. It's like a dull hum in the background, a baseline of mediocre resignation that I can't shake. Is this normal? Am I depressed? Is this just what happens as we get older? For fear of sounding like I'm from fucking peep show, is there something wrong with me?","#Durfess336

Hey, man. Sorry you feel this way. When you're at a university like Durham it's so easy to compare yourself to people, but at the end of the day it doesn't really matter! I mean I don't know where you came from but it seems as though the DU sports teams (and drama, music) are predominantly made up of extremely privileged students (from private school backgrounds) who were forced into them from a young age. Massive fucking generalisation but bear with me. What I'm trying to say is that a lot of the skills people arrive with at university, they have because that's what their parents told them to do it or they were forced to in school. In a way, its a privilege to be able to discover something you enjoy or take interest in on your own! There is so so so much shit going on so go and see what takes your fancy. The world is your oyster! (Plus, there's nothing wrong with focussing on your degree too, cause I guess that's what we're here for). Plus, talk to your mates - they'll understand!","#Durfess259

Since we're on the topic of religion, my favourite Dawkins quote about the world:
""The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored. In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.‚Äù","#Durfess247

A few words on today's news abouts David Van Eggan. His comments regarding rape and sexual assault are disgusting. It is as if he goes out of his way to offend every group on this planet, as if it's some sick twisted game.
Has he not learnt from his days at St Olave's? Last year he was booked to do a talk with another former student on 'White lives matter's, in an attempt to make a mockery of the black lives matter campaign that was prevalent in the news at the time. The posters used for this campaign featured neo-nazi imagery, white supremacy and racially divisive comments. The actions of the current and former student body led to the talk being cancelled.
The Durham union has made the right decision to remove him.","#Durfess233
