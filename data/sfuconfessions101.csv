I‚Äôm in my last year of university, and I realized that I am not passionate about my major. I am now really nervous because I am applying for co-op soon, and I feel like I don‚Äôt have the skills to apply to the jobs I like/want. I am interested in pursuing a project management position in tech companies, but a lot of these positions require/prefer candidates with a technical background. I am open to learning new skills (ex like coding) if I need to, but I am disappointed at myself because I feel like I have wasted my time, effort, and money. I wished I was able to figure this out earlier and switch my study to something I like more that would be applicable for my career.","#13371

I have a ‚Äúhands-on nature‚Äù class this term and the professor‚Äôs theory ‚Äúblows‚Äù my mind. In tradition this class gives students option to work on projects individually or in groups, but for this term, the prof says we‚Äôre not allowed to work individually due to social distancing, we are only allowed to work in groups due to the pandemic and the social distancing thing. His reason was because we‚Äôll have less access to places and materials so it is easier and less demanding for us if we work in groups.
I am just annoyed because the course outline says we can work individually, I am not holding up well in the past 2 months, the pandemic alone is stressful for me, this is just gonna make me more stressful. ;(","#11368

Hope you are all safe and well. In regards to COVID-19, we should bring awareness through SFSS to our respective faculty boards on giving students more options for this current semester. For a lot of students it's really a struggle to not have in-person instructors guiding them through their courses and it's even harder for students who have group projects that require coordination with their peers (ig. BUS 361). I personally don't believe we should be panicking over passing a course when our health and safety is priority during a global pandemic.
Just like the image shown here, UBC's science faculty is already willing to provide alternative courses of action for their student's current semester.

I was working on some already overdue assignments, and by the time I was done I realized I had missed my last bus down the mountain. So my smart ass decided to run down to production(10 min car, 20 min bike, 50 min walk) in the middle of the night to catch another bus that would get me home which comes in 30 min. Yes, I have lost the decision making abilities a normal human being should have after spending a whole day trying to BS and reach the word count for an essay(still was like 150 short). So about a quarter way down, struggling to breath, freezing to death and contemplating why did I choose to go to SFU, some dude was nice enough to offer me a ride down. During the little time I had on this short ride I learned that he's a second year Beedie student, when I asked him how is it he said that people dont talk to each other that much, which surprised me, I thought most Business students would be more outgoing and socialize more(as a cs student :P). And also learned that hes on a delivery job from 12-4am, godam, mad respect for the guy as those hours sound crazy to me. Before I could speak with him a bit more, we got to the station, so I thanked him and waved goodbye. I think these acts of kindness will remain in the hearts of those that received help, when I get a car in the future, and see someone walking down the road, I would probably be reminded of today and do the same for them.","#11515

I wish western women can care about the terrible conditions and environments that women around the world endure as much as they do about their own issues.
How many more girls will be silenced, ignored, beaten, raped, mutilated and killed for basic rights and freedoms until the modern feminist movement take notice?
Can you imagine the political pressure we can put on the theocratic/patriarchal leaders that enforce cultures of female subservience? There are still hundreds of millions of women who are illiterate, forced into child marriages, genitalia mutilated and endure domestic/sexual abuse in societies where the criminals are protected and commended.

I Paid $1000 To Socialize With Pedophiles
Hi, my name is M***, and I participated in the SFU co-op term during the Summer of 2019.
I worked for the Society to End Homelessness in Burnaby for two months, but I was pulled out of my co-op term early due to unsafe circumstances.
This is my story.
Before I went in for the interview, my co-op advisor called me and asked if I ‚Äúwas sure about applying at The Society To End Homelessness.‚Äù I thought this was a strange question, but I assured him that I had previous experiences working with homeless populations in the past as I have volunteered in the Downtown Eastside for six months before my co-op. Little did I know that this phone call was supposed to be a warning.
I was hired by C****** to be a tech supporter for the entire four months of the summer. My job from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday involved posting on their various social media as well as answering emails. On Thursday is when the Society South Side Community Church and serve the local homeless population lunch.
The job was easy enough, and it was just like your typical 9-5 job.
But a small part of me always dreaded going to work on Thursdays. Ever since I started working there in May, there would always be a man wearing a surgical mask who would constantly try to talk to me. If I weren‚Äôt giving him the attention that he wanted, he would poke me on the shoulder, or he would get close to my face and yell at me. Sometimes he would get close enough to my face where I can make out the wrinkles around his eyes.
When I would bring this up to my boss C******, however, she would always tell me that I am exaggerating and that he is just ‚Äúfriendly.‚Äù
Fast forward to the end of June, and a volunteer on Thursday discreetly told me that the surgical mask man was actually a PEDOPHILE and that ‚Äúhe likes young girls,‚Äù and I ‚Äúshould stay away from him.‚Äù I was horrified to have learned this information so late into my co-op term because I have just spent the past two months talking to a pedophile who could have molested me during all those times he would corner me and try to speak to me.
After that Thursday, I reached out to the two previous co-op students before me (who were also young girls), and I asked for their advice as well as their experiences. I was disheartened to learn that they have also experienced the same events as me but on far worse terms. They received death threats from men and C****** did nothing to protect them, even when she was present during one of these threats.
When one of the previous co-op students reported to C****** about almost being sexually assaulted, C****** said: ‚Äúmy, looks like someone has an admirer.‚Äù
When I confronted C****** about how she failed to warn me that I have been talking to a pedophile for the past two months, she said: ‚Äúeveryone knows he likes young girls, just stay away from him.‚Äù
The three of us were furious at the treatments we suffered under C******, so we decided to report this co-op position to SFU immediately so that no one would ever have to experience this job position ever again.
This part of the story is the most extended section, but the shorter version is that the three of us managed to talk to my co-op advisor, but he already knew about previous complaints other co-op students have filed. That was why, to his defence, he tried to ‚Äúwarn‚Äù me about this job during that phone call we had before my interview with C******.
So, SFU knew about this co-op position and how dangerous it is, and yet they STILL agreed to send students to The Society To End Homelessness term after term.
SFU knew about the previous traumatizing experiences other students have experienced at this job, but they did not confront C******.
SFU co-op advisors had a ‚Äúbad feeling‚Äù about this job position, and they did nothing about it.
When I was hired, I could have easily been another victim.
The conclusion of all of this is I was given a partial-refund for my co-op term due to my withdrawal from the program.
So I wasted $1000 to socialize with pedophiles for two months.
SFU said they blacklisted The Society To End Homelessness, but frankly, I don‚Äôt believe them.","#11509

As a casual cyclist, I came across to be an asshole I always hated today: when I got off from school and picked up a friend in the Lowe nearby Renfrew station, waiting for lines of vehicles to move across the railways, and I got totally distracted by the bikes coming from the right and ignored the bikes coming from the left, so then I saw a gap in front of me and then moved and a female biker just happened to move forward from the bike lane on my left. I abruptly stopped and so did she, no one got hurt, but I happened to have an anger that I thought ""she has the stop sign, she should wait"". But after a few minutes, I realized I became the asshole I always hated that if I did not move forward, just let her go first, may be there is only one person to be upset instead of two.
Anyways, I am writing this post only to express that both drivers and bikers should understand each other even more, perhaps make eye contacts to each other while go through traffics.
Also, I do want to apologize to that lady biker.","#11508

One of my greatest regrets as an undergrad is not socializing more.

I should have asked that girl out, the one I merely thought was cute at the time, the one who happens to possess a gem of a soul.
Should have.
This is all past tense now of course.
I am graduating. I realized too late of my mistakes, of my misguided ways. I tried to make mends of it in my final semester, do what I should have done from the first. Yet that does not undo what has been done.

Now I leave school with the few memories that was made in haste, with the few friendships that were revived from the deep, with hopes that those who read this will not walk the same path I was on again.",,1570507342,,,241,36,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2321413294652651&id=388417724618894,

I'm single. Or should I say: single since birth. Never been in a relationship, but I've had some feelings for some girls before. And in some rare occasions, some girls developed feelings towards me...but those just didn't turn out right. Here's the dilemma. I want my first relationship in a way that it's the first relationship for both my girlfriend and myself. So that it is a memorable experience for me and for her. I can already see that most of you will be disgusted. As if I can choose. No, you're right. I'm nowhere close to being in a position to choose my first girlfriend. Believe me, whenever I have that desire to date someone who has never dated before, I insult myself saying how dare I even think of that. I feel like a worthless piece of trash for thinking that way. But at the same time, the desire is still present in me. Like I get it. If I wish to date an inexperienced girl every single relationship, then that's messed up. But it's my one wish for my first relationship ever. I feel like dating someone who is romantically experienced while I myself is inexperienced will simply degrade my self esteem. I'll be caught up in the self degradation from the inferiority complex towards the girl's past significant other. But again, I consciously feel like how dare I even think that I have the power to choose. Like who would even want to date a guy who thinks that way. You know what? That's basically the reason why I am single: being caught up in a meaningless thought even though no one would want me in the first place.","#11506

For the longest time, I believed in the 'there's a single right person for you that will eventually show up' that pop culture keeps selling us.
So apparently, in psychology, our belief in this ""ideal person that will show up on their own"" is considered ""a willingness to believe in something that has no basis and can't be proven"".
Now that I've thought about it for a little while, I realized that most of the people I know who are in relationships met their S.O because they went out of their way to meet people at school clubs and events, and almost everyone I know who is still ""waiting for their dream person to show up"", is, well, still single and waiting.

Yesterday morning I was in the men's washroom in the applied science building and noticed someone standing in one of the stalls. I realized its a friend once i noticed the unique hair peaking at the top of the stall, and the timberland boots he always wears. So i thought why not jump scare the fuck outta him right? so I waited in front of the stall for him to come out and waited for the perfect moment. Once he opened the door I jump scared him, and right at THAT moment I was reassured that it was NOT my friend, but an absolute stranger with the exact same hairstyle and boots. He jumped backwards into the air and landed ass first into the toilet. Absolutely traumatized and afraid he said ""WHAT THE FUCK MAN, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?"". Completely confused and shocked as to what just happened I replied: ""Listen man... I fucked up... good luck"" and proceeded to exit the washroom.
I would like to apologize to this person. I hope you understand what happened now.
Good luck.","#11503

Im talking the real deal here, with a pre-massage foot bath and organic coconut oil, essential oils, hot towels, ambient lighting and shit. Like feet are one of the most neglected body parts and I just want to have her relax and feel appreciated by giving her feet the attention they need. Watching her expressions as I generate sensations in a neglected body part that even she did not know was capable of imparting such pleasure. I visualize her releasing all the pent up stress as I focus on various pressure points utilizing a multitude of techniques (tapping, rubbing, pressing, tugging, squeezing etc.). It doesnt even have to be sexual, as it is already a deeply intimate exchage of energy that is cathartic for both parties.","#11500

Saw confession #11472 and I wanted to share my story. Just want to share this to whoever that needs a little dose of motivation/ encouragement right at this moment :
I was also in AP first year into university, (academic probation not some elite classes like when you took AP classes from highschool), got myself into the BOT program right at the beginning of second year, failed two same quantitative courses twice and had to check in with a senior academic advisor to ask for a third time repeat permission so I can move on with my degree.
I had two very distinct memories during that period of time, (1) my mom and I didn't talk through the entire Christmas for two months when she first heard about the BOT program and (2) the smirk and coldness from the advisor at the time telling me that I might not be good enough for the faculty and asking ""if I've considered trying out a new university/ college/ program etc."" adding, ""but if you want to try you can try coming back to ask again in a year or two years when you have good enough grades.""
Fair, but often times throughout the years I would repeatedly ask myself whether or not I will ever graduate, or if I didn't graduate would my life would turn into some kind of mess - but I know when you felt the whole world started looking down on you, you had to be that person to stick up for yourself.
So for that next couple of years I stayed in the library for longer hours, did whatever practices for so many times that I would start to understand the concept, started to speak up and become more active, worked extra hard for whatever - I went back to the same advisor a semester after with straight As and had my permission to retake the courses.
I kept the motivation up for the rest of my school years and I graduated. Long story short, there will always be so many challenges in university, when you step into the adult life at work, or other times that made you question about yourself, made you want to give up, but bottom line you gotta stick up for yourself. Tell yourself you will make it and if you really didn't feel the motivations, fake it until you make it and you will make it.","#11489

CS is a worthless degree. I honestly thought I was so cool studying CS so I could become a 1337 hacker or make a cool vidya so I can finally have girls understand me and I get to have them all or whatever but honestly? CS is just floating point arithmetic errors, segmentation faults, and neckbeards that show their utmost superiority by ""compiling from source"" and talking about how fast their computers run after installing gentoo (compiled from source, of course) and only using open source code published under GPL v3 licensing. (ir)Relatable shitposts in the form of github repos relating to machine learning¬© and blockchain technology‚Ñ¢(when 70% of the time it's just a fork from someone else's repo with a few lines of changed code)

CS is a worthless degree. I honestly thought I was so cool studying CS so I could become a 1337 hacker or make a cool vidya so I can finally have girls understand me and I get to have them all or whatever but honestly? CS is just floating point arithmetic errors, segmentation faults, and neckbeards that show their utmost superiority by ""compiling from source"" and talking about how fast their computers run after installing gentoo (compiled from source, of course) and only using open source code published under GPL v3 licensing. (ir)Relatable shitposts in the form of github repos relating to machine learning¬© and blockchain technology‚Ñ¢(when 70% of the time it's just a fork from someone else's repo with a few lines of changed code)

I don't know if I should say I'm depressed but I'm just done with my life. In high school I missed out on so much, I never drank or smoked or partied. I didn't even get amazing grades I literally just did nothing all day long. Fast forward 2 years later I'm still doing nothing important with my life. My parents put so much pressure on me that my grades have dropped so now there's no point in staying in university if I'm gonna take like 6 years to graduate. In the past 2 months not a day has gone by without me crying myself to sleep. I've gained a lot of weight because all I wanna do is get high and eat all day long. I even skip work to stay at home and get high so now I'm broke and on the weekends I get so wasted that when I come home my family doesn't talk to me. So I'm seriously thinking about moving away to LA or New York. I have us citizenship anyways. I feel like once I move out and have a lot of responsibilities I'll step up game and realize what it's like to live in the real world. I can go on and on talking about how many problems I have like I'm 20 and I've never even kissed anyone, I'm Muslim but also bisexual, I failed last semester, my family hates me, I'm broke. But in the end the point is I wanna move far far away.","#11486

Great, we made the seat 3 feet long so now your legs awkwardly hang off the front. Wanna have a table to place your laptop on? Awesome, now your seat doesnt have a backing and you'll be sore within a half hour. Wanna study in a quiet area? Try the 5th and 6th floors of the library, it comes equipped with every scent you could imagine.","#11485

I am a white Canadian guy in his early 20s that spent about a semester in Tokyo on a foreign exchange. I went to a local cafe often, and the barista essentially asked me out by writing me a letter. She is very sweet, incredibly nice person, and although I was leaving in 2 weeks, I figured why not. Important point: her English is not particularly good. Also important to note: although this woman is 33, she looks and acts much younger - I thought she was early 20s. This might just be how people act in Japan, I'm not sure. But she definitely didn't act/look/communicate in the way that a 33-year old in Canada would (not even CBC girls lol).
So, we went out for drinks. She gives me another card when we first meet-up (which I didn't read until later.) We were having fun, and then she goes ""I want you to be my lover tonight."" It was a bit direct but I chalked it up to cultural differences (I know that they have different views on sex in Japan). She also wanted us to take a bunch of pictures together - again just assumed it was a Japanese thing - they seemed to be obsessed with selfies. We go back to my place, and before we do anything at all, I really make sure that she understands that I am not staying in Japan, that I don't want anything serious, etc. She seems to be ok with that.
During sex, she says ""I love you."" Which freaked me out. Afterward I tried to explain to her that you shouldn't say that so quickly, it's only when you've known someone for a long time. I (think) I had read somewhere that the word for ""like"" and ""love"" are the same in Japanese, so I assumed it was just a lost in translation moment. She said she's only had a couple boyfriends in her life.
I later open the card and it's excessively long and says ""I love you from the bottom of my heart."" A bit much, obviously, but again I just assumed that it was a mistranslation on her part.
I saw her at the cafe a few more times and we went to dinner/had sex once more before I left. I told her that I didn't want her to wait for me to return to Japan because I don't know when I will be back, but that she could email me and I'll stay in touch. I bought her a small gift (a French press coffee maker) since she is a barista and had never used one.
On the day I left, I stopped by to say hello, and she gave me a huge bag of presents, along with a ton of pictures of her and us and...another huge letter. Way too much, but of course I said thank you and promised to say in touch over email (she doesn't have Facebook). When I finally got back to America a few days, I have 2 emails from her, both really long. The second one says that she created a Facebook account to see me and to add her. She has no other friends on Facebook.
At this point, I am kind of hesitant to stay in touch. She is a nice person, but I do not want to have any long term relationship with her (even if I did return to Japan.) We had fun but the feelings just weren't there. I don't want to just ignore her, as she is genuinely one of the nicest people I've ever met, but I am afraid that by adding her on Facebook, staying in touch, etc. she will obsess over me and not move on.
tl;dr: Japanese woman seems to be obsessed with me. I don't want to break her heart, because she is a genuinely sweet person, but I'm worried that staying in touch will give her the wrong idea.","#11480

Now I had actually booked the room, but I decided to play along. I asked them when they booked it, and they said a few days prior. They then walked in and put their stuff on the table. Now I had a some friends in another room so i decided to be nice. I got up and packed quietly. The couple ended up exchanging a glance and a smirk, but I pretended not to notice.
As I was leaving I decided to nonchalantly say I had the room booked and that I knew they were lying right from the start. The faces on them was PRICELESS. They went from amusement to pure terror. They grabbed their stuff and started apologizing, but before i could say anything they RAN. Literally got up and ran. I lowkey thought they sh*t themselves.

I was in my first year of SFU and I was already in academic probation by the second semester, fast forward I took the BOT program , I was doing okay for the next few semesters then i ended up getting another F which led to myself getting an ""RTW"" notice. I remember feeling so scared and doomed because now I had to go to a college and improve my grades before being able to transfer back to SFU. Luckily I went to Douglas college took 4 classes and received a 3.9 average and got back into SFU after 1 semester, at Douglas i became more open and talkative (the environment there is really different from SFU) and it taught me to be able to ask my instructors or peers for help. If you're on academic probation, the world isn't ending you can make it out!!

If you're on academic probation, the world isn't ending you can make it out!!
(Classes i took were CMNS 1217, 1216, 1104 and CRIM (don't remember the number but equivalent to CRIM 131)",,1568854598,,,60,7,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2286074828186498&id=388417724618894,

Yesterday I had a morning lecture in AQ and there was really loud construction going on right above our class. Like there was literally loud booms and crashes and even the projector shook. No joke, small bits of rumble from the ceiling fell on my desk and my cup of tea. I felt like Cersei trying to get out of the red keep while drogon was burning everything. Our prof tried to call the project manager to get them to stop and the student services to get us moved to another class but after multiple attempts to contact them they just said they had no where else to move us to. Like for half of our 3 hour class we had to deal with constant loud bangs and parts of the ceiling possibly falling on our heads.","#11470

So I don't know if I'm overreacting or not but here's the drama.
TL;DR: I have a friend that I haven't talked to for a year or two and it seems like she thinking I'm not worth being friends with?
Originally we met as coworkers at a part-time job, which I had been with for longer than her. We would sometimes go for dinner and complain about our boss being so nitpicky, bossy and mean when we're only being paid min wage. So I thought we were sorta close and we shared our other friend/family drama with each other. We ended up quitting a few months apart from each other and I got another part-time job that was better, while being a full-time college student still. She decided to focus on graduating first and we still hung out off and on, mostly just to eat dinner because she's a foodie (which idk how she had money for because she didn't work for at least a year and a half). The problem was that she was hella flaky and kept cancelling or rescheduling our hang outs to later in the day (I'm talking like 9pm or 10pm on weekdays) or another day. I brushed it off but was internally pretty annoyed.
Fast forward to her graduating from college before me (she's younger than me, but not working) and she was telling me she was getting a lot of shit from her family for not finding a job right after university. Luckily, my other friend's job was hiring and I referred her to the job and she got hired. She didn't treat me at all but we hung out a bit more so I invited her to my birthday, and she said yes. Then on the day of my birthday before she was supposed to pick me up, she asked me if she could just treat me to dessert instead of going to my birthday dinner because she didn't want to socialize with a lot of new people. I had to convince her to go because there weren't that many people going due to busy schedules/being out of the country.
Then my dog who I had since I was really young past away and I was grieving, we met up for dinner the day after which I thought was her way of comforting me, I talked about it for a bit and teared up but she looked uncomfortable so I stopped talking about it. My other friends took me out, treated me to bubble tea and dinner and comforted me at that time which I really appreciated, but she didn't.
At some point during that year we were supposed to meet up and she kept rescheduling and rescheduling till really late at night and I had work the next day. So I called her out on it finally and she got really defensive and said we could go out a little bit later than the original time because she was at the gym (seems like the gym is her usual excuse for rescheduling even if we make plans days in advance) and since I was still sorta annoyed and I had to wake up early the next day I cancelled. And after that we barely talked for 2 years.
Now I find out the reason she doesn't wanna hang out with me from another friend is that because I don't drive/have a car, its a hassle to pick me up (I have a phobia of driving because of an accident from childhood and she lives just a few blocks away) and that I'm a picky eater and I only like certain restaurants (I'm still in university and have a part-time job, I can't afford to eat at some of the restaurants she like to eat at and when we would hang out we would both suggest places and decide that way. She's the one that didn't want kbbq because our clothes would smell or pasta because she said it was gross). So am I overreacting or should I be rightfully pissed?","#12466

IAT 233
I took it a while ago, but I am still traumatized by the experience in this course. Whenever someone talks about IAT 233, tears start swelling up in my eyes. I will feel depressed all of a sudden. I couldn‚Äôt stand staying in Surrey Campus for a long period of time, I often have a weird feeling when I step into those studios. I felt sick when I walk pass the food court in Surrey Central. I am still having nightmares about those group projects in 233.
Not to mention that is how I have difficulties dealing with group projects now. I am always afraid of people hating me for not being online on google doc or hate me for not able to show up in group meetings.
Smh‚Ä¶ is it just me? is this my problem???","#12464

I gained a little bit more of self respect for myself so I ignored him and he blocked me. A year later (few days ago) I saw him on campus and he UGLYYYYYYYYYY (thank god) Karma got him well.

Have you ever put in a substantial amount of effort into an assignment only to get an awful mark? This happened to me today. I got the second lowest mark in my class for a writing assignment and it dropped my grade substantially. But this post isn't necessarily about complaining about bad marks, the assignment just gave me this realization of how awful it is to live in this stupid fucking societal construct.
If I say my major, I suspect it'll give away who I am, but I just have to say that university STEM programs are infuriating. All I want to do is learn and discover things for the greater good of humanity. Thing is, if I want to do that, I first need to do arbitrarily well in three dozen or so courses so I can get an arbitrary number from 0 to 4.33 that represents how smart I am. Then I have to get accepted into grad school if I want to make it into academia.
Some people may scoff at this, but I just want to do the thing I'm passionate about. Money doesn't matter to me, but without money in this world, you're dead. I would do the thing I love for free if I could, but it's not an option.
Now I'm already financially burdened, and you might guess that it stresses me out, which it does. The thought that I might not be able to pay tuition, or rent, scares me. Being homeless is not exactly how you get into academia.
On top of grades and money, there's emotion too. I can tell you first hand, getting that assignment back really left a toll on me. The way my professor criticized me, he didn't just want to tell me I was wrong or that I did badly, he wanted to tell me I was stupid. I could feel it with his condescending presence. During class there were always these little microaggressions that I would pick up on. He would ask us if anybody was following what he was saying, then all of us would look at him with a blank stare because we don't even know where to start; he would give this snide look telling us to ""ask more questions then"". In other classes he would ask students to derive these unnecessary, convoluted equations right in front of him and he would just stare at them judgingly until they did something about it.
What I want to know is what gives him this right to be so snide? What does he know of our lives? If he knows so much then why doesn't he try helping us instead of trying to demoralize us?
What I also want to know is what gives him the right to dictate our future? What gives anyone the right to do that? It's just... Not fair. It's really hard to go on knowing you don't control your own life. And on top of that, you get this feeling that you're a failure for not being in control of your own life, and then it's this never ending circle. You start realizing you're doing worse, and you beat yourself up because you're holding yourself to a higher standard. Suddenly, you start thinking that beating yourself up is a good thing, because you're just holding yourself up to that standard. It's not healthy, it's just reality.
I'm sorry for the depressing tone of this post. I'll leave you with a quote from a wise man:

It goes between I am all they have, they depend on me and others have had it worse so I must not feel this way... and I literally have organs in my body failing from the abuse and neglect of the past.
I dont think we ever intentionally hurt anyone. I dont think my parents did either - they were/are just too caught up in their thing to ever consider my perspective. Atleast my mom admitted that she feels bad for me and everything I have been through.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an unpopular opinion or if there is just a very vocal minority but am I the only one that isn‚Äôt opposed to the tuition hike? Honestly, the increase makes sense when you consider what SFU has to do to continue being a competitive university in Canada. I can see why people are upset but at the same time people need to realize all of the services and facilities on campus are expensive. Even after the hike it‚Äôs still likely the administrative salaries are going to be cut as well to help balance the budget.
If you are that upset with the school you‚Äôre allowed to leave. If you want SFU to truly see the negative effects of a tuition hike then a large number of students need to dropout or no new people apply for upcoming years.","#12456

One of my prof's gender neutrality debate have rung quite a bell within my mind. Apart from all the mass hysteria his voice has caused he has initiated a great dialogue. That of what are the limits of feminism ? Where is it leading to ? It is an extremely important topic which needs widespread discussion i think because its impacting us all in one way or the other.
Now I am no guru, nor am I a very learned man, I am just a regular undergrad guy living the substandard life that of a normal student. My views are purely based on my personal experieces and so please do not take any of my views personally as its just a discussion starter, I mean no disrespect for anyone. I want to recount my work experience during my internship last summers. I cannot specify what profession it was what company it was with but it was >6k a month job and the only reason I am stating this is for you to understand the people about whom this is concerned with were all very smart people, very learned. No, it was no labour work, but a scientific job. There was this colleague of mine, who to put it mildly, was not very smart. However having said that, this was his first job experience (his first internship ever) and was the youngest and least experienced of us all. He was very helpful, always ready to take on night shifts, always ready to help others but as I said before he was not that smart and was somewhat lacking in confidence. Now, at times he would make silly mistakes at work, mostly they were silly mistakes . I tried to pat him on back and give him confidence and help him as much as I could from my past experiences but I could not do that always as he had to work alone or with other group members at times. I noticed he was being unfairly targeted by women. Its weird because he was on good terms with most of the guys at our work but women seemed to be quite hard on me mostly. Often I overheard the girls talking shit about him on his back at lunch time, like"" ** is always asking doubts, he gives me headache !"" And other 2 girls would agree. I would always find this quite erratic because the girls were putting him under so much pressure and all it was making him do was make more mistakes. Again i will like to repeat, it was just the women surprisingly. The guys were all very supportive of him (Yes there were only 4 girls at our work). In meetings, this dude was often bashed by women for being not good enough and that he should be focussing more and bla bla. Once all limits were crossed when one of the girls just laid into him. And I mean it when I say this. She went too far ahead to say ""I am not your mama who will keep telling you how to do stuff and you need to use your own brain ...."" She laid into him for good 10 minutes in front of everyone. And what astonished me the most was how cool this dude was. He ofcourse had his head down with disappointment but did not say a single word, and only listened quietly. I had to cut the lady's rant short after 10 minutes. The poor bloke was completely distraught. It was a sad sight to see his depressed face. I could honestly see this guy was trying quite hard but of course it was a new experience and he was youngest out of all of us so it was obvious he was going to make mistakes. At least that's what I felt. Other may disagree . Now coming back to my point of feminism and all that, I am a gentleman. I treat every human equally , I dont discriminate in terms of colour, race, gender etc. So please again dont take me wrong here. All I am saying is that why do men have to endure shit most of the time? You know when I spoke to this dude later after the meeting I asked him that why did he not reply back ? Afterall he was working in a team of 2 and he his partner were both at fault but only he was targeted as always. Like why did he not speak up? I was amazed at the humility of the dude when he said"" I have been brought up respecting women, I never argue with a girl, never, no matter if its my fault or not. Had I said something it would have only added further fuel to fire and it would have been disastrous to see 2 colleagues exchanging blows for the company."" Now my point is , I can assure you guys, had it been another woman, she would have ended up crying and then it would have been a huge deal, an almost corporate issue and who knows what. Evreryone would have been supported her. But since this was one respectful young bloke people get a license to use him as a soft target? If he had cried, he would have been labelled a p***y, not man enough, baby boy and bla bla. Why is it that in today's world everone supports a woman? I spoke about this issue to the supervisor and nothing happened. Can you believe it? ALL that was done was that the lady who laid into the guy was ""reminded of her mistake and asked not to repeat again"". I can bet you having worked the same company, that had it been genders reversed, a guy laying into the woman, in a good firm like that, guys would have been maybe suspended or who knows maybe fired or what not. And many of you may disagree below but thats the sad reality of today's world. A girl sobs and complains about anything about a guy, the guy is presumed guilty right away, but how true is it for opposite sex? I saw it with my own eyes how belittle the poor bloke was made to feel and what was the girl punished with? Nothing, just a slap on the wrist. And some of you may be thinking that the mustake the bloke made was huge, again I can assure you it was not the end of the world. He had made a genuine mistake and for which he had already asked for forgiveness beforehand. But no, the lady had to lay into him and toss his reputation into the garbage. I mean this is just an example but this is an everyday thing i feel in today's world. Guys are unfairly targeted, scrutinized and blamed when its not even their fault in first place or even if it is, its not that big of a deal. You all may think I am saying this because I am guy, I think just the very fact that I am not comfortable writing this on my profile but as an anonymous here is proof enough how hard it is to speak against these issues. These days you just cannot speak against women in any sort or you are labelled misogynist or whatever you may call me now. I sincerely believe in gender equality but am against feminism of this sort, its almost autocratic and inhumane. I have no idea where our society is headed to but I guess the only way to live in it is in the shadows.","#12450

Dear SFU students,
Recently I faced a mentally traumatizing experience in C lot at 8pm. Previously I was part of the SFU parking lookout group. Many of the students in that group did not share my views. Basically that group informs students of where parking officers are ticketing and bashing them for doing their job. l did not find this appropriate and when I spoke out about this issue, one man and few of his supporters personally attacked me and used racist comments and called me ""a squirrel looking mofo"". After this they kicked me out of the group. I with they would let me back into the group. Ever since then I have not been able to keep up with the updates and yesterday my car got a boot.","#12436

Here I am trying to walk in the snow and slush from sky train to SFU surrey. They don't even have the small little walking area cleaned. Stop embarassing me in front of my boyfriend!
Also, it sucked that they decided to close campus at 5:30 when most of the evening classes have already started. close it earlier - when people haven't arrived. or just don't close if you suck so much. An hour of class in this struggle isn't worth it.","#12431

Honestly I think it's time as students that we start holding incompetent profs accountable. I took STAT 305 last fall and it was the single handed worst experience in my 4 years at SFU. The professor, who I will not name, did not teach anything, but even yelled at students who were confused in lecture. Not surprisingly, in a class of 500, only 50 were attending lecture by the end of the year. Worst thing is the same prof is still teaching the class, and I know there are other stories from students in similar classes. Why are we being forced to spend thousands of dollars on classes only to be forced to teach the material to ourselves. If a professor cannot properly teach a class the bad grades should fall on them and not the student cohort. End rant","#12419

As I ready myself to stand, I realize my knee is sticking to the leg of the table. As I peel it away, I feel my exposed leg hairs yoinked from my skin from the hole in my ripped jeans. Upon further inspection, I saw that some vile human being had freshly applied their slobber ridden gum to the leg of the table. Now, not only is it on the table, but it is stuck to my jeans AND caught in my leg hair! I had to spend the next twenty minutes scrubbing and pulling someone else's ABC gum from my hair and jeans while the smell of peppermint creeped its way into the back of my mind .

Since the start of this semester, I‚Äôve had a crush on this girl and she has a crush on me. This shit doesn‚Äôt only happen in movies, guys. The problem is, I still haven‚Äôt made a move to this day. Not because I‚Äôm shy. I know what to say. It‚Äôs because there‚Äôs no opportunity to talk.
It all started since day 1 of our tutorial. We just had similar interests when we introduced ourselves. That‚Äôs what made us cling. And then I also found her attractive. The reason why I think she likes me is because she keeps starring at me with a little smile. This has been happening for two months. Lectures included. And then when I make eye contact, she gets flustered and looks down. And literally the ONE time she wore makeup was the next time we met in tutorial after the first day. And she was giving me a glare. But I think I fucked up by doing that thing where you smile at a stranger on the street when you make eye contact by accident. Basically, I kinda showed I didn‚Äôt really care.
Here‚Äôs the problem. Idk if she‚Äôs playing hard to get or if she lost interest because I took too long to make a move. I still haven‚Äôt talked to her to this day. I mean we kind of did but I could actually count the amount of words we exchanged in total. Idk like 13? If you‚Äôre able to do that, then you BARELY talked at all.
I can‚Äôt even talk to her before tutorial because she‚Äôs always fucking late. And I can‚Äôt talk to her after because I have to leave right away for another class. I can‚Äôt talk to her during tutorial because she sits on the other side. I can‚Äôt talk to her in lectures because that‚Äôs too random for me to just suddenly start sitting with her.
FFS the semester is almost over. If it doesn‚Äôt work out, then I‚Äôll feel like I really lost something special.","#12414

I wish profs would be more prudent with managing a good classroom environment tbh. Especially in upper div courses where class sizes are comparable to those of high school classrooms, I really think more profs should take note when certain students pipe up too much or derail the discussion and talk with them separately about it. Everybody talks behind that kid's back and they'll never know what they're doing is not cool until it's too late and the rest of the lecture has tapped out.","#12413

In one of my 3 hour classes today, a student came in about 2 hours after the lecture started and asked to take photos of my notes during the lecture. I usually sit in the same seat each lecture and I have observed him come in during the last hour several times. It‚Äôs not hard to notice these trends after 10 weeks. It is fine if you want to come late to class but please do not think another stranger will just let you take photos of their neatly handwritten notes from most of the lecture.

IAT 233- take this course if you wanna to be forgotten by others.
IAT 233 is a VERY tough course that takes away your life. You won‚Äôt have time with friends and you won‚Äôt have time to sleep. You need to stay at school every day, from dawn to dusk, 24/7. You won‚Äôt have weekends off because you will need to work on group projects. Seriously, group project is on every single week and you only have 5 days to complete a ridiculous amount of work. The professor claimed that it‚Äôs supposed to be a 9 credit course, but the school gives us only 3. It looks like I‚Äôve never had fun with friends this semester.
If you‚Äôre taking IAT 233 next term, DO NOT get a skiing season pass because you won‚Äôt have the privilege to take weekends off. Be prepared to deal with mental related issues. Be prepared to be FORGOTTEN by your friends and people around you. ;‚Äô( (loney Christmas yo)

Think about the lifestyle habits of students around exams for a moment. Long hours awake, copious amounts of coffee and energy drinks, very little food, any food you eat is usually low in nutritional value. In the EMS industry, it's actually a standard teaching item - the overdosing (on caffeine) student during exams. That's not to say this is what happened to this patient, but it is something that happens to a lot of students. Please, take care of yourselves people. It's not worth your health. As this incident has demonstrated, security on campus will not respond in time, and the bystanders are unlikely to help. There is no ""safety net"" for you to rely on. Take care of yourself and minimize the likelihood of this happening to you.

As an SFU ""arts"" student finishing a Crim major and Psych minor, I think that the arts generally deserve every bit of criticism for being easy that they get. With that said, I don't think Crim can be included there. I can sleep through all of my Psych courses and get straight A's. Crim on the other hand is no joke. Not only do they mark 5% harder than any other art dept, the courses are fkn hard and anyone that gets out of here with the cGPA to go to law school still is an absolute animal.","#12393

I am starting to wonder whether parenting or manners class should be enforced at school. You can drop a fart threatening to mass murder a skytrain but that's fine since it's involuntarily. But why would anyone casually start CLIPPING THEIR NAILS and leave it on the skytrain floor!? Next thing you know, people will start pissing on the floor to mark their territory.
Bonus conspiracy theory: Spilled Tim Hortons cups are actually just that.","#12392

Two weeks ago, 2 classes were attacked by a student having a mental breakdown. I don't know what happened to him in his own class that triggered him, but I know that he punched a student in his own class before entering ours and throwing tables and chairs at people. SFU is doing nothing about it. They have not contacted any of us and are trying to cover the situation up. One girl had blood dripping down her face and a concussion and no one checked on her and she had to ride the bus home like that.
Our prof went to this violent student's class when we heard screaming. He told us to close and lock the doors but there are no locks on the doors at SFU!!!! Our prof also requested a counselor come to our class the following week to check up on us but instead what we got was damage control from some psychologist who was supposed to be head of SFU Health and Counselling and a security guard who basically told us this was no big deal, we were overreacting, and at one point they were victim blaming us!","#12385

This might be new for some people to hear but I really want to share my story.
I'm a 20 years old guy who have been facing some 'issues' from past 2 to 3 years. I consider myself as an asexual or gray ace person. For people who don‚Äôt know what asexual means, well it means that I have no sexual interest for any gender. It is not that I don‚Äôt find people hot. I do find a lot of Russian and Asian girls especially in SFU really hot but not in a sexual way. People might think I have no sexual encounter with someone yet that's why I'm feeling this but trust me I did think the exact same thing too when I was in all boys high school. I thought maybe I'll go to the university and will develop some feelings for girls. But there has been none till now. I was raised in a Muslim house old so I do follow certain guidelines that some stuff might not be allowed in our religion. You know that best feeling was knowing that asexual is not considered wrong at all in my religion. I really want to tell my parents now but I don‚Äôt know how to tell them.
I want to tell girls who I have a crush on but what will I say, ""Oh hey! I have a crush on you and I want to be in a relationship with you but mind you that I don't want to be romantically involved with you because I'm disgusted by sex"". I You see how horrible this sounds. I know relationships are not all about mating. But having no feelings for someone is so low feel. I don‚Äôt want people to see me as a freak. I just want to be normal. I just want to life a normal boy life. Where he finds a girl and gets married, have a family( or have dog) and be happy.
I indirectly asked my friends what they think about asexual people and they said ""Lol! They are sad people. They should just kill themselves. It sucks to be asexual. Where's the joy in life?""
And this breaks me to think that people who you want to support, will say things like this.","#12383

I've recently lost a six years friend from a car accident, it breaks my heart even thinking about losing her.
Before this, I took semesters off because I've been suffering from depression and anxiety. Basically I did some things, my doctor told me I wasn't ready for my regular life til recently. I came back to school this semester, not knowing anyone, and I feel difficult just standing in the crowd. I tried to get to know people, but I get so anxious just thinking about it, when I say Hi to classmates, I feel like I'm being looked at weird. I can't control this feeling, it's hard to ""feel normal"" again, I am afraid of meeting new people, asking questions, and I really hate that.
Sometimes I feel like nobody really gets me, like i'm just having one of those bad days but then it went on for more than a year already. I went ahead and found myself a part time job because I wanted to feel like I'm moving forward, but it's been difficult, job and school. On top of this losing my friend, I've been studying harder than ever because I want to work harder than I did before. I wanted to improve so she can be proud of me when she sees me from up there, I don't want to rot and give up on moving forward like I did before. It's just difficult doing this alone, I guess most people would say I'm just too weak or fragile. I think so too, maybe if I were stronger I wouldn't have caught all the negative feelings about myself and everything else.","#12370

The joke's on us, folks! Parking rates to increase.
Please be advised that at its meeting on June 28, 2018 the Board of Governors approved amendments to the following University policy:
The Parking, Mobility & Vehicle Traffic Policy AD1.03 is revised to:
Introduce varying Hourly/Daily rates between parking lots/areas on campus and an allowable price range for the Hourly/Daily parking rates to help manage parking supply and demand. This means:
1. The range for Hourly rates is from $3.25 to $5.00 per hour (rather than the former single $3.25/hr rate)
2. The range for the maximum daily rate is from $13.00 to $25.00 (rather than the former maximum daily rate of $13.00)
3. The Vice President Finance and Administration is authorized to: a) vary the Hourly/Daily rates in an Hourly parking lot within the above range and maximums and b) assign a parking rate to a newly created lot
Other minor editorial changes were approved to keep the language up-to-date.
The Board was informed, as required by the policy, of a change to the current parking citation (ticket) fines from $30 to $50.","#12364

tdlr; I'm dying of Ligma
I am an international engineering student and I can't shake the feeling of social isolation. Everday it seems to be the same shit, rinse and repeat. I don't have any friends and also kind of getting jaded with the usual tv series, movies or video games. It seems like I'm just living life day to day with a general direction in terms of academics or work, but a very hopeless personal life.
I came to Canada right after high-school and have worked pretty much by myself since then. Everything I've experienced, whether failure or success, has completely been mine and no one else's (except obviously, my parents), and I do take a certain pride in that. But because of that I always feel like I'm just stressing out from one thing to the next, and my reward isn't linear to the work I'm putting in.
I tried joining clubs and going to events, but majority of the time they're just not regular or it seems like everyone has their own group already. Even when I'm able to talk to everyone and seem to be enjoying myself and be comfortable, there's a certain amount of disconnect that I just can't overcome. You know, the kind where you don't have to worry about what the other person thinks because you understand. I suspect it maybe because, though my english is reasonably good, it is still my second language so I have to think about the sentence first before I speak it, or just maybe just my slight accent. It maybe neither, but the fact remains.
I hang with out with my acquaintances once or twice a semester whom I see just more often than others, which is mostly more formal than casual.
Generally, I try to avoid this self-pitying and focus my energy inwards. I work out as much and as intense as possible (upto the point of being sore everyday and sometimes risking injury), try to devote as much time to reading, listen to a lot of podcasts and study more intently and more often. This has actually helped me a lot and bode me a lot better than I could have ended up. But after 2-3 days, I'm faced again by, ""What am I doing this for?"". I wasn't super popular in high-school either, but definitely was blessed with few, but good and honest people as friends and family. But it seems here, I've lost that.
Right now, even though I can console myself on things getting better with time, I cannot ask myself how, because any statistic, logic or reason is hard to digest when you're the one living from dissapointment to dissapointment. I also cannot take time off because I really don't have anything else to do or look forward to back home either.
I mean, I don't claim to be severely depressed (atleast not that I know of), and definitely have good days too, but I just think living like this is not sustainable and will sooner or later get to my inevitable crash.","#12357

Imagine my shock when last Wednesday I was coming back from a trip downtown, when on campus an antisemitic man approached me. He was a big guy, for me. I was physically intimidated.

TL;DR saw a guy being a creep and aggressively persuade a possibly drunk or stoned girl to go somewhere with him, told transit authorities, hope the girl is okay. Girls gotta look out for one another!!!! While on my way to waterfront station from sfu downtown at around 7-7:30pm (so the station was still sort of busy and it was still daylight outside) I saw this couple in front of the station (a shortish white guy and a really tall black girl... she was wayyy out of his league btw) and the guy was touching her really aggressively like his hand was grabbing the back of her neck, trying to kiss her neck, holding her waist and I saw her stumble a few times (I think she have been might be drunk or stoned), she wasn‚Äôt really responsive to his actions and it looked like she was trying to go in the station but he kept pulling her away by her waist. After a while of debating whether I should interfere or not because I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were actually together or not (I couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying cuz I had earphones in and I didn‚Äôt want to get too close and look suspect) I couldn‚Äôt leave it and went to a skytrain attendant and told him about them and to watch our for them (hey better safe then sorry right?). At this point they walked into the station and the girl went to buy a ticket while the guy was next to her. The attendant said he‚Äôd notify the transit authorities and would keep an eye on them.

TL;DR saw a guy being a creep and aggressively persuade a possibly drunk or stoned girl to go somewhere with him, told transit authorities, hope the girl is okay. Girls gotta look out for one another!!!! While on my way to waterfront station from sfu downtown at around 7-7:30pm (so the station was still sort of busy and it was still daylight outside) I saw this couple in front of the station (a shortish white guy and a really tall black girl... she was wayyy out of his league btw) and the guy was touching her really aggressively like his hand was grabbing the back of her neck, trying to kiss her neck, holding her waist and I saw her stumble a few times (I think she have been might be drunk or stoned), she wasn‚Äôt really responsive to his actions and it looked like she was trying to go in the station but he kept pulling her away by her waist. After a while of debating whether I should interfere or not because I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were actually together or not (I couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying cuz I had earphones in and I didn‚Äôt want to get too close and look suspect) I couldn‚Äôt leave it and went to a skytrain attendant and told him about them and to watch our for them (hey better safe then sorry right?). At this point they walked into the station and the girl went to buy a ticket while the guy was next to her. The attendant said he‚Äôd notify the transit authorities and would keep an eye on them. I couldn‚Äôt stay long because I had someone waiting for me at another station but I really hope that girl is okay.

Being a couple who are both students... is very tough responsibility to bare. If both truly loves each other then both would compromise and communicate with each other to get through the slumbers of academia and balancing our debts and so forth.
However, what is heartbreaking is losing that girl of your dreams over the fact that one cannot balance three or more things at once. It haunts me every time as I thought she was the one. All I can do now is pray that she is ok with education, career and so forth. Its upsetting how one refuses to compromise.
As a result, I now feel that I am unworthy of having a girl in my life. What has this generation come to? Is there still a place for an old soul like me?","#12350

Hi, I know there are a lot of depressing confessions here but I can't help myself. I don't know what I think, feel or want anymore. It's a vicious cycle, I feel hopeful for a few days when not in depressive episodes. At the same time, anxiety takes over when depression is not around. Then I get depressed because I'm too anxious. Then I fall into the pithole again, it's a safe bubble where I don't have to think. I have tried counseling and seeing a doctor but I quit. I have no hope for future me. The only thing holding me back is pain and not wanting to hurt my family. They've been so sweet and did nothing to deserve someone like me. Now, I think ending my life is the only rational decision but I'm not gonna do it anytime soon. But I'm preparing myself for it. I started being more open to people around me about this topic. I'm not embarrassed or ashamed of it even though it prevents me from being a normal functional human being. I started thinking about signing up as an organ donor after I pass away. I started drafting suicide notes. I'm so tired to sailing through this life, even breathing is so painful, I don't know if I wanna get better. So people who are going through the same thing, please never feel guilty about what and how you feel, you've done your best to make it this far. I don't believe in myself but I believe you'll be ok, whoever is reading this. I'm open to reaching out or being reached out to, if you want.","#12346

These two continue to talk and the dude is just giving her his life story, like I mean I know his full name spelt out, his gf's name spelled out, the amount of step moms he's had, his cats name, what his family does for work, his finances, his SIN, his credit card #... ok maybe not the last 3 but given enough time it probably would have come out. At about Braid station this guy says he's a TA and I was in shock that someone with this little concern for their privacy or concern for how blatantly loud they talk could be a TA, especially at SFU (please don't let me get stuck in his tutorial).

About a month ago, I lost a few of my closest friends. Normally I‚Äôd brush it off real quick; but because we were a little bit too close, it was real tough to get over with. The next thing I know, nobody is left with me. I drifted away with everyone all at the same time, even my non-close friends. I lost faith in humanity and isolated myself from the rest of the world. I deleted all my old social media accounts and changed my number so nobody can contact me (I usually don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ but this time, for some reason, it hit me real hard.). When I realized that I really did have no one, I felt so much emptiness inside and yeah, I realized that I really had been dependent on people. I really don‚Äôt know who I can trust now, or where I can go to make friends, especially in SFU. There is literally no way of interacting with people unless you join a club or be a big party animal. I‚Äôm not that social, I‚Äôm an introvert and shy around other people, not as funny as some of you, not as optimistic as a lot of you. I keep thinking to myself that if I do a slightest thing wrong, people are going to run away from me again. I have a broken background followed by an extremely low self-esteem, and as I was scrolling down the Instagram timeline, I began comparing myself with them and became more hateful about how shy I was around other people. I began to develop a thought that I am not worthy of making any friends because of how negative I was becoming.

After knowing my parents for 20 years, ive come to the conclusion that I love my parents but I don't like them. Yes it's possible. I love my parents for who they are: they're ambitious, hard working and have great senses of humour. But I don't like how they are as parents. They're not understanding, and they make all the big decisions of my life. They control my money even tho I work 2 jobs and contribute financially at home. They expect me to go to school, MAINTAIN my scholarship, work 2 jobs, tutor my siblings, volunteer, look good AND help out with chores all while having a huge smile on my face. My dad is the most useless person in our household who works 10 hours a day and spends the next 14 hours complaining about how he just worked 10 hours. My mom is currently going through depression due to some family issues on her side of the family and I'm pretty sure they're both bipolar. The only normal person in my family is my sister. I wish I could adopt her and run away from here.

I really messed up my friendship with a girl, even though we liked each other. Sometimes I still think back and wonder if there's anything I could have done differently. We both didn't really know very many people at school, and I guess we were kinda grouped together by chance. I was fairly shy, but she didn't seem to mind.
Our personalities weren't exactly a match made in heaven, but as the semester went on, I grew to liking her company, and really enjoyed the time we spent eating together, studying together, and taking random walks in the sun.
The semester drew to a close, but I was too shy to ask her out. I wasn't really good at flirting, and didn't know how to respond when she made the occasional flirty or loving comment. To be honest, I guess I really just wasn't ready for dating at the time. The semester ended. She never spoke to me again for months. For a long time, I'd wanted to be more social and become a less shy person, and I guess this finally made me unhappy enough with the way things are and gave me the shove to get out of my comfort zone instead of accepting the status quo.
We both have our own friend groups now, and I've come to terms with myself. I wonder if she's forgotten about it.. I still wish it didn't have to turn out this way. We talk to each other occasionally again, but it reminds me of how things will never be as simple as they used to be.","#12339

""If a female matrix F has determinant zero then any male input vector is an eigenvector of itself for all Œª > 1"" like wtf dude), and a group of hippies that call themselves pioneers in number theory because ""they have what it takes to prove the Riemann hypothesis"". I regret taking MATH but I'm pretty sure it's too late to switch when I literally have not taken any other course than maths. I like to tell people that I chose math but let‚Äôs be real here, math is essentially people who were too lazy to think it through before applying to uni, and too dumb for Compsci or actual useful majors. Math is so useless that once someone unplugs my MATLAB i die because i don't know how to do anything else.","#12333

I honestly don't understand the need for tutors. If you're old enough or physically capable to go to university, you stand the same chance that everyone else in the course does to pass/do well at it. What it shows is that at your big age, you can't be studying on your own and consequently need outside help. Nobody's born a genius so if you're struggling in a class because of a bad prof then someone else is too. Tutors provide a nice little escape route to students with the financial advantage and end up giving these ""wealthy"" students an upper hand over students that can't afford that same tutor. I understand the concept of ""if you have money, use it"" but at the same time, it's not gonna help you in the long run.","#12332

So in the years of going to SFU Burnaby Campus I have noticed that there seems to be quite a few scammers going around. My first experience with them was the ""Deaf and Mute"" Donation one in which they bug students around both the library and common areas with bogus books on sign language hoping for distracted and ignorant people to give them free money. The second I have seen and also fallen for is where a Filipino lady purporting to get signatures and donations for poor children in the Philippines also goes around the library and common areas, and where I was caught off guard by it was at a food place at Cornerstone. Lastly and very recently I ran into a ""White Van"" type of scam in the East Parking lot at noon. Being the busiest parking time, I assumed the driver was going to ask me for a parking spot since I was leaving, but instead tried the whole ""Buy this normally $2000 speaker for only $500 scam on me, by pretending he needed to get rid of it before going to work, or his boss was going to get mad at him.","#12331

I wanted to play a bit so I called one of the girls (ofc not her) and told her that he wants to tell them that he is gay and he's afraid if his friends will accept him. She told me that she will make sure that he knows that everyone loves him no matter his sexual orientation.

I never understood why people always shit on rich kids for showing off. If I were rich I would show off like anything. I would literally buy a Louis Vuitton case for my fricken iclicker, That's how extra I would be. I always see people making fun of rich kids (esp international ones) for wearing YSL supreme and Canada goose but why!?? If they can afford it why wouldn't they wear it?! I mean Their last minute first class ticket home costs more that my tuition this semester...
I'm thankful My parents always gave me whatever they could and even today while barely making ends meet my mom still says if we were rich she would make sure I was dressed head to toe in branded clothes. She even says if we were rich she wouldn't even care if i went to school or not. I guess that's just a dream of hers. It makes a lot of parents proud that they can bring happiness to their kids through branded clothes and accessories. There's no need to hate.","#12307

I am one of the students of Beedie School of Business and you as well. I have not understood why a great deal of students in Business major are called ‚ÄòSNAKES‚Äô, but now I can see why.
You are speaking ill of the other students in different majors that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a job after graduation just because they are not in Beedie and you continue to pretend that you are worthier than others just because you are in Beedie, showing your great desire to be an excelled person. I don‚Äôt know what it means to you, but I know for certain that it‚Äôs not right to look others down just because your GPA is slightly higher than theirs. You're not an elite, you‚Äôve pretended to be an elite. Lower GPA than you isn‚Äôt the specific evidence that you're superior to them. PLEASE DON‚ÄôT ASK OTHERS WHETHER THEY GOT HIGHER GPA THAN YOU OR NOT. THAT‚ÄôS RUDE. Furthermore, as a result of observing you all day, you are playing a cell phone game throughout the whole day and you whine that there are tons of assignments to do. I‚Äôve tried to understand you as much as I can, but there is a definite reason for people to leave you one by one. As a person who knows u well, I would like you to be a person who can clearly see the right and wrong of your actions before you lose every single person surrounding you.
Lastly, YOUR GPA IS EVEN LOWER THAN MINE LMFAO, STOP BEING FUKCIN' RUDE.","#12304

I don't know how being busy will excuse someone from doing their job... Yes, we are all scrambling doing the end of the semester, but that didn't stop me from handing in my assignments, and it definitely did not stop the profs from delivering lectures every week.
So I don't see how it is okay to make it reasonable for a TA to be so constantly late that it could be counted by week in responding to emails and returning weekly based assignments.
Don't they get paid to do the job? With OUR tuition money? I don't expect TAs to be genuinely caring for all of their students and passionate all the time, but at least get the job done, and don't abuse the power like they've never had any before.
Sorry, that is the end of my rant. Good luck everyone in your finals, and hopefully we all get awesome TAs in the future.","#12293

I have a combination of great respect, disbelief and curiosity for people who major in and/or enjoy doing mathematics. The curiosity stemming from my wondering of how anyone could enjoy learning about integrals, matrices and whatnot for years. I know every individual is wired differently, but personally, if I had to even take one more calculus class than what is already required in my program, I'd off myself. And yes, I have a calc final coming up soon lol.","#12291

Yesterday, I went to Renaissance to get some coffee. In the line up, I saw a cute girl from one of my classes who I‚Äôd been working up the nerve to ask out. I thought now would be a good time. I started talking to her, but I was feeling super nervous. We ended up getting our stuff and she waved bye at me. I still hadn‚Äôt asked her, so I tried to stall for time. I went up to her and asked her where she was going. She said library and I said me too, thinking I‚Äôll ask her on the way. I think that combined with my nervousness weirded her out because her tone and body language became closed off. Instead of asking her, I ended up following her like a lost puppy. She said she‚Äôs actually going somewhere else instead and asked me where I was going. By her tone, I knew I had no chance and had to abort. I said upstairs and awkwardly said bye. It‚Äôs crazy how much nervousness can impair you.","#12289

Dear SFU Men,
I‚Äôm sick and tired of having to clean the toilet seat before using it. I am very considerate about hygiene and cleanliness when it comes to using the restroom. If you can not be decent enough to sit down and pee, use the fucking urinals that are built for you people so that you do not have to put your lazy ass on the toilet to pee. We, as a community, keep talking about hygiene and behave as a community with cleanliness but when it comes to using the restrooms, we pee all over toilets seats which is fucking insane. I‚Äôm so tired and frustrated. Pls sit and pee. Live and let live.

You know what's great? Being backstabbed by someone that you extended an olive branch to. So there was this guy who had a lot of rumors surrounding him and people would constantly talked shit about him. I thought that defamation wasn't cool so I reached out and tried to connect with this individual to get to the bottom of the truth. Eventually we became pretty good friends, but then one day something suddenly changed, this person met someone else. I was acquaintances with this second person too but eventually I felt like I was being shunned. Later I found that these two individuals were talking shit about me and spreading stuff within their circle which honestly really stung.
You reach out to someone you thought was being unjustly wronged and take a stand with them only to get stabbed in the back and for them to the same thing to you that others were doing to them.
It really puts a bad taste in my mouth, I feel like if I see someone in hardship, I should just let them rot because they'll just take advantage of me and then ghost me when I'm not useful any longer.
I know that not everyone is bad, but things like this really make me not want to be empathetic towards others.","#12273

His death is in mystery even now but he saw, how he was killed by arrow shot in the left side of his neck. And apparently Tut-ankh-amen‚Äôs after life person exists in Japan and the guy touches his left side of his neck for some reasons. I‚Äôll skip the amazing ability he applied to my sister here cuz it‚Äôs kinda private stuff. Anyways, my sister asked him what‚Äôs the cause of my mom‚Äôs sickness and what we can do to support her. And he explained to her that my mom needs to be thanked more by people and she just needs pure positive support from us and we shouldn‚Äôt worry about her. Cuz apparently the negative thinking would worsen her health condition. I really do think it is 100% right thing to do and that is what we need to do for our mom.
Before the meeting happened, I had chance to tell my sister that I wanna know how to be good friends again with my ex girlfriend. (She broke up with me and she‚Äôs probably with another man right now. I don‚Äôt have the feeling for her now, but I really want to be back to close friends again) Well...in the meeting guess what he said...hahahahaha Still can‚Äôt stop laughing! It was so funny when my sister told me that he said ‚ÄúThink by yourself‚Äù LOLOL Yeah, I know that is probably the best answer! But it was too disappointing and I was so not expecting it to hear from such a special human LOLOL","#12268

So I have developed a really bad habit where I cannot stay in my room without being completely and stark naked.

I also am more focused and more productive working in this manner too. So this week, without a care in the world, I have had to submit a photo of one of assignments and since I was so used to it didn't click in my mind that the ""old fella down there"" was peeking at the corner of the photo.

So before I got hired and during my Co-op site visit, my co-op adviser kept beating me over the head with the fact that my position is soooooo wonderful, and how so many people have bloomed under the supervisor. They also said that this position would be a great catalyst for positions in the future and after graduation.
The co-op adviser had zero proof to back up these claims so I decided to do some detective work and find out for myself. So I fired up the ol' LinkedIn and searched for my position and company and found people dating all the way back to 2006. A number of them worked for or are now working for some pretty big and reputable companies. Anyways, so I hit them up and asked them if I could ask them some questions about their time there.
I began with the basic stuff about what their thoughts were and the experience they gained with the position, a number of them had a negative perception. Eventually, I got to talking about how my current position helped them if at all secure positions elsewhere down the road. And unsurprisingly, they all said that the position didn't help them at all. And that they landed those position because of projects that they worked on during school or extracurricular activities.
So are individuals with first-hand experience in the position lying or is it the co-op adviser spewing out bullshit to further their agenda? This is clearly blatant lies and could be considered false advertisement.
In summary, don't be like me, don't trust the smiling co-op advisers, they have their own goals and don't really give a damn about the students they are supposed to serve. Someone commented on another co-op confession recently saying that most of the staff at SFU is aligned with the goals of the co-op staff all the way up to and maybe even including the ombudsperson.
Take everything with a grain of salt my friends and trust no one.","#12257

I never met his friends because he never wanted me to and my friends told me to leave but I just couldn't because of the strong feelings I had. From the bottom of my heart I really loved him. I trusted this person with my life and he gave me false promises of getting engaged, travelling together, and spending our lives together. One thing was I felt I was never a priority because He would never see me but once or twice a month. I would always cook for him, talk to him and just wanted to be there for him. He never spent major holidays with me and I feel extremely hurt and played. Knowing the fact I wasn't worth it for him I should've left sooner. I am very fortunate people are me have supported me but I just others who are going through a hard time that love is worth fighting for if it's not one sided.

One thing was I felt I was never a priority because He would never see me but once or twice a month. I would always cook for him, talk to him and just wanted to be there for him. He never spent major holidays with me and I feel extremely hurt and played. Knowing the fact I wasn't worth it for him I should've left sooner. I am very fortunate people are me have supported me but I just others who are going through a hard time that love is worth fighting for if it's not one sided.

My TA's really disorganized leading the tutorials. We're supposed to go over the readings, complete weekly presentations. Yes, the majority don't prefer to be actively involved in discussions, but that atmosphere got worse since TA's behaviors.
TA doesn't come to the tutorials prepared with discussion questions or notes. TA just simply asks how was the class and do not mention about any relations to the readings. It's not like I want the TA to tell us the summary of readings, but TA doesn't seem to care at all. And the worst part is, TA once walked out of the class to pick up the phone during the presentation and was late for tutorial dealing with his phone.
I just feel like my time is wasted and maybe that's why at least half of the tutorial are not attending it. I wonder if there's any other way than evaluation form we submit by the end of the term to fix this problem.","#12248

I was rushing through traffic one day because I was running late,
I had a midterm that morning so you can imagine I was in a panicked state.
I was frantically looking for parking spots left and right,
I saw you waiting for a car to leave, and decided to put up a fight.
I speed all the way to the spot right in time,
I knew that what I was doing was some sort of crime.
As I took your spot I felt guilty but proud,
But what you are your friend did next was obnoxious and loud.
You honked your horn and flipped me the bird,
As a response I decided to stoop down to your level and also be a turd.
I was low key offended, so I flipped you the bird back,
I thought to myself back then, what a brilliant counterattack.
Now that I am mature and old,
I thought it was necessary for this story to be told.
There is an important lesson to be learned from my crime,
Just kidding...this was a total waste of time.

td;dr - I was sexually harassed in a workplace and the CEO turned a blind eye, now he's being celebrated by my student union and faculty. Should I say something?
I was sexually harassed by a coworker in a workplace that I have since then left. The CEO of the company called me into the office and I was told that it was my fault and that I should cover up. I wrote an extensive report to the co-op office, but nothing was done. The CEO was recently invited as a guest to an SFU event organized by my student union.
That co-op experience was my first work term and it was the worst job I've ever had. I've lost complete confidence in the coop office and in my student union.

I had previously expressed some concerns with the position and I subliminally led on that I felt that I was misled into taking the position by my advisor. So my advisor spent a good half an hour with my manager and I could hear them both having a good laugh from down the hall. I eavesdropped for a bit and he did not bring up any of my concerns.
Then he came by to visit me. He started telling me how great I‚Äôm doing and what a wonderful opportunity this is, straight up psychological warfare even though he knew where I stood. Bitch tried really hard to make me think that this place was great. I just sort of played along, nodding and giving him a big ol smile. Just because my manager is happy with me doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm getting anything out of the job. I have gained zero meaning experience from my co-op at the halfway point. Eventually, he said that he was trying but he wasn‚Äôt getting any ques from me, wtf does that even mean? Do you want me to dance for you? He was like I‚Äôm your advisor, you are supposed to let loose and rant to me. Bitch, the last time I ranted, you had an answer for everything and did not give a shit about what I wanted. You thwarted all my concerns.
So then he became all passive aggressive and was like I don‚Äôt need a performance from you and that my behaviour with him showed that I was a weak candidate and that I couldn‚Äôt endure a placement or commit to something. He turned it all on me. Bitch I had concerns with the position from the beginning when I was offered the job and you fucking lied to me to fulfil your quota.
He also kept emphasizing the fact that this co-op would be a catalyst for other positions, like previous co-ops had ended up working at big companies like PwC and EY. Where is the evidence that this co-op placement helped those people get those jobs? Is there direct causation? NO! There isn‚Äôt any and that is all horseshit.

It's really boring up here sometimes. Not because I don't have friends, but because we've already done everything there is to do here so many times. Can SFU please get an ice rink? With the SFSS elections coming up, I'll vote for who ever is down to build us an ice rink. While ""advocacy"" and free food give-aways are nice, I'd be willing to accept less of it if it meant we could have an ice rink! Seriously, our school is on top of a mountain in Canada and WE DON'T HAVE AN ICE RINK? We need one ASAP. An ice rink+ a gondola would make this place so much better!","#12229

I‚Äôve been having really bad stomachache these days because of the stress from breaking up. Anyways.. I got dumped by my boyfriend all of a sudden when I wasn‚Äôt expecting at all for it. Tbh, I was in a toxic relationship where I was too addicted to him and not able to have interests in what‚Äôs around me. I couldn‚Äôt help but to get jealous when he‚Äôs having so much fun with other people simply because I couldn‚Äôt make him happy like they did. i just wanted his attention that‚Äôs all. Anyways, that was one of the reasons why he left me. Shockingly, he even told me it‚Äôs not fun being with me because of my seriousness. Nothing shocked me more than the sudden break up where I thought ‚Äúwe were doing just fine‚Äù tho. Because I sincerely loved him, my heart was broken and I cried like a little bitch 2 consecutive nights and mornings. At first, the heartless attitude of him and how he suddenly wants nothing to do with me made me angry and hate him. He seemed to be like the person who only remember bad memories while I‚Äôm like the polar opposite. It was really tough when I knew he really doesn‚Äôt give a shit about me because I just couldn‚Äôt forget about the happy memories we made together.
I was desperate to find something that can distract my mind from thinking about my ex. I made new female friends but it didn‚Äôt help to get him off of my head. Few days later, luckily I came to have intimate relationship with ‚ÄúW‚Äù thinking this is just a temporary thing until I get over with this break up. And it really helped me being alive and not thinking about the ex, even just temporarily. I was ashamed of having this kind of habit at first but I came to think ‚Äúfk it, I love doing this‚Äù. It‚Äôs not as bad as how some people consider. From my experience, eating with ‚ÄúW‚Äù make me taste the food 5 times more delicious than the usual. Also ‚ÄúW‚Äù taught me to listen to so deep into music and amuse my brain cells like I have never ever imagined. The best part is, it wouldn‚Äôt be a too addictive relationship. I can‚Äôt say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not addictive‚Äù because I make use of it regularly and haven‚Äôt thought of stop doing it yet. I still need to keep doing it because of the depression I sometimes get.
Even tho I still can‚Äôt understand how he can ditch me like this but now I have no hate at all now because of ‚ÄúW‚Äù. Honestly, I really thank my ex for being with me over the years. Back when I just came to Canada and had no friends he talked to me every day. He saved me from loneliness and taught me new fun stuff to do here in Canada. I truly wish he would make the right girlfriend for him someday and live happily ever after.
Few days after the breakup I luckily met ‚ÄúW‚Äù who supported me to live without my ex, to eat well and to be active. I had no appetite after breaking up and lost few pounds but you saved me from starving stomach. When I was too depressed to get out of bed, you encouraged me to go to gym and work out till I worn out. Thank you, weed.
PS; Playing guitar is added to my new hobby thanks to you, weed.","#12228

Apparently some people are not aware of that?? Or maybe they are and they don‚Äôt think it matters too much.

So I‚Äôve got a situation... I was hanging out with my best guy friend who‚Äôs recently been through a break up of a long term relationship. It‚Äôs only been a few weeks since their break up and I was trying to suggest ways to get over the relationship/move on (suggesting asking that really nice cute girl in his lecture out or maybe make a tinder account but he was pretty adamant about not wanting to create one) after a while.
But when we were playing card he sprung the question I dreaded. He asked me if I wanted to try dating, as in, each other. I never liked him any other way except platonically but I knew he sorta had feelings for me at one point. I played it off by saying it would have been weird cuz I see him like a brother and his ex also thought there was something going on between us at times when they were together and there never was (at least on my part) and i didn‚Äôt want her to think that there was anything going on behind her back when they were together.
But he was like ‚Äúwould it really be that weird though? It‚Äôd just be like hangout like we normally do.‚Äù And I said it definitely would be because there the romantic/non-platonic aspect of the relationship. It was an awkward car ride when he dropped me home and after he texted me apologizing for springing the question on me and said he thought it would keep his mind off his break up. I didn‚Äôt really buy that thought because he was hesitating for quite a bit before asking the question.
He‚Äôs my best guy friend and I don‚Äôt want anything to change in our friendship. We‚Äôve known each other since the beginning of high school. I‚Äôve been kinda worried about hanging out with him again in a few days with friends(they don‚Äôt know anything about this, not even his break up). I low-key also feel kinda offended that he thought I‚Äôd be okay with being a rebound after just a few weeks.
TL;DR my best friend broke up with his long term gf and when we were hanging out he asked me if I wanted to try dating him.","#12225

SFU is very racist when it comes to enrolment. They prioritize those high gpa students by giving them early enrolment dates. By the time students like me (who have relatively low gpa) start to enrol, all the good classes are closed. Many of us end up choosing difficult classes and it somehow drives our gpa further down. Then SFU has excuses to keep us in school for many more semesters.
I know that those smart students need to graduate, so do we (not so smart students üòû)
I hope those newly elected Board of Governors and Senates (which many of them I voted for) should work on this. You guys should make our experiences at SFU more memorable and smooth.","#12224

So I got this new fancy job as a work term and in my first week, they put me in charge of ordering some new copiers. These things cost like 18k a piece and I'm just this brand new short-term student trying to gain some experience because we all know that if we don't get any relevant experience were essentially fucked after graduation. So anyway, I'm getting quotes from the printer company and to my surprise, printing is actually crazy insane cheap. I mean we are talking $0.0065/copy for black and white and $0.04/copy for colour. Seriously!??!?! Why did this shock and amaze me you ask? Well, this bewildered the unicorn shit breath out of me because I am an SFU student and we SFU students pay 11 cents per copy and 30 cents for colour. Just a casual 1500% mark up (give or take (don't judge my math)). Now I happen to also know what SFU likely pays for the printers themselves because I'm just going to assume its in the ballpark of what my company pays so let's say they lease the printers on 60 month contracts that include service and are charged the low printing costs that I mentioned above. This is probably around $150/month give or take, for the big boys, smaller ones are less, roughly $40-$60 a month. My company runs an average of 12,000 pages per month for 51 people. So SFU probably runs a metric fuck ton for 30,000 people. so one metric fuck ton X $0.11 = more money than you'll ever make in your first 5 years post grad (mainly because we will all be sad servers with no experience). Oh and just if you wanted to know, my company printing costs are about $300/month on average. SFU is likely pulling in thousands of dollars from us per month all in profits.
Some of you may now be thinking, ""hey OP, what about paper?"", well, I think about that too. a box of 500 sheets costs like $20 or something like that. It doesn't even come close to cutting away at their profits. So the take away from this is: You're fucked either way and there is nothing you can do about it! GOOD DAY!!!!","#12202

This is one of the hardest things I have ever had to write, but it‚Äôs something that I need to get off of my chest.
I am a fourth year, SFU Beedie student who just wants to succeed in this life. Who wants to make it somewhere, who knows he has so much to give to this world, to its people and wants to have his full potential realized, without constantly being limited by obstacles. More than anything, he wants this so bad, so that he can give it all back to his family who has given him the world, but is often left in the dark about the pain he goes through.
I have tremendous ambition, high expectations for myself, am a perfectionist to a fault. I have been called ""extremely talented"", been told that I am ‚Äúgoing to make it somewhere‚Äù, that I will ‚Äúdo great things‚Äù, I am ‚Äúspecial‚Äù. Such a great perception of me right? And yes, it is great, when I can uphold that image. But, when I can go from feeling like someone that can conquer the world, can do and accomplish anything, to someone that feels completely worthless, that is when all of that gets minimized. When my pain and obstacles become the best of me, I feel like a different person. I think, or I know that others notice as well.
Anxiety, ADHD, depression, physical and chronic pain are words that have been thrown around to describe what I go through, my ‚Äúpain‚Äù, my ""obstacles"". I try not to live in labels, but it provides for the quickest way for people to understand. These, let‚Äôs call them barriers, affect me mentally and physically. At my worst, they assassinate my intelligence, immobilize my confidence, turning me from a charismatic, charming, fun-loving and social person, to someone that just wants to be alone and pathetically wallow in his sadness. I can go from impressing people to disappointing them in the blink of an eye. I can go from being ridiculously productive, amazingly articulate, and poetically eloquent, to someone that feels mentally and physically paralyzed, reduced to sitting alone on his bed or couch, contemplating his always inevitable and cyclical failure. I want to be so successful. I want to contribute to society and make a difference. I want to kill it in this life. And I really feel like I can sometimes. Other times, I just feel like this life will kill me, one day.
I know it‚Äôs not cancer or a broken limb, and I understand I live in a privileged society where I should be able to do anything my mind wants - so for all those quick to call me lazy, or dismiss what I‚Äôm going through, please don‚Äôt. I do that to myself enough. I don‚Äôt want to be like this. I already recognize that so much of this is self-induced. It fucking feels like self-sabotage god damn it. Some of you may say, ‚Äújust do it‚Äù, or keep moving! And you know what, sometimes it really works! But, how do you keep moving, when every fiber in your body and every thought in your mind tries to hold you back?
I have spent the last 2 years of my life on this journey to self-awareness, to healing, to becoming a bigger and better person. I‚Äôve put myself through counseling, been apart of groups, all to obtain the knowledge, understanding, and resources that I need to be in a better place. And what‚Äôs funny, is sometimes I am in that place! Damn it, it was just a week and a half ago where I felt so amazing. And yet, I can fall just as fast, reduced to looking outside my window as I write this, wondering ‚Äúwhat is wrong with me?‚Äù.
I know I am not the only one that goes through this. This post was not written to elicit pity and patronage from my fellow peers. This is me being vulnerable. And honestly, it feels a little pathetic. How terrible is it that I can‚Äôt even tell my closest friends and family about this? And it‚Äôs not their fault. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to burden them. I see the world Snapchatting and Instagramming all of their happiness, and it makes me realize, no one really wants to hear about my problems. We all tell ourselves, as to how the conversation needs to change, how we all need to be more open. But do we? Hell no! Because we‚Äôre petrified about people seeing as anything less than perfect‚Ä¶ So we emotionally numb ourselves, hide our darkness, and smile, lying through our teeth.
But to those that know how this feels, that don‚Äôt care about the status quo and the taboos, just tell me, please, it gets better right?","#12197

So I‚Äôm taking a shower in the changeroom, and I take my valuables with me, but leave my clothes on the bench, because who steals those when your underwear is on top of them? I come back from my shower and my underwear is gone. Stolen. Everything else is still there except for my underwear.

With all these posters about the school senate elections, I feel like no one is addressing the issue that's actually really important. The monopoly that SFU catering has. Their menu is incredibly overpriced and their food is actually awful quality. 21$ of your SFSS fees go towards buying a pizza that looks like this when you go to a club event. That's a chicken pizza by the way that we got for a club event. What's worse is that SFU catering automatically charges a gratuity fee too. I guess SFU wants to make a boat load of money of SFU catering too.","#12195

As I finished studying for my midterm, I realized how incompetent my professor is.
The slides are riddled with errors. And students have pointed them out in class too. The professor just says ""Oh you're right, that's an error.""... The thing is, they admit theyve been teaching this course for many years and using the same slides. Well why don't you update them, you lazy slob?
In addition, throughout my undergraduate degree, I've had professors that are utterly unfit to teach their given course.
How the hell do SFU (and other universities) get away with having so many subpar instructors?","#12192

So my coop sucks. I spent most of my time in isolation sitting at my desk completing tasks assigned to me by my supervisor. When I got the offer in November, I consulted my co-op advisor about concerns that I had. I asked him if there was I would be in a mentor-mentee relationship as I wanted to get industry experience directly from the source. He assured me that the supervisor I'd be working for has profound feedback and that it'd be a great position.
Fast forward to February, there has been zero semblance of mentorship or feedback. My supervisor stays in his office and we barely communicate. I feel like he gets annoyed if I approach him. He always replies with one word answers when I ask him anything. I'm learning nothing at this place, not regarding my field, or regarding professionalism. The thing that sucks the most is that the coop is 2 semesters long but I don't wanna be here for the second semester. I emailed my advisor and he said that there isn't anything that can be done as I signed up for 2 semesters. And he also added that I needed to suck it up and deal with it. I felt rather betrayed by him, just fulfilling his quota to get paid, and not giving a shit about the students he serves.
So now either I can stay at a place where I don't want to be until September or do something about it. The site visit is coming up in March so I'm not sure if I should tell the advisor that everything is fine or if I want out. If I say I want out, he'll just tell me to deal with it. The other option is to manually quit, tell the manager I resign. In that case I risk losing a reference at the end. But idk how much that's worth anyway.
I'm not sure what I should do and it's really killing me inside. People get such great coops where they get experiences of their lives and make meaningful connections whilst I'm here rotting in isolation being used as cheap labour.","#12182

Ever meet someone who is basically a carbon copy of another one of your friends? It can be different things ‚Äì sometimes they look the same, sometimes they act the same, sometimes it‚Äôs the same personality. It‚Äôs like talking to one of them constantly makes you think ‚Äúoh ya, they talk/act/gesture just like‚Ä¶‚Äù. Well this past semester I met someone who carries themselves a lot like one of my friends. It‚Äôs in the hand gestures and the stance ‚Äì it‚Äôs basically identical. I noticed it one day when we were hanging out and he was telling a story and the hand gestures he used, the angle he held his head, it was a dead ringer. Which is ironic, I guess. Since the friend he reminds me of is dead.

Ever meet someone who is basically a carbon copy of another one of your friends? It can be different things ‚Äì sometimes they look the same, sometimes they act the same, sometimes it‚Äôs the same personality. It‚Äôs like talking to one of them constantly makes you think ‚Äúoh ya, they talk/act/gesture just like‚Ä¶‚Äù. Well this past semester I met someone who carries themselves a lot like one of my friends. It‚Äôs in the hand gestures and the stance ‚Äì it‚Äôs basically identical. I noticed it one day when we were hanging out and he was telling a story and the hand gestures he used, the angle he held his head, it was a dead ringer. Which is ironic, I guess. Since the friend he reminds me of is dead.

Men of the SFU changeroom: it would be great if some of you could stop saturating yourselves with Axe body spray, AKA female repellent. If the gas cloud from your extended full-body spraying has reached such a high concentration in the surrounding air that it is about to condense back into a liquid on surrounding surfaces, something is wrong. If surrounding people are choking for air, or are promptly leaving your immediate area, you might have used a little bit too much. I thought body spray went out with the early 2000's, but it seems to be experiencing a resurgence in the SFU changeroom.","#12175

I don't know, I just feel so hesitant to get into a new relationship even though it's been a while since my last girlfriend. The reason I tell myself that I shouldn't dive into another relationship is because I got so much going on in my life, juggling school and work basically everyday but I think the real reason is I'm afraid of building something where I'm fully invested in that significant other for them not to reciprocate the same feelings and that torches me inside, I'm 21 now, I know I know, ""you're still young"" I get that but I'm not the type of guy to just date around casually and have relationships that last a couple months. I'm in for the long haul and want to build a solid foundation with someone I hope to someday spend the rest of my life with and have kids with and just have a best friend for life. I'm scared of opening myself up again and feeling vulnerable with someone, and it sucks because I find vulnerability so beautiful, when you get to share your most intimate feelings with each other and just be judgement free. I miss all of that, I miss the emotions and the physical nature of a relationship because it's truly just an amazing experience. I've worked so hard to really look at myself in the mirror and identify the flaws I had in my last relationship and so I worked on myself, mentally and physically and I feel great and feel like I'm ready to just be with someone to create endless memories with and sometimes I feel afraid to get hurt all over again. To the girl that's going to be my next, you will be the last as well because I'm all yours.","#12173

My entire youth life I have been dealing with OCD and have developed obsessive habits because of the intrusive thoughts but when I hear someone say that they are so OCD if something is out of alignment, I begin to think that they don't know the horror's of living with this disorder. I have found ways to combat my OCD through my everyday life which is constantly doing something so my mind does not wander but that strategy derails when I hear someone says I am so OCD and I go back to my obsessive thought process because I am reminded of it. I understand that sometime's it slips up but I just want people to know more rather than the surface of it and sometimes it can trigger people really badly when all they want to do is escape the thoughts that have taken over their life at one point or another.","#12170

I've posted many times on here about being lonely but I guess I'm getting used to it because real life is not easy. It's well known that social life at sfu is not that great and I know a lot of people will comment on here about joining clubs, etc. I have tried joining clubs, but they are very inactive for the most part or I never know when things are going on. You meet people but you rarely see them again no matter how hard you try to initiate some sort of outing. I am still to this day trying hard to get a social life here and a lot of people say you came to SFU to study but good friends are important. I haven't had much luck with friends here maybe its just me I have tried getting out of my comfort zone but it does not seem to be working. It's little things like seeing someone in a relationship or just people going out. I want to be out having fun but some people are satisfied with living a plain life of not doing anything. It's good for them, different people have different wants but I just want to meet people who want to explore like me and maybe even find a potential partner. I study a lot but sometimes on a friday night i want to be out doing something. Maybe it's just me or maybe its just what life is.","#12147

Am I the only who think that most Sfu TAs are useless af?! I do not mean all the TAs are bad and useless... I know a few TAs are nice, treating students as friends, and give good advise! But most of them are really... bad! Bad at teaching and communicating with students...
This semester, there‚Äôs one TA who came in the room, and hand us a bunch of exercise, and ask us to divide into groups and do the questions all by ourselves, while she‚Äôs just sitting down, or wandering around the classroom... one thing that I have to mention is, most student of that tutorial are Chinese, only 2 non Chinese speakers in the room... our TA is also a Chinese, so when student ask her questions, she basically just answered in Chinese. one time I was paired up with a dude who don‚Äôt speak Chinese, I raised my hand and ask my TA to explain the question, she just speaks Chinese... I understand Chinese, and I know she‚Äôs trying to help me understand the question better, but that‚Äôs so rude to that guy, he was just sitting next to me, wondering what tf are we talking about, and I feel sorry for him...she just gave up speaking in English... End up I have to translate everything to that guy. Moreover, that was a 50mins tutorial, and she made us worked for 25mins, and ask us explain the answer group by group, we usually end up with a 1 hour 15 mins tutorial ... some people just leave the class before she dismissed us.
I also hate those TAs that pick students to answer question during tutorials. I mean, if I find the topic interesting , I‚Äôll say something right? Why do U have to force me to say something when I don‚Äôt know what to say or when I don‚Äôt understand what are u saying ?? I know we have to engage during tutorials in order to get that 10-15% mark of the final grade.... but can‚Äôt we just choose not to speak when we don‚Äôt want to? That makes us feel so stressed! Especially as a person who don‚Äôt speak English as a mother language, when I‚Äôm nervous I cannot speak at all.... I just really hate those TAs keeps saying, ‚Äú_____ what do u think ? Can u explain ur thoughts?? ‚Äú Jeez!!!!
Overall, I just want to say, TAs are suppose to help students to understand the course material, especially when the professor of the course has an extremely low rating on RMP website ..not just sit there and ask us to discuss the shit out of something we don‚Äôt really know!! Hope TAs will understand us more!","#12144

Now that clubs day is over. I think we need to talk about the subtle racial/national discrimination within clubs. I went to a Chinese club and spoke to them in English. The people didn't look at me in the eye and instead at their phones. it may be due to cultural differences but I'm pretty sure in no culture looking at your phone isn't rude. The guy turned to his friend and said in mandarin 'why do I have to deal with her'. I may be speaking in English, but I can understand you.
Another club I encountered wasn't based on nationality. The majority were Korean. This wasn't a problem except that they even made a pointed remark and said 'most of us are Korean'.
The third one was that it was an Indian dance group, (I forgot which because I was so put off) and it was last semester. They would not talk to me and only spoke to people speaking in their language. (Sounded like Hindi, and yes, I understand. Though it could be a language similar to it) finally there was a girl kind enough to talk to me and explain her group that the dance originated from India. (That was how I knew it was an Indian dance club)
How do we expect people to learn about cultures etc if we have this attitude? Why are you even here if you refuse to mingle and learn about others.
Yes, there are good people of every race, but its the bad ones that cause these stereotypes of dirty, rude Chinese people, terrorist Indians etc.
To be honest, even though I'm not white I don't get the outrage when people suggest an European country club or whatever as a bad thing. If seen it once or twice on our reddit page and on this page and its met with massive lots of people against it. We have Chinese clubs (way too many) etc. Whats the problem with a Swedish club or whatever?","#12139

My brother is an idiot. I'll give you a quick rundown. He just started going to university in Ottawa. His friend met this girl and was trying his luck with her. As time passes, he introduces her to my bro. she catches the feels for my bro and his friend was upset. so Brother comes and asks what should i do and i'm like if you care bout the friend, you should probably stay out of it till the girl breaks it to him that she likes you. Evidently he didn't give a fuck about the friend because they started dating the day i gave him advice. Now my brother finds out the girl has some mad baggage (exes she hadn't gotten over, she also told him she was torn between him and some other guy while they were dating). I hear this and i'm like ""yo, these are the reddest flags i've ever seen. you should break this off before this gets ugly"". This dumbass looks me in the eye and says he'll stay and maybe eventually she'll come to love him. This disgusted my soul so much i think i coughed blood and shat out my heart. Looking like some corny teen drama on crack. So yeah, this is gonna end badly and ill be waiting with that ""i told you so"". I actually don't even care about all that anymore. My concern is that evidently somewhere in my bloodline there must be a stupidity gene. How do i make sure it remains dormant in me and my future kids.","#12133

I am absolutely disgusted by the restaurant establishments here at SFU burnaby.
Renaissance coffee:
I am a regular customer here but one of the ladies that always work there is somehow seriously so rude to me and gives me the most attitude. I don't get it. Also, I am absolutely annoyed by the fact that they had replaced the coffee shop in MBC with ANOTHER renassiance coffee. I am so sick of seeing them buy every corner when they sell a tiny coffee for $1.60 and butter chicken that is watery, dry and rice that sticks to the damn container. Also there fruit cups may look okay but BEWARE of the mouldy grapes at the bottom after u finished eating the entire mouldy fruit cup. HAVE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REEVALUATE UR WHOLE BUSINESS PLS.
Mackenzie Cafe:
Seriously, ur portions are so fucken small and so expensive. Who charges a damn california roll that I've seen you cut half a roll into 8 pcs and charge for $5.99 or whatever since I do NOT ever go or purchase anything from there anymore. And half a sandwich from the sandwich bar seriously costs about $5.99 or smt seriously and a damn salad that in the fridge is shallower that a piece of paper is fridge $6.99 or $7.99. hahah i hope you go out of business with no one purchasing your products anymore and contributing to food wastage. I know you're trying to be ""gourmet"" but it aint working cause you'll be bankrupt by then. LOWER UR COSTS AND BRING UR PORTIONS BACK UP TO NORMAL.
Korean place at MBC:
Your rice is mushy AS FUCK. Its so disgusting because you literally fill the ex. beef rice bowl with 95% rice and 5% beef topping.. and your ""ramen"" is literally $8.99 instant noodles that i can better myself for 50 cents. Also those noodles are soggy AS FUCK. COOK BETTER AND GET UR PORTIONS RIGHT.
Noodle Waffle Cafe:
Your food is good BUT I have found a piece of hair deep in my food about 3 TIMES ALREADY. WEAR A HAIR NET AND WEAR A HAT.
Chinese restaurant that prepares all the food out in Cornerstone:
Perpare to get something you did not pick out. I did not want sweet and sour pork, in fact I hate it but they just quickly put shit on ur plate so they wish and help the next guest. Also those pork things were dry AS FUCK and the green beans are soggy AS FUCK. Never went back there. HAVE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND COOK BETTER.
Spicy stone at Cornerstone:
Your spicy chicken rice or whatever was SO DRY it was like shreds of dry chicken breast. It is not like the good chicken japanese restaurants use. CHANGE THIS.
Hope you all enjoyed my unpleasant experiences and

One of the most valuable lessons I learned here up at SFU is that it's very hard to stop bad habits. Like, I have a habit of talking shit about people and it's always been a thing I've wanted to fix. I've gotten better over the years but it's still a problem. It's hard to stop some of these things. I learned that by writing down progress, it has helped me come a long way from where I used to be.
p.s. I need to remind myself that I need to stop being a little bitch again.","#12130

‚ÄúDo you like us?‚Äù
We all sat around the counter in an Airbnb when she suddenly asked me the question, her tone tinting with maybe a little bit of concern.
I had joined several others on a road trip, many of them strangers to me.
Maybe it was because of my quietness up until that point that prompted the question. It was the second day, and they still knew nothing of me, nor I of them. I was never a loud or expressive person; writing has been the only window for me to express my thoughts.
‚ÄúDo you like us?‚Äù
That question made me start thinking about why some people get so much more out of the experiences they share with others. I've gotten to meet a few people who have extraordinary communication skills. Wherever they go, they turn strangers around them to close friends. They aren't the stereotypical people who want to be popular in the slightest - they are truly amazing individuals who are able to bring out the best in people around them. They are, in every sense, ‚Äúwinning with people‚Äù.
I've always looked up to these few individuals, and wondered if they were just naturally born with these extraordinary communication skills. Or were they once the same as me, but had somehow painstaking discovered how to free themselves from the invisible shackles to become the way they are now?
(Also, at this point, I'd like to point out that introvert + alcohol does NOT equal extrovert. If you add alcohol to an introvert, you just get a drunk introvert. Though it does help fuel the social battery a bit, so I guess it's not entirely worthless).","#12129

I don't know if this is just a white ppl thing, but I've noticed that whenever I go out to eat with my Asian/brown/black friends, they all offer to pay the bill. But my number one best friend who's white NEVER DOES. In fact none of my white friends offer to pay when we go out. I've paid countless of times thinking they'd pay the next time but they don't. They expect everyone to pay for themselves and I find that hella weird especially when we go somewhere expensive. If we go out in a group, it just makes more sense for one person to pay each time, but the white person will always disagree or just pay for themselves. Talk about social etiquette.... Smh. Also it's funny how me and my non-white/Christian friends bought each other gifts for Christmas but my white friends didn't, they just took the gifts lmao.
BTW, I don't think so highly of myself just because I offer to pay for my friends.. It's just the way I've been raised because my parents and older siblings do that with their friends. Nor am I trying to sound like a freeloader expecting my friends to pay. It's a simple give and take situation.","#12127

The drive through girl looked somewhat tired when she handed me my ice cream, so for some reason my mind told me to cheer her up.
I grabbed the ice cream by the vanilla side and took a bite out of the waffle cone and paper. We had a split second of silence as we made eye contact of what just happened.

No. if clothes really mattered nude beaches would be 100% raped, and ISIS wouldnt be raping anyone. Not to mention this is fucking slap in the face to Kevin Spaceys victims who wear not even female.
second, I also hada friend who said no can mean yes. Where the fuck did you get that? Even if she or he said no but wanted it, you wait for the ok in case you misread her body cues, which happens a lot.
This isnt some 'now feminists want written consent' blah blah blah joke.

In my very first semester at SFU, I had a tutorial on the 5th floor in the AQ. Being a first year kid and not knowing anyone, I was scared shitless that I didn't have any friends. I think the only thing that helped make the tutorial less awful was this really cute guy. This tutorial was a class of 14 girls and 2 guys so I guess this made him stand out a bit more. Also, I knew sooner or later that I wouldn't survive this dry ass tutorial without a friend so I found the courage to speak to the girl beside me.
This semester I have a tutorial 5th floor of the AQ (not the exact tutorial as the one in my first semester), but I was definitely feeling nostalgic.
Fast forward to present day, I am happily dating the same guy I had a crush on, on the very first day of tutorial (I literally fell for him the minute I laid eyes on him) and the girl I spoke to back then is now my best friend at SFU and I honestly love them both so much.

I have been working at Sears for a year and I'm going to miss working there. I can go for a smoke like every hour, buy foods and coffee during work shift. Some worker just doesn't like it, but too bad. I know they complain to the manager before. Sometimes I tell my worker what to do. The only bad part is two guys doesn't want to lift heavy items. For example, refrigerator, stove, treadmill, washing machine. They didn't have a good experience, but you have to learn. I can do it myself, but I choose not to. They told me is safer to work together so no one get back injury, but I told them wtf just do it by yourself.","#12115

Have you ever met someone best described as ‚Äúviciously stupid‚Äù? Generally, the stupid (defined here as students with remarkably low GPAs) students I‚Äôve met are the same type of students: they‚Äôre highly disorganized, not detail oriented or disciplined. Clear-cut, poster-child, Type -A personalities. It‚Äôs obvious that their GPAs are reflective both of their IQs but also their work ethics; that they earned their grades because they have unsustainable and/or dumb study habits. But I‚Äôve slowly noticed that there is another type of ‚Äúdumb‚Äù student. The type of student whose stupidity is almost‚Ä¶aggressive. They‚Äôre the kind that sleep in lecture, are late to class, seem to never pay attention to anything the TA/prof says, and somehow pull 13.4% on exams. But when they settle down to study, it‚Äôs like their brains are dying of thirst from lack of knowledge. It‚Äôs like they have an internal switch that flicks on and suddenly they possess this intensity, this focus that procrastinates at an inhumane rate. It seems almost destabilizing, as if they spend their days trying to contain their brains inside their skulls and keep it from spilling out their ears. I can‚Äôt find a way to explain it, but I‚Äôve met a couple people like this, and I‚Äôm sure somebody out there knows what I‚Äôm talking about. Talking to them doesn‚Äôt ring any bells or raise any flags and make you think ‚ÄúI bet they‚Äôre super dumb‚Äù, but if you‚Äôve seen that switch, that complete 360, then you know what I‚Äôm talking about.","#12112

Dear friends that I‚Äôve lost along the way,
I had a dream last night. In my dream, we‚Äôve gathered around the beach, the way we did every year. We watched the fireworks and laughed as if everything was alright. It was a good dream. I woke up with a solemn heart, at the realization how far we‚Äôve strayed from those days. The days we‚Äôve swore we were family didn‚Äôt seem that long ago. We spent so much time taking our friendship for granted, believing that it was unbreakable, until something finally did.
‚ÄúFriends come and go‚Äù my parents always told me. I never once believed it. It‚Äôs very odd because at one point, I really didn‚Äôt consider you guys as just friends.

I found some old videos that we took of each other back then, and I always look at them with a smile. Always. Until the video ends, I smile so hard it hurts.

School, personal and work were only a few factors. A part of me was convinced if we were able to make past college, we‚Äôd be friends forever. That was pretty silly of me.
I think we all have regrets, but I never did once regret meeting all of you. In one way or another, you all made me the person I am today. For better or worse. The only regret I have is how it ended, and the stories we‚Äôve weren‚Äôt able to create together. But even now as I write this, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs possible that we‚Äôll ever get back to where we were. The opportunity is long gone. But the memory of our hangouts will shine ever so brightly.

Dear friends that I‚Äôve lost along the way,
I had a dream last night. In my dream, we‚Äôve gathered around the beach, the way we did every year. We watched the fireworks and laughed as if everything was alright. It was a good dream. I woke up with a solemn heart, at the realization how far we‚Äôve strayed from those days. The days we‚Äôve swore we were family didn‚Äôt seem that long ago. We spent so much time taking our friendship for granted, believing that it was unbreakable, until something finally did.
‚ÄúFriends come and go‚Äù my parents always told me. I never once believed it. It‚Äôs very odd because at one point, I really didn‚Äôt consider you guys as just friends. I considered you guys family, a permanent fixture of uncles and aunts for my kids someday. Perhaps it was na√Øve of me, perhaps it was na√Øve of us to say such things, only for us to come so easily undone. Even now, I‚Äôm still angry.

What I don‚Äôt understand is how our parking and mobility services can be so inefficient. At the beginning of every semester, there is bound to have a consistent 30-40 people lineup throughout the day waiting to get their parking passes. Has nobody ever thought of possibly implementing new strategies to fix that issue? Can we not do an online process + pickup? Or add more people on staff? I came to get my parking pass today and it took me nearly 2 hours. Does nobody at SFU ever think about improving student experience?","#12095

There are somethings that I want to let out but I can't tell my friends... Here are some things I want to tell:
1. I had a crush for a girl who was best friends with the girl who I was seeing. Let's called the crush variable y and the girl who I was seeing variable x. I started to like y because I really liked her personality and I couldn't stop being red when she looked at me. X was already originally jealous of y so I made sure I didn't talk to y much. Ironically, x started fucking my childhood friend's friend while she was still seeing me. Some would classify this as cheating because we were supposed to be seeing each other seriously at that point in the relationship. I didn't care but I was sad that I couldn't get closer with y. Y is very down to earth and overall a good person. None of my friends cared when I did tell them this. I kind of really want to talk to girl y though. Too bad it's too late now. Girl x shit talked about me from Skyrim then to Oblivion already.
2. (Cont of 1) I found out that x was cheating on me with my childhood friend's friend because I saw them making out in the car in front of her house when I was trying to surprise her with flowers... Yeah, I don't think he ever found out that she was seeing both of us until I broke it off from her. I would have confronted them but.. I couldn't get myself to do it. I saw that guy walk into the house with her. I don't want to tell my friends this because I know how much drama this will cause. I like keeping it peaceful. I'm glad that I cut her off. I roasted that turkey on Thanksgiving and kicked it out of the front door(not literally, I meant metaphorically).
3. A girl who I was seeing cheated on her boyfriend with me for half a year. They proceeded to call me a fuck boy after finding out about the boyfriend... I really liked her as a friend and I wanted to be in a relationship with her but that fell short. We ended on horrible terms. I haven't seen anyone since nor will I see anyone for a while...
4. I tested some ""close"" friends to see which ones were actually loyal by saying fucked up shit to how it spread. It was effective and I cut off a good amount of bad apples. I did this because I knew some one or a few of them were talking shit and was heavily affecting my social life. People ask why I don't trust people. This is why. I know, this was pretty fucking vindictive and immature. I want to move on from this completely and that's why I don't tell my friends this.
4. After dating an ex for a while, I got to know her more as a person. I couldn't keep my dick up because of how horrible her attitude and personality was. She complained about my erectile dysfunction and proceeded to ridicule me for it. We would be having sex and I would deflate mid way because she would turn me off completely by bitching about things like her girlfriends not getting her a LV bag for her birthday... I'm glad we don't talk any more... I can't talk about this because some friends are still close with her...","#12093

Recently we ran into each other in the most unlikely situation, and we really hit it off. Unfortunately he‚Äôs moving to another country soon so we‚Äôll never know if we could have become something, and honestly I have nothing but regret over not talking to him sooner.
The moral of the story is, if you have something to say, just say it. Life is too short to hold things back, and in the end you might uncover something great.","#12092

I don‚Äôt understand why SFU thought it was a good idea to start school on the 3rd. This isn‚Äôt just because I want a longer break, which is a perfectly valid reason on it‚Äôs own, it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a lot of reasons why SFU shouldn‚Äôt start so early. SFU knows it has international students and a lot of students from immigrant families who want to travel back to visit family for Christmas and New Years. And travelling back might be over an ocean, changing sleep schedules that they need to fix once they get back here. Then you have the fact there is literally only one day between new years and classes starting on which to get back on time, which is probably when a lot of other people are travelling back too. Furthermore, getting over the ocean is expensive, if you‚Äôre overseas with family, you want to get as many days as you can after your trip.
And yeah I‚Äôm expecting someone to comment about ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù and how it‚Äôs like having a job, but with work you punch out and you leave it there unless you want to keep working (or maybe your job/field sucks and you‚Äôre expected to always be working idk). With school, you‚Äôre expected to be doing expected to always be doing things. Things don‚Äôt end after class like work, you‚Äôre expected to study outside of class and write papers etc. Once you start the semester, it‚Äôs just one continuous flow of papers, projects, exams until the semester ends. Reading break isn‚Äôt a break either, everyone expects you to keep doing stuff, which is why everyone dumps a bunch of exams and project deadlines the week after. It‚Äôs nothing a real break without school lingering over your head.
Even if people are supposed to be ready immediately following new year‚Äôs, SFU knows that most students aren‚Äôt. This isn‚Äôt like fall semester beginning after Labour Day which everyone expects. SFU knows people are going to be busy over winter break, doing stuff with family and friends, stuff which can be good but still tiring. SFU knows a lot of students travel overseas and need time to adjust after getting back. Yet they still decided to have half the classes start immediately following new year‚Äôs? It‚Äôs not like this disadvantage is fatal to people‚Äôs semesters, people can catch up, but does SFU really want to put some of their students at a heavy disadvantage right at the start of the semester?","#12090

It mindblows me when I hear rich people talk about being poor. There's a group of white guys in one of my classes (who wear yeezys, bape, supreme) and their New Years resolution is to become rappers. And one of their dads built a studio in their basement so they can record and produce songs. And as their ""acquaintance"", I made a grave mistake by asking them to spit a few lines just to see where they're at. Not only did they use the N word, but all their lyrics were about being from the ""hood"" and growing up poor and having to steal and sell drugs to make some money while running away from the Feds. I don't know why it makes me so mad when rich white people pretend to be black or ""from the hood"". Their idea of the hood is the area around Edmonds station... Like are you kidding me. My illegal parents lived in a lower middle class area in Atlanta, working 14 hours a day and escaping raids where they try to catch illegals. Even though we moved to Vancouver 15 years ago, my family still doesn't have an actual house. And now even I work to support my family. I work 2 jobs and my monthly paycheque would still be less than that white boys outfit.","#12088

I had a really great Person of mine pass away a bit ago. I feel like i never fully processed the grief mostly because i dont like dealing with big complex emotions; theyre exhausting to sort through. But ive written a letter to him in hopes that maybe someone out there will relate to these things and know theyre not alone. And also partially for myself. So here goes:
Hey, it has been a while. Ive tried my best to move on, but its proving harder than I thought. The semester keeps me busy and sometimes its busy enough that i dont think about you. Sometimes its not. Lately, youve been on my mind and i gotta say, i miss you. More than I thought i would, which kinda sucks. There are days where i wake up and it feels almost like i just heard you were gone. I feel a little lost. I know that people say that time heals all wounds, but im starting to think that this ache wont get any easier. Will my grief ever get any lighter to carry?
Im nearing the end of my degree and i wish you and i could walk across that stage and look back on the journey we have made. You always seemed to see our (frankly, grueling) major with such excitement. My classes would have been infinitely better with you in them, and im sure you would have loved how much we have learned. I dont think ive ever felt the way i felt about you about anyone else and I know thats an unfair thing to say. And i know that you would say some bs about how ""theres a million guys like me out there"" but you were aces. You were funny and kind and smart and charming and so amazing and i never understood why out of everyone you ever met you chose to spend your time with me. When i met you it felt like i struck gold. Like the first lottery ticket i ever bought was the winning one. But i gotta move on, even if it hurts. Even if i dont want to.

I guess, this might be good bye for a little bit. Ill pop in again, hopefully when im in a better place.
Anyway, ya i think thats all I have to say. You were great. Thank you for everything youve given me. Hey, if i even play my cards right i might be good enough to come see you one day. But until then, i guess this is it. Adios hombre (i know u hate it when i call you that).

I had a really great Person of mine pass away a bit ago. I feel like i never fully processed the grief mostly because i dont like dealing with big complex emotions; theyre exhausting to sort through. But ive written a letter to him in hopes that maybe someone out there will relate to these things and know theyre not alone. And also partially for myself. So here goes:
Hey, it has been a while. Ive tried my best to move on, but its proving harder than I thought. The semester keeps me busy and sometimes its busy enough that i dont think about you. Sometimes its not. Lately, youve been on my mind and i gotta say, i miss you. More than I thought i would, which kinda sucks. There are days where i wake up and it feels almost like i just heard you were gone. I feel a little lost. I know that people say that time heals all wounds, but im starting to think that this ache wont get any easier. Will my grief ever get any lighter to carry?
Im nearing the end of my degree and i wish you and i could walk across that stage and look back on the journey we have made. You always seemed to see our (frankly, grueling) major with such excitement. My classes would have been infinitely better with you in them, and im sure you would have loved how much we have learned. I dont think ive ever felt the way i felt about you about anyone else and I know thats an unfair thing to say. And i know that you would say some bs about how ""theres a million guys like me out there"" but you were aces. You were funny and kind and smart and charming and so amazing and i never understood why out of everyone you ever met you chose to spend your time with me. When i met you it felt like i struck gold. Like the first lottery ticket i ever bought was the winning one. But i gotta move on, even if it hurts. Even if i dont want to. Even if it feels like there could not possibly be anything that could make me feel better that day, i have to try. For you, for me, for my friends and my family. I guess, this might be good bye for a little bit. Ill pop in again, hopefully when im in a better place.

I have a bad habit that i havent ever confronted. Ive always sorta lone wolfed my way through life and im usually pretty ok with that. I value time alone. But when i make new friends, im unusually nervous. And sometimes i think that theyre annoyed with me. sometimes its just little things like how we dont talk outside class/meetings or they never reply to messages or reply hours later. And so, because of this, i become purposely annoying or ill ghost or ill introduce them to someone cooler or funnier or prettier so that theyll actually leave. So ill have something to point to when im no longer their friend. To protect myself? Idek. Its basically self-sabatoge but i cant stop myself from doing it. I cut people outta my life faster than the semester break goes by and not because theyre bad people, but because i cant bear the thought of them doing it to me.","#12082

I'm close to my final course or two next semester, and then poof-graduation.
To be really honest I'm not really that excited. Looking back, the only notable achievement I can think of is managing to transfer to Beedie after nearly flunking out of sciences.
Besides from that, I didn't really do much. Didn't take advantage of the opportunities that SFU provided such as co-op, exchange, case competitions and in general getting involved. My GPA is also excessively average and not competitive at all.
In short I really wish I could go back and try it all because I feel like i sort of wasted my degree...","#12077

Here's a break from all the post-exam negativity. I got my first A after some time on academic probation, I made new friends this semester, and I've made enough money on my almost-full-time job to start paying for tuition myself (and have a good amount leftover).
It's nice pursuing a high grade instead of a passing grade this semester. I interacted more with my TAs and felt that I could connect with my classmates better. I finished my assignments ahead of time and used the last day to fine-tune the details, rather than struggling to complete it on time. It was also really nice that I could explain a difficult question to a cute girl from tutorial!
My family never put the pressure on me to be financially independent, but it feels nice to take a big burden off them and to take responsibility for my education.
I'm not 100% there yet, but this gets the snowball rolling, and hopefully the snowball doesn't crash into a big tree next semester! I guess the message is that if I can do it, anybody can.
Sorry, no punchline, this is just a positive confession.","#12074

I got all my grades back and I am honestly not sure what to say. Part of me is doesn't feel anything because there's a sort of numb acceptance for whatever I got but part of me is feeling full of shame and embarrassment who I've become. I used to get killer grades and now I'm just barely average. While I wasn't top of the class or anything, I was always surrounded by a group of friends that strictly determined their value by how good their grades were, and I was definitely above average and considered ""respectable"". Today, even after giving it every last drop of blood, sweat and tears; even after staying awake until I hallucinate, ingesting caffiene and drugs until I can't even sit without permanent restless leg syndrome, I am still just average all-round. I guess that's what university wakes you up from: a dream that you were once anything ever important, or special. I can now live a daily reminder that I'm mediocre at best and that my near-death efforts will only put me right in the middle of the pack.","#12073

So a couple nights ago I had just gotten out of an exam and i was in a pretty crappy mood to say the least because I didn't think i did as well as I hoped. As I was walking to the bus loop freezing my ass off, my mood was automatically brightened when I saw the cutest golden retriever puppy ever. My eyes filled with joyful tears as I slowly walked towards the puppy extending my hand for him/her to smell. The puppy seemed excited to see a new human as he tugged on the leash a little. I was just about to politely ask the owner if I could pet the puppy but then out of know where the owner aggressively tugs the leash back then bitterly says ""Sorry he just got out of surgery!"" I was so heart broken and low key upset about it. I accepted the owners decline but i was a little suspicious. To me that puppy did not look like he ""just"" got out of surgery, but i could be wrong. But like if he just got out of surgery why are you walking him at night out in the cold where a bunch of students like me are depressed af about their finals and want to feel some sort of joy by petting a cute puppy but you wont let them, thats a little cruel if you ask me. That whole encounter just topped my horrible day of probably failing my final. I literally had a full mental break down, all i wanted was to pet a puppy because dogs make everything better. I'm probably being overly dramatic but some people don't understand the power of dogs and how much happiness they can bring to people. So just a PSA to people who bring their dogs on campus, please spread the love by letting depressed students like me pet your dogs so we can all end our day with a happy memory of petting a dog or 2.

It wouldn't print for me, and it made me so worried my hands were shaking because i had so much adrenaline in me. To the guy who helped me print the pages, I'm so sorry for bothering you while you were studying. Thanks for saving my life!

Have you ever done something so bad when you were young that still haunts you till this day? Growing up, my family had a lot of personal and financial problems. My parents worked day and night so I used to took care of my sister 24/7. We never even used to see them. At the age of 9/10, I used to wake up at 6 am, make us breakfast and lunch, iron our clothes, get us ready and walk to school. Around this time I had really bad anger issues and My parents believed that it was because i matured at such a young age and dealt with problems that most fifth graders wouldn't even know about. I remember one day after school, my sister (who was just 5 years old) and I were fighting a lot, I got really angry and I threatened her that if she didn't listen to me I would kill myself. She kept fighting with me so I took a knife and cut my wrist. I had obviously never done something like that before. My sister got so scared and didn't talk for the rest of the night. The next day everything went back to normal and we totally forgot about it. But till this day i ball my eyes out when I think about the fact that I exposed my 5 year old sister to something so violent and dangerous. It's probably why I have such a soft spot for her.","#12043

It honestly baffles me how certain professors and TAs can take the time out of their already busy day to be rude to you in an email and make sure that your day is ruined. There is no reason for the TA or prof to be condescending or belittling. I understand that the job may sometimes be hard or stressful for them, but I think being a decent human being in an email without having to make rude remarks is just something that is so easy and effortless to do. You really have to spend time to make sure that your email sounds condescending as if you're superior to that person in order to make the other person feel like absolute shit.Just because you have your masters or phD in the course you're specialized in does not mean you're above any other person. Some profs and TAs forget that there is another person behind the screen struggling with their own problems, just like them.

I still have a long way to go but I'm happy with where I'm at now, and hungrier for more.
This isn't to show off or anything, but I've just seen too much criticism against arts students. I graduated with a communication major at sfu and it took me 6 and a half years. I basked in the laughters and jokes made towards me being in arts from science, engineering, and business students because I knew at the end of the day it's not about the degree, it's my skills, experience, and most importantly attitude.

As an introvert, I have absolutely no idea how to find a relationship. Most SFU clubs meet very occasionally, and most of my classes (and workplace) are people the same gender as I am.
People tend to suggest fairly extrovert-like things. I get that, boldly confessing your love to a pretty girl or going to parties can work for the extroverts, but they're not introvert friendly things to do. I know some people who have tried to forcefully mold themselves into seeming and acting like extroverts, but I honestly don't want to walk that path. I'm myself and wish to be nobody else.","#12009

I am so sad to see my friend‚Äôs heart getting broken because of something he didnt do that he is regreting so much rn.
To all the men out there with a gf. If you guys ever get into a fight, never ever use the silent treatment, because that is called being a child. Silent treatment is a girl‚Äôs thing. (i know some of you are gonna say ‚ÄúOh you sexist! Everybody should be mature and communicate!‚Äù But really lets face it, all or most girls will do it) So to all guys out there, if she says it is your fault, message her, if you think it is her fault, message her. If you dont and choose to wait for her to come to you first (especially when you know she thinks it is your fault), then sorry man but you might have to get a new gf soon, because no girl wants a guy like that. You might think she will come back to you, but things might change without you knowing. Before you know it, she is ready to give up on being with a child such as yourself. But ofc, dont do anything if you dont love her that much anyways. No matter how much you think the girl loved you, that love can be gone as soon as she realizes she has to deal with a bf with this kind of behaviour. Please, if you guys want to stay with your gf, man up, take control and initiate.

My dad just got ticketed this morning turning left onto Duthie after coming down the mountain, along with 8 other cars before him who made the ""illegal left turn"" because the left turn lane is designated for buses only during those hours. Apparently the restriction sign has been there for a while now, even though the placement of it is pretty much where the left turn lane starts.. Pretty sure that not many other people have noticed the sign either considering the amount of people who got pulled over today and the amount of times I've seen people turn left during those hours. There's also a transit priority signal too, but I'm not sure how long that's been there since I've never noticed it until today. Sorry city of Burnaby but I think this is such a useless restriction.. I doubt the 144 bus has that much difficulty making a timely turn onto Duthie that early in the day that it needs its own light. Plus, prohibiting other cars from turning left there forces them to continue down hastings, creating more traffic further near Barnet. There are so many other reasons why I think this restriction and the bus signal have little purpose. It ultimately just comes down to me questioning the decision for the restriction and feeling triggered that it's just another money grab by the city. If anything, warnings should've been given today instead of tickets if they were pulling over that many drivers because there's obviously a problem with the sign placement too. Rant over.","#11996

Tldr: there is no cure for yellow fever.
So I‚Äôm born in Canada but my parents are from India. Growing up, I had friends of all different backgrounds and my family was totally cool with the diversity but it seemed somewhat apparent I would have to eventually settle down with an Indian girl. No one in my extended family had gotten married out of our culture/ethnicity and they subtly reminded us of it here and there. I thought this was a bit of backwards thinking because my cousins and I were the first generation in our family to grow up in Canada and we interact with girls/boys of all different ethnicities in our day-to-day vs. our parents who only interacted with Indian people back in India. Another note, ‚ÄúDating‚Äù= getting engaged, to my parents so every gf I had, I never brought home.
Now that you have that context, let‚Äôs dive into high school. I went to a high school that was majority Asian. Yeah yeah I know, some of you are going to say ‚ÄúIndia is in Asia, what are you tryna say???‚Äù but I‚Äôm just throwing that term out there how everyone uses it (Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, etc = Asian people, India = brown people). 3 years of being surrounded by mainly Asian people‚Ä¶. the fever showed its first signs in grade 10. I had dated a white girl and a brown girl up to this point but Asian girls were looking extra fine for some reason. Them Asian girls with the big puppy dog eyes really stood out. I tried to fight the fever, dismissing it for puberty driving my hormones insane but as I reached grade 12 the fever was in full effect.
If you or someone you know has yellow fever, you probably know it is contagious too. I spread that shit like wildfire. All my friends started digging Asian girls too. I dated 2 different Asian girls that year, went to prom with an Asian girl, good god I even learned how to speak a bit of Cantonese. I finally started eating Asian food too, oh man had I been missing out.
It‚Äôs now nearing the end of my first semester at SFU, and I swear I find majority of Asian women attractive. They are the epitome of beauty. Ive currently got an Asian gf who I finally decided to bring home so we could study. Parents were tripping about it quite a bit at first but seem to have adjusted a bit. They remind me about finding a brown girl before school is done but damn, my fever was running high one day and I told them I‚Äôm most likely marrying an Asian. It‚Äôll take time but I think they‚Äôll warm up to that idea.
My fellow brothers and sisters who are pondering an interracial relationship while facing family who aren‚Äôt too open to it, I say fuck it. Break some barriers, do what makes you happy, and don‚Äôt fight the yellow fever because at the end of the day there is no cure.","#11984

I go to Sfu on a full scholarship, I have 2 jobs, I clean and cook 2 meals a week and I tutor my siblings. I don't party, go clubbing or stay out late. I'm usually at home studying on the weekends so they always know where I am. But they're never proud of me, I'm pretty sure they hate me. They borrow money from me and tell me what to do with my earnings and get mad when I spend ""recklessly"". I do everything they say yet they'll never be proud. The only guilty thing I do (that they don't know about) is smoke.

Until today, I have never felt so ashamed of myself as a human, but more importantly as a woman. I was on the skytrain and an older man was standing right in front of me looking at the skytrain map. A few minutes later a young lady goes up to him and tells him how to transfer to get to Surrey (i had my earphones in so I couldn't hear the whole conversation) but because she went to HIM I assumed she knew him from before. Right before the next stop the man grabbed her hand and kissed it and in my head for a split second I was like okay this is weird cuz she's so much younger...but I told myself oh right they already each other but I was wrong. She quickly took her hand back which made him fall over a little and huge bottle of crown royal fell from under his jacket and everyone look at him. The girl was looked so confused and felt completely violated, naturally she looked up at the closest female near her; which was me. She made eye contact with me for 3 whole seconds. I could tell she wanted me to say something but I didn't. No one did. And when the doors opened she ran out crying. I feel like I've let down every woman in the world by this. If you're reading this and you've been harassed while everyone just stood and watched, I'm so sorry. I can't even imagine what a woman must be feeling after an incident like that. I will never forgive myself for not standing up for her. God I'm such a coward.","#11961

TL;DR- Living with my grandparents in their 80s is hard.
My paternal grandparents got their permanent residence card and came to live with my parents and me. Life's been so much more stressful since then.
My mom is very stressed because she has to take care and cook for my grandparents almost 24/7 as they are in their 80s. Grandma acts like a selfish child, according to my mom, and frequently puts grandpa's health in danger (i.e., going on a walk with him outside in cold weather because she feels bored staying in the house while she must know grandpa might catch tuberculosis) by always putting her interest first before thinking about grandpa's situation. The area we live in is quite boring for her (we live in the suburban area) ; grandma always asks us to take her outside. She can't drive, can't speak English, and doesn't have strength to walk to bus station. My parents have to take grandparents to ""interesting and exciting places in BC"" during their off-work days, and they have no ways to rest. Mom and dad fight a lot, and mom's been getting more emotional and hysterical, perhaps because this is not a ""visit."" We have to live with my grandparents for years and more.
Honestly, it's painful for me to see how much they suffer (esp. my mom) and having to be in midst of all this stress. I love my grandparents, they love me, and I don't want to hate them, but constantly having to listen to my mom bickering about my grandparents (esp. grandma) leads me to resent them partially. I want to fully love them without any taint of bitterness, but it's getting harder and harder. I don't know how I can help mom to be coping well with this situation.","#11949

TL;DR I am applying for teacher training program and now I'm wondering whether teaching will be unfitting for me due to workload demands and my introvert personality
I am currently working on the essay for the PDP application (teacher training program) in which I have to describe my passion and reason to go into the teaching field.
My reason for teaching seemed very cliche (""I want to make a difference""), so I went to google to look for ways to make it more developed. I ended up at bunch of videos and links that talked of ""reasons to quit teaching"" and ""why I hate being a teacher."" Basically from reading these sources, working beyond 9-5 shifts, getting overworked, criticized by admin, and hard-to-control students were very appalling and it seemed like it's not the right job for me.
But right now at this moment, when graduation's approaching, and I've already made this plan, it seems highly unsettling to give everything up due to reading few articles (many from US). Plus I volunteer in school, and I love teaching them and working with teachers. But there's this anxiety that teaching will not be the right job for me after all when I really get to have my own classroom... experiencing this crisis at this moment when deadline is approaching is highly inconvenient üò•","#11947

But when I message him, it‚Äôs all left on read/one word answers three hours later.

I feel like society is so unfair and sets double standards when it comes to Male and Female emotional well-being and how they should deal with and react to very sensitive topics.
Few years ago, with a girl's persistence, I told her my father passed away from cancer when I was very young.
Forward to the next Halloween, she was wearing a costume that I jokingly mocked and roasted her about. At the time, I was trying out a buzz cut, almost completely bald (number 0.5).Without having to have anything witty to comeback with, she turned around and said ""what are you supposed to be for Halloween? A cancer patient?"" despite knowing about my father's story.
I was speechless for an hour.
On two occasions I tried to bring it up to her attention that her comments could be very hurtful and that it's not good to joke about such a sensitive topic.
She did not care and replied by saying ""My jokes were actually very funny"".
After that convo, I felt like I should just deal with what she said and not bring it up anymore.
I do realize that I shouldn't be sharing such information with anyone before knowing them.
However, as a male, if we were to switch spots and if I were to make the exact same comments, the reaction would be completely different.There would be an incredible backlash and I would be condemned and berated for my remarks.","#11939

I have everything a person can ask for - freedom, health, confidence, family, friends, education, rewarding job and financial security. Yet, I am extremely unhappy.

I don't do things by halves and I am a loyal person, which is why it‚Äôs hard for me to accept wishy washy behavior. We live in such a messed up world where people constantly act selfishly. I dislike my generation that mostly consists of people with low morals, and convenient seekers with zero sense of ownership of their actions. More so, I hate my negative outlook on life. If anyone is being nice, my first thought is ‚Äúwhat do they want from me?‚Äù. I used to see the best in people but now I assume the worst in them. I feel like what's the point in even trusting someone when eventually they will hurt and disappoint me. The worst part is, I am too good at hiding how much chaos and negativity is in me. I always have a smile on my face and I don't mope around. I have too much anger in me. I do not want to spread my negativity to others. All the good people in my life don't deserve my negativity. I want to see everyone around me happy and I do what I can. But I feel like a hypocrite because I hide my true emotions. I know time is supposed to be the best healer but things haven't gotten better over time. I am always keeping myself occupied to distract myself from my negative thoughts. I want to be able to trust people again. I wish someone showed me through their actions that people are worth trusting.

If anyone is being nice, my first thought is ‚Äúwhat do they want from me?‚Äù. I used to see the best in people but now I assume the worst in them. I feel like what's the point in even trusting someone when eventually they will hurt and disappoint me. The worst part is, I am too good at hiding how much chaos and negativity is in me. I always have a smile on my face and I don't mope around. I have too much anger in me. I do not want to spread my negativity to others. All the good people in my life don't deserve my negativity. I want to see everyone around me happy and I do what I can. But I feel like a hypocrite because I hide my true emotions. I know time is supposed to be the best healer but things haven't gotten better over time. I am always keeping myself occupied to distract myself from my negative thoughts. I want to be able to trust people again. I wish someone showed me through their actions that people are worth trusting. I hate myself everyday for not being able to snap back into the happy and grateful person I once was. I miss myself.",,1510188570,,,34,10,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1352245354902788&id=388417724618894,

I‚Äôve dealt with mental health issues my whole life, lost my best friend to suicide and have almost died from suicide attempts in the past. Still, comedy is comedy and it‚Äôs all just jokes. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten through the stuff I did if I wasn‚Äôt able to laugh at shit like this.

This will be kind of a long confession.
I work at a store in a mall. (won't say which mall). My friend (Friend A) since high school and her younger sister work in another retail store in the same mall.
(Note: Friend A recently quit that job at the beginning of this semester because she had Co-Op but her sister still worked there.)
I'm also acquainted with the manager of the store because of Friend A. Let's call her Friend B
Well, my boss recently told me he was going away on vacation for about 2 weeks and that because he had someone who would come in to manage everything, he didn't need me to come in and would ""call me when he got back"". Now let me tell you, it's an Asian-Run store so in my head, I feared this was his way of firing me because I highly doubted his shady-ass would ""call me"" when he got back.
I also freaked because this is the worst time for this to be happening because it's November and school left me little time to commit to jobhunting.
So basically at this point, I didn't know if I'd still have a a job as my employment status was kind of up in the air.
This resulted in me contacting Friend B to see if she had any available positions or if she was hiring at her store.I told both Friends A & B about my current work situation and luckily, they were hiring.
But then something even worse happened. As I was in the middle of trying to sort out my work situation and sort out my availability for working, I suddenly got told by friend A that Friend B fired her sister so that I could get the job.
I'm still so horrified and I don't know what to do. Friend A is basically not speaking with me even though I intended for none of this to happen and I'm utterly upset and miserable. I feel terrible for Friend A's sister because I didn't know that Friend B would fire her. She claims its because they're ""looking for more people with more availability"" but it's such a terrible thing to do and I don't know how to fix it.","#11923

A few years ago I went camping with one of my best friends.
During the 3 day camp out we only brought meats. We had 0 vegetables. It was basically a 3 day BBQ for 2.
On our last night there I awake around 3am to the most FOUL grumble and pain in my stomach as I realize I have to shit NOW.
I look around for a good place within our little clearing, but there was none where I could comfortably squat. Until I notice his truck we came to the campsite in.
I ran over to the truck and leaned my back on the panel right over the rear wheel well and FUCKING EXPLODE. It HAD to look like that scene in South Park where Cartman made his mom bring the pan for him to shit in.
I wiped off, and went back to bed... Relieved.
I wake up in the morning to my friend shaking me.
"" Bro. Did you shit all over my truck?""
Now I could have said yes and we would have laughed our asses off. I'm not shy about it or anything, but something inside me compelled me to say ""... No?"" just for shit's and giggles.
""Dude. You HAVE GOT to come look at this. There is a literal shit puddle on and around my truck.""
I hadn't seen the puddle when I left earlier in the night since it was so dark. So I got up wondering what it would look like when I turn the corner and see it.
It was repulsive. It was all over his rim and then a massive puddle blob at the bottom near the tire, the area speckled with shit splash damage.
At this point I am trying my HARDEST to not fall over laughing.
He says ""Do you think it was a bear?"" which almost broke me.
So I got on my phone and googled images for ""Bear poop"" and scrolled until I found a pic of something that at least resembled what I had laid and said ""Yea this looks similar.""
So he thought it was bear shit.
But were not done.
When I get home I tell EVERYONE the story. They all know it was me who laid the shit. And the funniest part is hearing my friend retell the story to our other friends (Who know the real story) and they keep laughing hysterically at random parts of the story and he's always like ""Wtf are you guys laughing at? We didn't even get to a good part?""
One day I'll tell him. One day. Maybe take another all meat camping trip and try to ""see if the bear will come back.""","#11922

While on my way to school this morning I got a notification that the skytrain was not working/had delays so I changed my route and ended up being an hour or so early for class. I'd been up late trying to study for a quiz today and was really nervous about it but I was still really tired and sleep deprived so I decided to go to the women's centre to take a little nap. When I opened the door to the women's centre I was greeted by a little corgi standing in the middle of the room looking excited. It was so friendly and cute that after I pet it, it followed me into the back to the couch to ask for a little belly rub. Needless to say, I didn't end up taking a nap that time. Now I don't know how well I did on my quiz this morning but thank you to the owner of that corgi, it made my morning.

NEVER A-FUCKING-GAIN am I gonna order the chicken nuggets from the Bubble Waffle Cafe.
I was hungry in the middle of lecture and decided to buy it on break because I've had the bubble waffle, takoyaki and curry fish ball and it was the only snack I haven't tried on thee menu. It was really salty and kinda gooey at times (I just assumed it was the fat) but it wasn't terrible so I continued eating it. After lecture I had a long transit home as usually, when My stomach started feeling a bit iffy but brushed it off thinking I could hold off till I got home. However, the chicken nuggets had other plans because in the middle of the skytrain ride my stomach started to hurt like a motherfucker and I started to sweat and hyperventilate. I even slid down on the floor of the skytrain (I was standing). I tried taking my jacket and scarf off to ease the sweating but it did very little. At this point some people were looking at me and my vision started to go a bit hazy. I kept trying to look for a skytrain stop that I knew had a washroom near by but it felt like an eternity of blurry vision, sweating and trying to regulate my breath. Finally I got to a skytrain stop that was really close to a shopping mall so I got up (the head rush didn't help my already fragile state) and I could feel the shit trying to vacate itself from my asshole (at this point I knew it was diarrhea) and I tried to rush to find a washroom so I could just shit out my bowels so I could go home and take a long shower. Problem was I wasn't very familiar with this shopping mall and didn't know where the washroom was so I ran around trying to find one while the shit was almost leaking out of my asshole. Before I could ask someone for directions, I realized it was too late and mid-stride I shit myself in the middle of the mall. I was panicking and trying be inconspicuous and trying hide to smell while people passed me as I sat down on a bench(I know it's gross and I wouldn't have done it if o had a choice but I knew if I stood up it would run down my leg).
Luckily I still live with my parents so I asked them to pick me up at the mall and bring a change of clothes with them as I proceeded to spent the remainder of my time in the family washroom trying to get as much shit (literally) off my clothes and body.
What sucks is I was actually planning to study tonight but I gonna spent the rest of my night scrubbing shit off my clothes (except my underwear, that shit couldn't be saved) and disinfecting everything.
TL;DR This has been a Personal and I guess PSA not to order chicken nuggets from the Bubble Waffle Cafe at Maggie Benson in the Burnaby campus lest you wanna shit yourself in public.","#11893

Ok here's a confession. My prof insisted we form study groups to study for his ridiculously wacky exams that no one knows exactly how to study for since everyone almost failed the first midterm. So I post on the class discussion, thinking what the hell, no one else will so I'll give it a shot, at least I tried to start a group, and only one girl answered me. So we exchanged numbers and met at the Starbucks in west mall to study. After a few hours, a soy based coffee beverage,and a protein pack with cheese and crackers, we finished up and went home. That night I began to feel pain in my abdomen area, as well as shivers and then diarrhea joined the party. So the cramps, sweats, shivers, diarrhea and pain and bloating and I were up til 5am..it was crazy! The next day I woke up in a pool of my own sweat only able to reach the phone to email my prof that there was no way I could get up even to go to the hospital with the state I was in. Of course, he won't let me retake the exam. And of course I probably caught something in the germ infested steam room of Starbucks while trying to better study for my midterm which has been my focus all week. Is this ironic or what?? Should I fight for my chance to retake the exam? Or hang my head and take the whipping of the unjust lash of unequal opportunity which has raised enough hell around here that we are building a new universal bathroom for the availability of such equal opportunities??","#11875

I used to think it was annoying, but then I started noticing them and I can‚Äôt help but feel happy that they make each other so happy.

Do you ever ship two people? Not people you know, but absolute strangers. Just two people who aren‚Äôt together, but clearly make each other very happy. For example, there are these two people in my bpk tutorial who seem really nice together. The tutorial is laid out in a way that we do a lot of group work, and whenever we break for discussion, they‚Äôre always making each other laugh like crazy. I used to think it was annoying, but then I started noticing them and I can‚Äôt help but feel happy that they make each other so happy.

My addiction is really taking a toll on my life. I used to be a really smart kid in high school and I was looking forward to studying at SFU for engineering. But I was introduced to a new form of entertainment here at SFU that I never knew would cost me this much. It's all I think about when I don't have it and I get stressed and itch all over. I know that if I quit cold turkey, I could get over it after a few months of discipline and focus, but the withdrawal symptoms are too intense for me. The guilt pings inside me every time I do it, but I always tell myself ""Just one more"". It's spreading to my friends too. It started with one person who shared it with others and now a good percentage of engineering students are getting infected and I feel horrible about it. But the thrill of a 5 combo ending with a Tetris is unexplainably incredible.","#11871

So I think I failed my computing midterm, in a course that I failed already and retaking this semester.
I started my engineering degree last year, with the obvious hope of greatness and the expected challenges to come. Ever since then, it's just been a constant spiral of disappointment and frustration. I've failed many exams, and barely passed a lot as well. I spend almost all my day in classes and then in the library doing nothing but homework and assignments, but just never produce the results I want in my grades. As a result, I'm constantly re-thinking my degree and looking at other programs that are offered, but nothing interests me. Engineering is really the only thing I want to do as a stable career, however, I don't think I can continue like this. I don't believe that I have the type of brain to study these courses or persue this degree. My dream was to work somewhere big like NASA, but now I don't even have the GPA to join the co-op program. I feel like I'm just walking around with no purpose, or expectation for the future. No confidance or motivation, and only worry. I'm just not sure if this is all worth it. I have nobody to blame, but myself really, for not pushing myself further and letting every bad grade get to my head. It feels as if ever since I started here at SFU, my life has progressievly gotten worse.","#11858

As I sit in my university library, while attempting to write a term paper due tonight, I sit surrounded by fellow students who act like they belong in daycare rather than a post-secondary institution. The utter lack of respect for fellow students and accepted behavioural norms today are downright shocking to me, especially as an older student and an introvert. I look around and see no less than 4 people with their feet up on chairs, on tables or desks ‚Äì one of them is even barefoot (I see this on a daily basis). It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôve never once been told in their life that feet do not belong on tables or chairs ‚Äì at home, on the bus or in public, especially not bare feet!
I see groups of students eating and yelling at computers while watching cartoons and yelling at the screen, inside a library, which is a designated quiet / no food or drink area. There are no available computers, every single one is occupied and I‚Äôd say around 30% are being used to watch youtube or browse facebook despite the line up of students waiting to use one and do actual work or print off assignments. If you ever politely ask them to try to keep the noise down, (it‚Äôs a library after all) ‚Äì they‚Äôll just roll their eyes at you and continue with the obnoxious behaviour. How do you grow up without learning basic common courtesy that a library is a ‚Äúquiet‚Äù place and that talking loudly is rude? I probably spent hundreds of hours at the library in Campbell River growing up, I knew this at age 4/5, so how do this 20 year olds not understand that libraries are not for screaming about your dirty laundry or watching soccer games at full volume?
There are groups of girls more than 100ft+ away shrieking and laughing so loudly that everyone on this floor can hear their nonsensical drama and dirty laundry (even through ear plugs). This is the type of behaviour and language (‚Ä¶like totally, like oh my god, that‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ so like, basic like for real?) I‚Äôd expect from 12-14 year old girls, not the future professionals of our society. It‚Äôs equally as bad when students congregate outside of classrooms and shout so loudly it overpowers the professor lecturing (even with a microphone) ‚Äì if you can teach a 5 year old to use their ‚Äúinside voice‚Äù, why can‚Äôt these 20 year olds figure it out?
In my classes many people choose to talk non-stop over the professors, disrupting the learning environment for everyone else who came to listen and learn. Some even watch youtube videos on their laptops or play video games during class, which is incredibly disruptive and distracting to everyone else sitting behind them.
People are glued to their phones everywhere on campus, while standing around or in the hallways or walking up stairs, bumping into others or causing delays in the massive line ups for food or drink because when they get to the register they still don‚Äôt know what to order and haven‚Äôt gotten their money out yet despite being in line for 10minutes.
Anywhere that you can find tables or chairs to study at on campus, there is likely someone taking up 3-4 seats with their bare feet on the table and backpacks and coats strewn over 2-3 empty chairs, along with groups of students yelling about nonsense so loudly there is no hope in hell of studying or doing anything productive in the nearby vicinity.
The majority of students are incapable of saying please or thank you to the service staff, nor do they hold doors open for their peers or teachers. Even at the 4th year level I still see students handing in reports without cover pages, and asking questions in class that were answered 5 minutes prior, but they were too busy on their phones playing candy crush to listen to the lecture, and wind up wasting everyone else‚Äôs time. I had a girl who skipped the first week of classes come in 1.5hours late to my 3 hour statistics lecture and ask 25+ questions that were all on the syllabus and addressed the week before.
Who raised these young ‚Äúadults‚Äù? Since when did this type of selfish disrespectful behaviour become the norm in our society? Where were their parents while growing up? It‚Äôs as if they can do no wrong. I see so many articles about millenials being unable to find careers after their degrees, but based on what I‚Äôve witnessed at University, I‚Äôm not surprised that so many cannot find jobs when they come off like bratty entitled children who think that the universe revolves around them with zero consideration for fellow students or respect for their professor. These are your future Architects, Lawyers, Doctors, Nurses, Engineers, CEO‚Äôs, Politicians, and teachers. The future is in their hands, and that is a terrifying thought.","#11842

It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôve never once been told in their life that feet do not belong on tables or chairs ‚Äì at home, on the bus or in public, especially not bare feet!
I see groups of students eating and yelling at computers while watching cartoons and yelling at the screen, inside a library, which is a designated quiet / no food or drink area. There are no available computers, every single one is occupied and I‚Äôd say around 30% are being used to watch youtube or browse facebook despite the line up of students waiting to use one and do actual work or print off assignments. If you ever politely ask them to try to keep the noise down, (it‚Äôs a library after all) ‚Äì they‚Äôll just roll their eyes at you and continue with the obnoxious behaviour. How do you grow up without learning basic common courtesy that a library is a ‚Äúquiet‚Äù place and that talking loudly is rude? I probably spent hundreds of hours at the library in Campbell River growing up, I knew this at age 4/5, so how do this 20 year olds not understand that libraries are not for screaming about your dirty laundry or watching soccer games at full volume?
There are groups of girls more than 100ft+ away shrieking and laughing so loudly that everyone on this floor can hear their nonsensical drama and dirty laundry (even through ear plugs). This is the type of behaviour and language (‚Ä¶like totally, like oh my god, that‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ so like, basic like for real?) I‚Äôd expect from 12-14 year old girls, not the future professionals of our society. It‚Äôs equally as bad when students congregate outside of classrooms and shout so loudly it overpowers the professor lecturing (even with a microphone) ‚Äì if you can teach a 5 year old to use their ‚Äúinside voice‚Äù, why can‚Äôt these 20 year olds figure it out?
In my classes many people choose to talk non-stop over the professors, disrupting the learning environment for everyone else who came to listen and learn. Some even watch youtube videos on their laptops or play video games during class, which is incredibly disruptive and distracting to everyone else sitting behind them.
People are glued to their phones everywhere on campus, while standing around or in the hallways or walking up stairs, bumping into others or causing delays in the massive line ups for food or drink because when they get to the register they still don‚Äôt know what to order and haven‚Äôt gotten their money out yet despite being in line for 10minutes.
Anywhere that you can find tables or chairs to study at on campus, there is likely someone taking up 3-4 seats with their bare feet on the table and backpacks and coats strewn over 2-3 empty chairs, along with groups of students yelling about nonsense so loudly there is no hope in hell of studying or doing anything productive in the nearby vicinity.
The majority of students are incapable of saying please or thank you to the service staff, nor do they hold doors open for their peers or teachers. Even at the 4th year level I still see students handing in reports without cover pages, and asking questions in class that were answered 5 minutes prior, but they were too busy on their phones playing candy crush to listen to the lecture, and wind up wasting everyone else‚Äôs time. I had a girl who skipped the first week of classes come in 1.5hours late to my 3 hour statistics lecture and ask 25+ questions that were all on the syllabus and addressed the week before.
Who raised these young ‚Äúadults‚Äù? Since when did this type of selfish disrespectful behaviour become the norm in our society? Where were their parents while growing up? It‚Äôs as if they can do no wrong. I see so many articles about millenials being unable to find careers after their degrees, but based on what I‚Äôve witnessed at University, I‚Äôm not surprised that so many cannot find jobs when they come off like bratty entitled children who think that the universe revolves around them with zero consideration for fellow students or respect for their professor. These are your future Architects, Lawyers, Doctors, Nurses, Engineers, CEO‚Äôs, Politicians, and teachers. The future is in their hands, and that is a terrifying thought.",,1508711607,,,69,35,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1335417383252252&id=388417724618894,

Dear commuters... whether you're a uni student or a highschool student PLEEASE PLEASE PLEEEEEEEEEASE
TAKE YOUR DAMN BAGS OFF AND MOVE TO THE BACKK. You feel like you're getting shoved? TAKE YOUR BACKPACK OFF.
Feel crowded af? TAKE YOUR BACKPACK OFF. Do you wanna get on the bus so you can make it to your appointment?
TELL OTHERS TAKE THEIR BAGS OFF. Oh, I almost forgot! it'd be great if you took off your bags so people dont have to manuver through
a poop ton of backpacks in their way just to get off of their stop. Also, to those who happen to stand right infront of the rear doors, it'd be great
if you looked out for one another and opened the door for people when its a crowded bus (or maybe when its not even crowded. It's a nice gesture)(because sometimes the bus is so crowded from BACKPACKS, people can't
make it to the rear doors in time and the bus driver just goes ""fuck it lets goooo""). AND LASTLY, TO THOSE WHO PILE UP INFORNT OF THE REAR DOOR BLOCKING PPL FROM LEAVING, either move to the back (when it's not busy obvs)
or just get out of the bus for just 3 seconds and hop back in. Even if its raining, 3 seconds of rain won't hurt you, trust me üôÇ

I'm a recent SFU graduate. I've dealt with my depression and anxiety throughout post-secondary without seeking professional help from SFU health and counselling. I regret not taking the chance to use the services that were available to me, but were also easily accessible. It's already been hard enough to even get the motivation to want to finally deal with depression and anxiety by seeking help. Now it just seems even harder. Part of the reason why I never sought help, was also because I didn't want to feel needy, and because I also don't need the judgement of others telling me that other people have ""real"" problems, and that I should just tough it out. I mean, I understand depression is very common, and is becoming increasingly prevalent. But if I've reached that breaking point where I just can't give a fuck about people's judgement anymore, does that validate it a bit more? It's like, besides struggling with depression, I also have to reconcile with feelings of guilt that I'd be taking time from people with problems that are worse than mine. I don't know anymore.","#11832

So today was going well but tripped me up at the end.
I've been doing these study groups and kicking ass (slowly). All was going well until I started working on math in the math workshop.
It's a time for students to meet with profs and get some one on one help. (It's a great idea)
Anyhow, the workshop is held in the math lab and has the doors open with open desks in view. So naturally students come in looking for a desk to work if they're not part of the class. The professor will kindly explain its a reserved classroom and to please find a different place (so far so good, people get this and say ok sure and move on) but here's where the shit hit the fan...
Some fat Chinese guy wearing a dark blue coat and vertically combed hair came in and tried to sit down. So naturally the prof walks over and kindly re-explains the situation and our chubby buddy here gets super pissed. In broken English demands to know what courses the workshop is for. Prof explains they are introductory level math courses and you have to be a student of these classes to use the room. Bubba then proclaims something to the extent of(his English was supershitty so it's pretty hard to make out what he said ) ""Why would anyone need help to do such stupid math? What a waste of time...""
This was said loudly Enough for students to hear and raise heads.
The prof was completely surprised but stayed professional and asked him to leave.
Here's my message to Mr. or Ms. (Don't want to make any assumptions) fatfuck blue coat- ""if I ever see you again I'm going to personally introduce myself by publicly mindfucking (no physical contact will be made**) you so hard you won't know up from down or your own shit from your mother's cooking.""
TLDR: Some fatty thought it was ok to insult students about the level of course they were taking during a workshop for that course. If I ever see them... Their ass is grass.
** The definition of physical contact is confusing at times when dealing shitty people.","#11804

So yesterday afternoon, I went to study for midterms at SFU's surrey campus. While in my study room, the people next to me were making SUCH loud noises. BUT, get this: it wasn't typical loud noises- it wasn't laughter, it wasn't loud music. Rather, they were making these really loud noises. It was like high-pitched voices, and they would say things like ""OKkkkkkkkk""! Or ""WOOW!"". I also couldn't tell if they had accents or not, because they would say shit in really weird ways: for instance - ""WHAT ZE FACK?!"" Or ""Wow, that's a NICE WAN!"". Again, they said it in REALLY high pitched voices- as if they were trying to attract dogs with high-pitched frequencies.
There was also like 2 times when they would scream in these high pitched voices for so long, like 15 seconds at a time. It would be like ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"". I would peek around to see if they're ok, and they would just be sitting at their laptops like nothing is wrong.
This went on for like 8 hours. I'm not even exaggerating or kidding you. Non. STOP. The same weird voices, and the same WEIRD 'catch-phrases' over and over again. It sounded like there was 3 voices, too.
All I'm saying is, if you're going to be studying at SFU- WHATEVER Campus that may be, please BE MINDFUL of who is around you. Please.","#11794

I am an Asian guy who usually have a good temper. But two experiences showed me how irrational anger can easily manifest and cause problems.
First of all, as a new driver in Richmond, I was a little slow in turning left even though there were plenty of gaps in the forward traffic for me to do so. I was honked by a young Chinese driver in a Lamborghini, and I began to become really pissed off and angry. ‚ÄúHow dare that spoiled little bitch honk me!‚Äù ‚Äú I bet his parents bought him the car!‚Äù ‚ÄúI bet he bought his license from China!‚Äù. The whole drive back home I was pissed off and thinking about his honking. Then slowly I calmed down as I knew that being angry does not make me a safe driver. Then it hit me. I was being angry for irrational reasons, as I was indeed very slow to turn left, and I focused on the fact that the honker right behind me drove a Lamborghini which became the source of my anger. However, other cars behind me were also honking me, and I conveniently forgot about them due to my selective perception. I was only angry because of the stereotypes regarding Lamborghinis with young Chinese drivers, and completely ignored my shortcomings in my own driving skills. If the driver right behind me drove a different car, I wouldn‚Äôt be angry at all, and so I understood how anger can be completely irrational and dangerous.
Second of all, in another experience. I was in a Halloween party at the Nest, wearing a mask for my costume which caused my vision to be limited by blind spots. I was walking around the dance floor when I bumped into two tall white guys with one of them kneeling down, and being the Canadian I was raised to be I immediately apologized. However, my Canadian upbringing trained me to expect an ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine‚Äù, but the two white guys told me to polish his shoes in an angry voice, which I responded by saying ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù and simply left. The whole time I was focused on the two white guys being racist and telling me to polish his shoes, I became angry and almost wanted to start a fight. Once again, I was irrational because I was focused on the idea and perception of white guys being mean to Asian guys. I later realized that in my limited vision from my mask, I stepped on one of the white guys‚Äô hands as he was kneeling down to tie his laces, and I kneed his face as well. The other white guy who was his friend wanted me to clean his shoes because there was blood from his hands which I stepped on. I was too obsessed on the race of the two people, and the racial implications, to even care about my own faults in the situations.
These two experiences really taught me how easily emotions can be manipulated, and how tapping into people‚Äôs anger can lead to things like the Nazis. Anger is often irrational and often dangerous, and we are always fed media narratives that strengthen these irrational angers to even care about the details. This is a dangerous realization.","#11791

I work full time because I did not want to be in debt by taking out a student loan. Their response of ‚Äòwe do not accommodate work schedule‚Äô has made me very upset. It seems like they do not care if we have a job or any other financial obligations.

Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.
I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.
As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.
In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.
Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.

But occasionally you need a break from studying and need to hang out with friends. How does one make friends on this campus?!?! Most people leave before 4 because they just wanna get away from here. I've tried joining clubs and haven't made a lot of friends there. And even if I did they ended up being commuters that don't wanna come back up onto campus to hang out or do anything really. For the most part people in res don't even talk to each other so it gets pretty lonely. Yup people just go back into their rooms without even saying hi to each other... The concrete structures don't help with the mood either and everything is all squished together! Why on earth was a uni built on a mountain?

The school is pretty bad at planning social events and where are allll the parties at?

Last year I was really depressed to the point of having suicidal thoughts and was seeing one of the counsellors at SFU about it for several months. It took a long time for me to trust them enough to open up about things. Only one person in my life outside of the counsellor and myself even knew I was having issues and seeing someone about it. It isn't something I can go to my family about and I didn't really trust my friends except for one of them. I was really starting to get better then I was gone for several months which was really good for me. I emailed my counsellor a couple times while I was away looking for advice because of things that came up. I got back and went to see them and was told that they no longer work at SFU. I only really want to ask them about a couple of fairly minor things, but anyone else won't see things the same way because they lack the history. I don't want to go back and open up to someone else who is just going to end up leaving. It would likely take trying multiple counsellors and several months with one that I clicked with to even get to the point where I feel like I can let them in and by that point the things I want advice on dealing with will be long past. I don't know if any of my friends will read this but if you suspect it is me please don't tag me.","#11764

There's been so much pain in these confessions lately. I just want to say to any of you who are feeling that pain, the crushing tsunamis of emotion that feel like they're going to drown you - it's okay. It's okay to feel that darkness. The pain gets better with time, and eventually something else will take its place. I've been through a mental illness that left me on my knees, crying for someone to help, when no one was there. I've lost people I love, and I never thought I would ever put the broken pieces of myself back together. But I made it through the storm. We all have our own storms. Everyone is hiding the pain behind their eyes that they don't want anyone to see. We can all get through that pain if we fight. I know that when you feel that darkness, you think that it will never end, and that you will keep suffering for the rest of your life. But I'm telling you, with time it goes away. One day you'll look back and you'll be grateful for the times your heart was left bloodied and bruised. You'll be grateful that you learned how to pick yourself up off the ground when all you wanted was to give up, to stay there on the floor. Pain is what shapes us. If you didn't feel that pain, you wouldn't be who you are today. In time you'll realize that the scars on your heart made you a stronger, better person, and without them you would be a shadow of your true potential. Don't give up, because something greater is on the other side of your pain.","#11761

Dude: Soo, what do you think about same sex marriage?
Me: Hmm? What I think about what?
D: Same sex marriage, you know with the voting and all that crazy opposition.
M: Oh, that, yeah, I'm super against that.
D: What?! Why?
M: Well, because if I'm gonna get married. Having the same sex forever is gonna get boring, I wanna do some kinky shit once in awhile man. (Straight face)

I'm so stress right now. My aunt and uncle are staying with me and my mom just for a month. Ever since they enter my place, they cause so much mess. I don't have my room anymore and no place to study. They are like my grandparents, but they don't have any manners! The uncle doesn't close the door when he is using the washroom and gets grumpy if I ask him to. The other day, we went to an Italian restaurant. I ordered for them and when the food arrives, he got mad at his wife, why order food for me, just eat the free bread. Is $11 pasta that expensive? I later told the waiter to have it take out. Every time when I study in the living room, the aunt always looks over my shoulder. I hate it when people look over my shoulder, like are you a security? She also doesn't knock on my mom's door and just walk in. I guess this is common Chinese household. I want to drop out of my classes and go somewhere far. Eating at home is also painful, since the uncle slurp his soup loudly and the aunt talks while chewing her food. Me and my mom both hate it a lot. I talked to my mom and told me just to wait. My aunt told my mom that her daughter is coming soon to Canada. In NOVEMBER! I'm like Jesus Christ are you fucking kidding me? Don't you see I'm stress out already?","#11711

It's only been 5 years since I've started University and I've been struggling. I've been late to all of my classes since first year because I‚Äôve been having a hard time giving directions to freshmen girls. I don't recognize anyone I used to know and I have a hard time keeping up with friends.
One of the biggest differences I've noticed between first and fifth year is how much more you are on your own. Nobody shows up to class. Nobody cares what your grades are or if you have crippling depression. Nobody cares if you are really in debt. It feels like nobody gives a damn about anyone.
I've checked this page multiple of times and it scares the living hell out of me when I see posts that depict guys as ""predator"" or ""beta"". In the five years alone I've had helped tons of girls who needed help. I genuinely want to help them with directions.
I need to know they aren‚Äôt just trying to get into my pants and wallet so that they can lie to their girl friends of how I am a player. I only have myself to rely on.
I decided that I was sick of feeling victimized and decided to take action. If a girl wants to directions, she must prove that she isn‚Äôt a gold digger. If there's one thing that life has taught me, it's that you can't trust what a woman says. To truly feel safe, I had to check if the person could keep any gold digging and dick grabbing urges to themselves. In other words, I would ""gold digger check"" anyone who asks for help.
This year, a girl asked me to show her around. I told her that would be great, just know that sometimes I'll have to check if I‚Äôm wasting my time or not. So, I lead her until we arrived at parking lot B next to her car. I felt something was wrong so I did a ‚Äúgold digger check‚Äù and sure enough she tried to dick grab me!. She claimed she was ‚Äúboner checking‚Äù me. She gave arrogant remarks when I told her I was done giving her a tour
The next girl who asked me to show her around did not have bad intentions when I checked. She was extremely nice and I genuinely believed she had my best interest at heart. Just by using gold digger checks, I had found someone who could save me from just how overwhelming my life at University has been. Apparently, she had boner checks too.
My advice to all guys to take action and gold digger check.
You want to save time, right?","#11703

About a year ago, I broke up with a girl that I had been dating for a few years. It wasn't an easy break up. She told me she had cheated on me with one of her co-workers, a dude she had only known for a few months. I couldn't understand what she was saying. How could the person that I love so much do something so devastating? I was supposed to marry her. How stupid I was.
As hard as it was for me to do it, I had to break up with her. I couldn't trust her anymore. And then began my depression. I no longer wanted to go to my classes, go to work, or to even live in general. I contemplated suicide on numerous occasions. I could not get over her.
As devastating as it felt, I knew that if I kept beating myself up for what she did, I would end up accomplishing nothing. I made a plan to focus on myself. I busted my ass off in school, I hit the gym hard, and I spent more time with friends and family.
As much as I doubted it, a year later, my depression was gone. I made it onto the Dean's Honour roll for the first time ever. I strengthened my relationships with my family and friends. And although I do think about her from time to time, I don't beat myself up about it. I love life!
A clich√© I heard a lot was ""time heals all"". I doubted it a lot, but it turned out to be very true for me. Of course, sitting around depressed and simply killing time wouldn't have done much for me. I put myself first, and i'm glad I did.
TL;DR: My girlfriend cheated on me, we broke up, I went into depression and wanted to kill myself. I didn't kill myself and focused on self improvement. I'm happy now.","#11695

So, today I was in tutorial and the TA was asking us all to write key ideas from our readings on the chalkboard. Which was fine, of course, except for the slightly concerning problem that I had a boner that wouldn't go away and it was almost my turn.
To make things worse, I was in a position where taking the time to do a quick tuck under the waistband would have looked super suspicious.
So I just hoped it would go away by the time it was my turn... It didn't. So I had to get up from my seat and casually stick my textbook over my crotch and I actually wanted to die. Like this hasn't happened to me since early high school, why the fuck is it happening now?
To make matters worse, I was wearing pretty loose shorts, soooo... üòï I'm pretty sure one of the girls across the room noticed because she frowned at me after I sat down. Maybe that was just my imagination, though.
I know we are all adults here and all but I was still mortally embarrassed. If you are the girl who noticed (if you truly did notice) I promise I'm not a creep, I couldn't control it üòû","#11678

I was excited about a new environment where I would be able to make new friends but by the looks of it, people in upper years couldn't find the campus very welcoming and didn't find their friends here.

Today, a guy approached me. I thought he was going to ask me for directions, but instead he asked me little questions about me. I'm a polite person, so I respond as he walks beside me. It was obvious that he was interested in me, so I figured that I would just be nice to him. I figure it takes a lot of gumption to walk up to a complete stranger and stifle the nervousness that overwhelms you and strike up a conversation. I wasn't attracted to him, but that doesn't mean I should rudely dismiss a seemingly nice person. Upon leaving him, I told him I'd see him around and smiled. I hope I didn't discourage him from being (politely) bold in the future! Good luck mate!","#11671

The male sitting at the table beside me actually had to audacity to say ""that's disgusting, keep your gross feminine hygiene more discreet next time"". Completely in shock that a fully grown man could say that, I made a fist with my hand to simulate a vagina, and inserted the tampon like I normally would with my actual vagina.

I want to share my story. I understand I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but it was that one push that really helped me. I have depression. It isn‚Äôt something I had, nor is it something I will eventually get over. Depression isn‚Äôt really something to be ‚Äòcured‚Äô. Much like amputees (dear, amputees, I‚Äôm sorry if this analogy offends you, but it was one I found that helped many understand what mental illnesses are like. If you have a better analogy, do tell) it isn‚Äôt something bad or to be ashamed of. But it means I am no longer whole. It isn‚Äôt something necessarily bad, but it is just what it is. It is a state I must live with. There are ‚Äòprosthetics‚Äô to help people diagnosed with depression to live a manageable live, but it‚Äôs not something that can be erased, at least from my identity.
Now I decided to write this now that I am feeling a lot better. Depression is like cancer. You‚Äôll be left with scars for the rest of your life, whether mental or physical. I write this because I want people to understand. I grew up in an environment that was suffocating me. At first I thought my thoughts, my overly cynical, cruel thoughts were normal, given my family life, my society etc. was a hell hole.
A caring friend of mine, however, suggested I try counselling and to see a doctor. At that time, I secretly laughed. But I gave it a shot, and it worked. I felt better. True, not at the rate I expected, but it did help. Then the counsellor went away and I had to find another one.
I am not going to say it‚Äôs all sunshines and rainbows, I can‚Äôt guarantee that. But given the right counsellor, and hell, believe me, I went through many, in which the desperate attempt to find the right one sometimes made my depression worse, in a way it was worth it. My point however, if you think ‚ÄòLife is shitty, and these thoughts are normal‚Äô it‚Äôs not. No matter how terrible your life is, counsellors, doctors etc can help. At least give yourself a chance.
During my worse times, I had said some cruel things, mostly ‚Äòconservative viewpoints‚Äô, (I am not talking about what is politically conservative) viewpoints that were so rigid, nasty, and downright tribal ‚Äòus‚Äô versus ‚Äòthem‚Äô mentality, when it came to politics, identity etc. As I got better, I started to be able to see different sides.
Now that I am better, I can‚Äôt say I disagree with everything I had ever said during my worse times. I am sorry for a few things I have said or thought however.
But I hope with help we can all heal and try to see different perspectives. I don‚Äôt think things are so black and white.
Shorter version: You may think being sad is normal when you are living a shitty life, but it‚Äôs not. Try seeing specialists. Also, if someone is shitty person, while it doesn‚Äôt excuse what they did, sometimes people do terrible things because they are in pain. (or they are just a shitty person lol) But if you see people acting out, try helping them.","#11653

TL;DR I'm having Post-Welcome Day/Welcome Leader happiness right now.
I've been Welcome Leader for the Faculty of Applied Sciences first-years for quite a few years already. Each of my Welcome Day groups were unique from one another. However, each member in all three groups are talented, open-minded, and almost always so excited to journey in a new chapter in life.
I remember when I was a participant for Welcome Day 4 years ago. I checked each person's nametags to see if the color matched mine (I think it was red for FAS?), and once I did, I introduced myself and see if they were in the same program as I was. From there, I made one new friend. LOL! But, you know what, 4 years later, we are still talking to each other and catching up on our lives.
I mean, sure, each member of my Welcome groups will encounter the realities of university, especially in my program where I have encountered loneliness and isolation first-hand. I've felt the stresses of my writing assignments, the confusion of syntax while doing my programming assignments, and - of course - the doubt of not being able to survive MACM 101.
But, seeing the joy and excitement in each of my Welcome groups (plus, the awesome keynote speech by Blake Fly) always gives me a fresh perspective on how I start every school year. Just the vibe of being surrounded with people who have similar interests and goals as you is always comforting and always reminds me that I'm not alone in my university life. Sometimes, I would make a few close friends in those Welcome groups just by randomly catching up with them and being accountable for them.
I dunno about you, but there's always a feel-good vibe in being Welcome Leader and introducing myself to new students in the same program/faculty as you. What's even more special is the happiness I get after being Welcome Leader, knowing that I've inspired at least one person in that Welcome group in some way, shape, or form.","#11638

This might be a bit long, so I apologize in advance.
I've been dating my boyfriend for over two years now, and I love him dearly, to the point where I honestly see myself being together with him for the rest of our lives. I know some of you might think it is just temporary, but we've made it through so many ups and downs, as well as being completely open with our thoughts and feelings. We've accepted each other's flaws and weaknesses, and try to make each other better. Many of our friends and family members admire our relationship, thinking that we are perfect together. However, we aren't so perfect...
He and I have both uphold a moral standard of ""no sex before marriage"". We tried to abstain from being sexually intimate with each other, but unfortunately, the temptation is too great. It's pleasurable and all, plus the fact that we like to make each other feel good, and yet afterward, it's just a guilt trip. I constantly think to myself, ""OKAY, THAT'S THE LAST TIME. NO MORE."". Things just do not fall into place that way. It has become our darkest secret for a long time now, and we are both ashamed of it.
Secrets are never kept long, as we all know. One day, it'll be out in the open, and someone will know. Today, that happened to us. His parents found out, and immediately things became a blur (btw, they aren't okay with sexual intimacy before marriage). I don't know for sure what is going on through their minds, but I am emotionally distraught. I kept it together for my boyfriend because I knew that if I broke down in front of him, he will be even more overwhelmed with the situation. As soon as I got home, when no one was around, I couldn't stop myself from having a mental breakdown. I am completely lost and honest to God, I don't know what to do. I understand I can think of it as a ""mistake"", but I've known in my heart my ""mistake"" was my own weakness. If only I've been stronger and been more firm with him, this might not have happened. Or maybe if I had stopped being alone with him so much in the bedroom, this might not have happened. There are a billion different situations that have gone through my mind about what could have prevented this whole scenario, but what's done is done. I don't think I'll get much sleep tonight, and I don't know if I can handle going to work at the moment.
Either way, I really needed to get this off my chest.","#11622

So there's a guy I met recently who's super funny, sarcastic, and cute. The thing is that I'm an incredibly awkward and shy girl. When I'm nervous around a crush, I just go beet red and pretend they don't exist. I can't even god damn talk to him because he lives on residence and is in a different faculty, so there's <5% chance I'll meet him again. :'-( This is why I'm single.","#11617

You know usually there are beggars outside of Waterfront station and outside of the Timmy's at DT campus. The other day, I was going to my last class at that campus, and there was this mid 30-40 man asking me for some spare changes as usual. As a generic millennial that I am, of course I have no cash. Like who the heck still have changes on them in 2017. JK Anyway, I said sorry man I don't have any coins on me. The guy went on passive aggressive mode saying not even a dollar? You just came out of Timmy's. I didn't say a thing, then this old man behind me heard it and said ""Get a job, you lazy fuck."" I'm like sir I'm buying you a coffee.","#11612

Tl;dr: I‚Äôm lost in life and bored and I miss school/structure.
Note: I went to UVic but I‚Äôm submitting my confession here because they don‚Äôt update their confessions page regularly.
Does anyone else feel super lost and confused? Because I do. For me it started last April, at the end of my second year at UVic, when I was pursuing a major in Gender Studies and minor in my passion, journalism. I‚Äôd accidentally published an article about a person who I valued who had not consented to my publishing. When she found out she was angry and since then we have not spoken. I barely wrote anything at all that summer.
When I came home from school that year I was looking up courses I‚Äôd have to take for my reluctant major, which I‚Äôd impulsively chosen because UVic did not have a journalism major and I did not like my previous major, Creative Writing. I started panicking because I could not see myself dedicating the next two years of my life to a major I wasn‚Äôt interested in. My mom told me that I was allowed to change my mind and have a year off and at the time, that meant everything.
But now, more than a year later, I‚Äôm wondering if I should have just stuck with my original plan. Because since then I have been fired from multiple jobs, changed my mind about what to study/pursue as a career countless times (ex: piano teacher, writer, massage therapist, hair stylist). I have also gone to see a therapist and I was hospitalized for bipolar disorder in late February.
Looking back, my time in the hospital was a safe haven from the shit storm that was my life. But it did interrupt the projects I was pursuing, and now I don‚Äôt know how to regain structure in my life without school. After I got discharged my anxiety has been worse than ever, as has my depression. Now it‚Äôs August and I still haven‚Äôt decided which school I‚Äôm going to go to in September, if I can even make the fall intake. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt even want to do things that I usually like, for fear of being disappointed. And now I‚Äôm just fucking bored.
Anyways, this post is just to vent, don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a point to it. I guess I‚Äôm hoping there are some people out there like me? Sigh.","#11609

Had a severe panic attack in the middle of my final, today. Not something that usually happens to me. And worst thing is, I was ready for that test. I blanked out, lost control of my hands, wasn't able to hold a pen without shivering, crying. I discretely asked the TA if I could go out a few minutes to calm down but it got worst as I bursed out (no sound) in my own incomprehension. The prof then came and gave me a chair to sit and wait for it to go, but I knew it wasnt going to go away. I was so ashamed that I couldnt control neither tears, heavy breathing nor the constant shaking. Went back to class, in a dysfunctional state, where I just stared at my paper until time was up. They said there is nothing they can do about the exam. And wished me a ""nice summer"". I dont understand what has happened. The exam was worth 40%, I will be failing this class.","#11606

I recently finished my degree in Mechanical Engineering and today I went for a second-interview at a job I was applying at. The first interview was a skills test that I had passed with flying colors and the second-interview was more of a personality test. I went in thinking that everything was going to go perfect as I was fairly confident in my abilities correlating with their projects and software.
The first question the guy asks me was ""What's your favorite part about Mechanical Engineering?"". To which I had to think about but made up a fairly sound answer in ""calculating the stress of components and seeing what it takes to make and break them, essentially seeing the world from a different perspective"". To be quite honest, I never really thought about what I loved about Mechanical Engineering, it was a more ""go with the best option"" motive. It was a stable income and it gave stable job security but nothing more then that appealed to me going into the program.
As this interviewer was asking me more questions, the more and more I questioned why I was even in this program. I never built anything and took it apart, I don't have any interest in anything mechanical, hell I haven't even played with Lego!
As the interview went on, the more I realized that I wasn't cut out for this field of work. I think he saw it too. It just wasn't in my interest.
I bullshitted 4 years of my life away because Mechanical Engineering wasn't in particular a nuisance for me. I could actually do it, whereas others may find it too difficult. I found more satisfaction in remaining in the program and proving I had what it takes rather than actually ENJOYING what I was doing and applying it to my real life and catering my interests around it.
It took this interview, this ONE interview to make me realize that maybe this isn't the path for me. Just because an occupation provides a stable income and job security doesn't mean you should take it. Go with your heart.
At the current moment I am giving more thought into what I want to do with my educational path. What course would interest me enough to give it my all? What is my passion? I have yet to figure it out.
TLDR: Figure out what you want to do with your life. Don't just ""Go with the flow"". Make sure it's something you're passionate about and is in your interests. Don't waste 4 years like me.","#11605

I'm such a phony. I don't know where my life is headed. I've always struggled, with school, with work, with my weight, with friendships but I always play it cool in front of my parents cuz I don't want to stress them out. My parents and their siblings cousins friends all have such high expectations of me and I can't let them down. I made it seem like high school and even first year was so easy and now they think I'll be out of sfu in 4 years with double
Degree. I wish I had sat down and told them that I can't do this. I wish I could've shown them all the nights I went without sleeping, or crying myself to sleep. I have no boyfriend, no trustworthy best friend, no hope. I want to buy my parents a house but this city is too expensive. I wanna go to America where you can achieve anything. There's definately a government crisis going on down there but idgaf there's a reason why everyone still wants to move there and that is to make money. This business degree will do nothing for me. I wanna make money hard and fast and I want my parents to retire when I'm 25. But they would never let me drop out. For them me getting an education is #1 for them. But seeing them happy and stress free is #1 for me. My parents worked so hard for me. For what? So I can get a degree, be $30k in debt and compete with 5000 other ppl for a $30/hr job at a bank.

Confession: So... I'm a recent grad coming to Burnaby Campus this fall. I'm really worried about making friends and having a social life because of my lack of one in highschool. I know I can try and be more outgoing this time but also from my understanding classes are going to be lecture halls with hundreds of others. No clue how to talk to people...I tried to get housing because I live in White Rock, and it makes it easier to meet people but I'm waitlisted. I just really need to make some new friends, some good friends because I know the quality of my social life GREATLY affects my academic. I didn't have many friends the last couple years of highschool, and I found out a few of the ones I knew I can't trust because of some shit they did. And on top of this my depression decided to worsen causing me to do worse and barely get into SFU. People keep telling me to join clubs but I'm not good at anything and my social anxiety makes me scared of meeting lots of new people at once. I've heard Burnaby Campus is dreary and lonely but I sincerely hope it doesn't turn out that way...","#11590

So as a transfer student from Douglas, I'm actually really liking my time at SFU. The people here are all really great plus a lot of my friends are transfering over now which is a bonus. This doesn't stop me from attempting to talk to my classmates who I genuinely tend to like in my program. I happen to be the type of person that totally doesn't mnd to send you notes if you missed class or even have to leave mid way through. I absolutely hate it though, when a person asks me to send me notes when they're still IN class. Like so you're just going to sit there for the next 30 - 50 minutes doing nothing, while mooching off my notes.","#11585

I find that I emulate and try to become whatever my crushes at the time are like. For example, the person I currently have a major crush on speaks the native language from our country of origin fluently and I don't because I was born and raised here, so I found myself learning all these proverbs in our native language and trying to learn how to read and write in it, etc. Also, they're not that attractive according to our native culture, so I also found myself looking into the reasons behind euro-centric beauty standards and colonialism. So while I don't think the feeling is mutual between us (i.e fairly certain they don't like me back), I now know my native language a lot better and I am a much more educated human being.
I also remember I had crush on this person a couple years ago who was really into photography, so I went ahead and learned all these photography tricks online. Like I probably know enough to start my own business lol. This directly relates to that post someone made a couple days ago when they said that they started watching calc videos as an arts minor just because their crush was into calc.

I hate people who are chronically late. And I don't mean people who are late to class, because the class will start regardless of whether or not you're present. I'm talking about people who are chronically late to appointments, meetings, hangouts, etc etc. I don't mind people who are a couple minutes late (5-10 I'm fine with), because a couple minutes is just a couple minutes, and I also don't mind if someone is late just once in a while because sometimes there's unexpected delays. But someone who is always late to things that force other people to be inconvenienced is so, so frustrating. The unfortunate thing is that I have a friend like this. They're absolutely great, and one of the best people I have ever met, but I'm always very hesitant to hang out with them because I know that any agreed upon meeting time seems to be a ""suggestion"" to them. They consistently show up 20 - 30 minutes late, and it's slowly starting to cross the line from annoying to angering. And then I feel bad because the rest of time we're together, I'm bothered and no fun to hang out with. People who are constantly late send the message that other people's time is not as important as their own, because everyone else has nothing better to do but wait for them to show up. I, of all people, understand that people are busy and that sometimes to-do lists seem infinitely long, but /that's still not an excuse/. Sometimes I wish I could talk to them about it, but when they show up they always look really rushed and stressed about being late that I immediately feel guilty for feeling frustrated with them. They are already naturally a very anxious person, and can easily get stressed when they have a lot to do so I don‚Äôt want to be another burden to them. But then I always find myself reconsidering this stance when I‚Äôm sitting at the movie theatre, ready to see a movie that begins at 7:15 with only myself and a text that they‚Äôre not going to get there until 7:30 as company.

My very left wing opinionated friend posted a picture of her iced Capp on her snap story yesterday and on the cup it said ""celebrating 150 years"" and underneath she wrote ""...of genocide"". She is a WOC and she wasn't born here. Am I the only one who finds that extremely inappropriate? Like you knew fully the history of Canada and what it was built upon before you became a citizen. So how can YOU complain about this country's past when you weren't even born here and you still chose to move here. If it bothers you that much then leave.... And don't get me wrong, what happened to the First Nations was SO BAD and I get sad just thinking about it (im not white btw) but like almost every country has a dirty past and we should be proud that Canada has made it to being one of the top 10
Countries to live in. I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this, but if you moved to Canada and it has a better standard of living than your home country and you're STILL complaining, then you need to learn a little about patriotism.
Again, I'm not justifying the torturing and genocide of First Nations, all I'm saying is that if you moved here you shouldn't complain about its past constantly.","#11561

So how can YOU complain about this country's past when you weren't even born here and you still chose to move here. If it bothers you that much then leave.... And don't get me wrong, what happened to the First Nations was SO BAD and I get sad just thinking about it (im not white btw) but like almost every country has a dirty past and we should be proud that Canada has made it to being one of the top 10
Countries to live in. I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this, but if you moved to Canada and it has a better standard of living than your home country and you're STILL complaining, then you need to learn a little about patriotism.
Again, I'm not justifying the torturing and genocide of First Nations, all I'm saying is that if you moved here you shouldn't complain about its past constantly.",,1499041061,,,98,45,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1229180483875943&id=388417724618894,

I recently busted my laptop and needed to use the library computers for my coding work till my new laptop arrived (I would have decided not to buy one IF ONLY sfu library staff were a little more supportive and didn't force struggling students to dump more money). Its been an absolute horror just trying to get a basic python library installed on one of the research commons computer. I've been sending emails everyday to the guy who is supposed to 'help me out' and all he does is send back lame suggestions like ' maybe this is what is happening with that file' . Its kind of your job to come down and figure out what is happening. SFU is paying you for system support not remote mentorship of non-computing science students with drugstore pop psychology on 'its good to be flexible in life'. On one hand SFU has launched this KEY initiative for big data and wants to become the data mining center of the country and on the other hand python is not even working on the library computers.","#11558

In my life, I have made a few friends, many new and many old friends. It is clear who cares about you a lot, who care about you to a certain point only, and who pretends that they care. Some get out of their way and sacrifice a lot of their time to just make sure that I am okay and safe. Some let me know that they are my friends whom I can always count on and call for help when I need something. But, ofc there are some that just obviously doesn‚Äôt really care. Some of my new friends care about me more than my old friends whom ive known for since the beginning of highschool.
However, just the fact that I know I have friends that actually care so much about me really makes me feel so grateful and happy. Their existence makes the fake friends not matter.

Something I want to get off my chest.
I can never be emotional around people. Even when I was little, if I tripped and fell I would start laughing so nobody would see me cry. I guess that's a good thing now, because so often in lecture I want to... but I just sit quietly and hope it goes away.
I had my first panic attack a few months ago, in class. For unrelated reasons, but what really kept it going is the fear that someone would see, that it would show on my face. I was trying so hard to keep things together.
Suddenly I felt myself floating. I could still feel/see/do everything, but it felt like I was just a pair of eyes, and my consciousness was miles away. Like my body, thoughts, and mind belonged to someone else.
My panic faded, but I left the lecture hall like a robot.
It took three days to feel 'normal' again. I guess it was calming, since I could sense my worry but the feeling was not my own. It was such an eerie feeling though...
I still have no idea what the hell that was. I can only hope it doesn't happen again.","#11555

I‚Äôm a first-year on scholarship and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll make it through the last stretch of this term because of family problems. My home situation is not very good.
I recently moved back to my mother‚Äôs home after working and living away for a few years. It‚Äôs been stressful, mostly due to the tensions caused by my sibling.
An incomplete list of things my brother has done:
- Hit my mother, several times so hard she had to go to the hospital or see a doctor
- Accrued thousands of dollars in parking tickets using my mother‚Äôs car, which he often refuses to pay
- Taken the car repeatedly without asking and/or by force, when my mother needs it, leaving her to run after buses to get to work. This is really bad for her because she has terrible chronic pain from breaking her back years ago.
- Stolen cellphone, important documents, car keys, etc. from my mother, mostly to withhold them from her out of spite. The cell phone was a big one because she needed it for work at the time and would have lost her job if she didn‚Äôt scramble to replace it.
- Used my mother‚Äôs credit card without asking and without telling her, which basically amounts to stealing from her
- Been verbally abusive to both me and my mother
- Make fun of me about my autism and during my meltdowns (which 90% of the time are caused by his actions)
- Kicked me and my mother out of the house overnight to throw a party, and lied to his friends saying that we were on vacation (I only found about this when I went back to retrieve my laptop and overheard his friends talking)
- Constantly play terrible music loudly at ungodly hours in the middle of night while he showers
- Bring his friends over to play video games, watch TV, or drink late at night until the wee hours of the morning, which means I can‚Äôt sleep despite how quiet they claim to be (not very quiet when they get excited). My room is connected to the living room by a drafty door and shares a wall with the kitchen. I‚Äôve tried using earplugs, stuffing towels under the door, asking him to be quiet, asking my parents to tell him to be quiet. This happened again Saturday night, when I really needed to sleep to study for finals, and caused the worst autistic meltdown I had in ages.
- Never clean up after himself. This may not be a big deal but it‚Äôs years of him refusing to clean up after himself despite asking and pleading and grounding and a myriad of other things my mother has tried. He makes a mess of the car every time he uses it, leaves uneaten food out like our house is a restaurant, writes on the garage wall in sharpie, breaks doors and other people‚Äôs things in anger, and rarely picks up after himself or his friends. My mother has felt like a slave in her own home for years ever since he came back from my dad‚Äôs, and she‚Äôs just too tired of it all now. She already has so much to deal with because her boyfriend was recently diagnosed with cancer and because of the aforementioned chronic pain. She's not very mentally stable after all she's gone through in her own life, and I don't think she knows how to deal with my brother.
I am worried that he is turning into my father, who was a abusive gambler who stole from, hit, and committed marital rape on my mother. He lived with my father for a while after the divorce. Right now, I don‚Äôt think my brother is a very good person.
I know things probably have been hard on him too (parents divorced, ear injury that causes tinnitus, mental health issues that I‚Äôm not sure he recovered from), but that doesn‚Äôt excuse his behaviour and especially how he treats my mother.
He‚Äôs never lived away from home. Now that he‚Äôs graduating from SFU soon with a Communications degree, maybe he‚Äôll go to graduate school or go away for work and finally live independently. I hope that will help maybe change him for the better--right now living with him is hellish and incredibly stressful.
On top of this, the house itself is hard for me to live in because my mother's boyfriend tried to force sex on me in the living room when I was teen. I know it's messed up that my mother is still with him, but he's the main support she has. I don't have much of a good relationship with my mother too, in part because of her dismissal of what he did, but I still worry over her.
This has become really long. Props if you read through this all. If any other students with bad family situations have any advice on how to cope with it while still attending university and keeping grades up, I would be very very grateful.","#11549

I need to get something off of my chest...
Whenever I watch videos of my childhood I get really emotional. A couple of nights ago I was at my uncle's house with my mom, dad, and sister. He played a few home videos from over 10 years ago and I found myself holding back tears as we sat on the couch while my cousins and I were watching. It made me think of all the good times we had and how we're spending less and less time together because of our busy schedules. (I felt silly at the same time as I was the only one that reacted this way.) I'm looking back at all the instances where my dedication to school got in the way of spending quality time with them. Obviously I signed up to get a higher education, which evidently requires longer periods of time studying or completing assignments. I know that I shouldn't be complaining. Overall I've had an amazing life. But I just feel incredibly sad from time to time when I think about this. Sometimes I regret spending all of that extra time studying and not hanging out with my family...","#11546

This summer I've finally decided to leave SFU, after concictently horrid marks, no matter how much I try or study. In the end I realized that my heart just wasn't in it. I didn't like what I did, I had no passion. I only came here because I could- and because my parents wanted me to go to a top University to get any degree. But that's literally the worst thing you can do, especially for your future. If you do something, you gotta be passionate about it. You have to aim for the top, not aim to pass- which is what alot of people don't understand, and constantly get bad grades, and wonder why. I've decided to follow my own passion, by transferring to Capilano to learn visual design and effects- and to ultimately become an institute computer teacher, since it's what I love and what I'm good at- teaching and designing. Though uncertain, I've got a goal, a plan and a passion.","#11518

Then randomly, a month before finals, they sat on the opposite side of the classroom and flat out ignored me. No smile, no wave, didn't motion for me to come over, nothing. I had literally known both of them for a solid 3 weeks beforehand. I have no idea what the hell I did or why they felt the need to distance themselves so much? I am pretty down about it. Really was only trying to be friends.","#11482

I try my best to make them happy but I just cant. They will be going out of the country soon, so they don't want me to go to SFU and study with my friends so I dont leave my house and dog alone for long (understandable), but when i suggested i get my friends home. I was refused. just plain old ""no"". like what is the matter with them!!??

Many people seem to associate success with drive, but I've found that those two things aren't mutually exclusive. Lately, I've been feeling like I've lost my sense of direction. I'm succeeding in school, I'm an engaged member of the community, I'm doing really cool research, but for what? I can't answer that. I don't know /why/ I'm working so hard, all I know is that I /am/. I'm not sure where I'm going with all these things; I feel aimless. What will my GPA, my achievements, my resume go towards when I'm done school? What am I aiming for? I can't seem to place my own work in a broader context; it just seems like I'm working towards the void. It seems like everyone is more sure about what I want to do than I am.","#11477

Is it just me, or is it completely insane that finals started two days after the end of classes? And there seem to be more finals at the very beginning of the exam period than at any other time... As I sit here, contemplating the six straight hours of exams I have tomorrow, I'm genuinely curious why SFU would think that students wouldn't need more time. UBC goes through until the 28th, so they are far less likely to have multiple exams on the same day or exams in three consecutive days, etc. How is this helping us learn? Especially when the coordination across single departments can be so shoddy. Ugh.","#11471

Students of SFU. Why the fuck are you so messy? Did you never learn to pick up after yourselves... especially after using a communal space? Yes, it's finals season, I get it, stress... but that's not an excuse for eating *insert food* and leaving its wrapper on the floor. It's not just food that comes prepackaged, I've seen bits of orange peel left behind! There's an organic bin roughly every 50ft on Surrey Campus and it's a very similar story in Burnaby too... I can only imagine Harbour Centre is the same. Have some dignity for yourselves and learn to use the goddamn waste bins for your trash. This is especially true after you've spent hours slow-cooking yourselves in a study room. This isn't your bedroom or your crack-den of a house (assuming that's where you reside if you live like this).
If you've always had someone clean up after you, consider this a wake up call. You are the problem.
I expected a little better.
Also, no, I'm not triggered, honestly speaking, just be a decent human being. Not very hard to do.","#11466

All these days in Uni, I've been trying to force my self to be a better student and not be okay with getting below average grades. I just couldn't study anymore, felt lethargic, felt drained, felt BELOW AVERAGE. Today however, something magical happened; something that changed my life. I took a ruler and measured my erect penis length for absolutely no reason at all. It was a solid 0.5 inches above the average. I felt like I had climaxed even though I hadn't. I pulled my pants up, opened my Calculus: Early Transcendentals - 8th edition Stewart textbook and studied for 6 hours straight without blinking or getting any answer wrong. I haven't felt below average ever since.

I've had a pretty rough couple of months, sometimes I wonder how I'm still alive and going. In October I lost one of my best friends suddenly to cardiac arrest. Grief and depression are a bad mix and I became suicidal. I was hospitalized twice in November. Things started to settle down a bit in December, but come January I had to move back home because of conflict between my boyfriend's mother and I (my boyfriend and I were living with her and his brother in Vancouver). My boyfriend is moving out here in May, but it has been very hard being away from him. Things started to settle down again for a few months, but just last week my uncle died from cancer. I'm still not over my best friend's death so I've been grieving in double. And last night my dad kicked out both me and my sister, for no reason other than disagreeing with him. So now I am homeless until my mother comes back from Mexico next week. I just got to SFU and this will be my home for the next few days. I'm still trying though... I will continue to try my hardest in school. Better days are coming I just know it.","#11441

You either have a good looking University on top of fucking Surrey central mall surrounded by a ton of homeless people that might pose a threat to your well being and a campus on top of a depressing mountain that looks like a prison campus. Parties and fun events are hard to find and hearing about nerdy high-school friends getting laid or attending a party or even both by the week at UBC is frustrating. This causes me to have various mood swings, depressing behaviour and overall just bad attitude towards life which wreaks havoc on my academic performance and friendships.

Today on the 143 bus down the mountain, I saw two people (a guy and a girl) sitting across from a girl I know from working on a group project with. Saw this whole thing go down: The girl I know was minding her own business, watching something on her phone.

Today on the 143 bus down the mountain, I saw two people (a guy and a girl) sitting across from a girl I know from working on a group project with. Saw this whole thing go down: The girl I know was minding her own business, watching something on her phone.

Asian men suffer in this society. The kids grow up only to find themselves put in a culture that has made a mockery of them. They turn on television and see themselves depicted as ugly, undesirable and as a result they grow up with a negative image of themselves. While it might be self-validating for people to look around and say ""well it's true"". The secret is that none of this is actually real- these ideas about how penis size matters, etc rather they are only validated by what you see on screen where a director is carefully choosing what is being put out. If asian men developed properly, you would resemble something like this. . . ""I want to be shown for who I really am and not as fiction paints me..."" -Sessue Hayakawa","#11402

Whenever I see someone wearing a Canada Goose jacket, I feel sick to my stomach. Do people who buy these know that the fur trim is made from coyotes? Coyotes are actively killed for their fur, so they can be a fashion accessory on your coat.

I'm 19 and I want to move out. My mom(Chinese) remarried and now I have one younger step-brother and step dad(Chinese). My biological dad passed away due to cancer when I was 18(My biological dad is Caucasian). He knows I have a good career ahead; I'm a kinesiology major. But my mom and step dad doesn't like it, they think I'm wasting my time. Since my mom remarried, every thing changes. She like my step-brother more than me. I feel invisible sometimes when I'm home. Also, my mom think I can't get a job if I study kinesiology or it will be hard. When I turned 19, she forgot to say happy birthday, until the next day. Right now, I feel like I'm falling behind and want to quit school. I don't even want to attend church anymore or go to youth. I haven't been home for a 2 days and live with my close friend.

You know they say no one is perfect but unfortunately I'm far from being no one. Perhaps the reverse. I mean physically (at least).
The number of GFs i ever had in my life and the 15th letter in English alphabet are pronounced the same and you can tell if i was a phone plan i would be something other than Fido or Rogers or Freedom. Forgot the name. You know it.
""My sex life is pretty great"". That's what my right hand would say if he could talk. Don't ask about mine.
You f*ck my life. If only I could do it myself; then I would have better sex life.
I spend a lot of time thinking of the number of f*cks i give especially, and unfortunately, because I'm good with numbers.

I swear every new semester at SFU my exams get longer and longer within the same length time period. 3/4 of my exams this semester has had no one walk out in the whole 1.5 hours. I understand making an exam long so you have to push yourself to finish, but when it's so long that it's physically impossible to finish even when you know everything, it's just stupid.
What's worse is that profs always justify it by saying the class is curved so it doesn't matter, but that shouldn't justify making it so you can't finish 20% of the exam. Not to mention it's frustrating when you know how to do the questions you don't have time to do and it just makes you feel crappy when you can't do them. Also triggers my OCD and anxiety.
And before anyone says I should just get smarter and write faster, I'm usually in the top 20% of marks in the class so yeah.","#11376

To that dick weed clown who thought it was a brilliant idea to flush that white-hair-net-looking-fuckathing into the the 4th toilet stall across from C9001 male washroom.. Your a fuckabish! Like that toilet is my go to toilet when I need to take a dump and you literally made the toilet non permeable where anything that's not water will fucking come right back up. Like dude what were you thinking mannnn. What if I didn't pay attention and took my dump there and flushed it by accident while sitting down.. That woulda been pretty shit. I hope your happy. As I was leaving stall 2, I noticed some guy began occupying that stall 4.. I hope he knows what he's getting into.. Or hopefully he did something about that net thing before starting because..

So I started talking to her, but things got uncontrollable for me within days. It only took a light touch, gorgeous smiles and staring from her during our conversations for me to fall for her. A couple of days of insomnia, and more gorgeous smiles from her drove me mad.
I grew bolder( or you call it insane) and told myself: ‚ÄúWhy not ask for her number?‚Äù With amateur skills, of course, I totally creeped her out, and that‚Äôs the end of this story.
Bad decisions I guess.

I feel really bad because sometimes I forget to say hi to people I know when I'm walking around campus. And it's not because I don't want to or anything, but when I'm walking from place to place, I'm on autopilot. I usually have my headphones in & listening to a lecture, or turning a LONCAPA/assignment/test problem over and over in my head. I'm not present. I'm just letting my legs carry me to where I need to go while my head works on whatever it's working on. And what's even worse is that sometimes I'll make, like, direct eye contact with someone I know, but I don't register them at all. It'll look like I'm looking at them but I don't actually process that I know them, and that I see them, and that I should probably say something. Instead, I'm just looking at them, straight on, and thinking about the role of p53 in apoptosis. I don't know, I just feel bad whenever somebody says: ""hey, I saw you earlier and I waved hi but you never saw me or something"". Sorry friends, I'm just really in my own head.","#11321

Valentines is just around the corner, and here is a dating tip for all you single gals and guys out there from a fourth year Beedie student:
When you ask someone out, it's either they reject or accept (depend completely on your looks),
so that means it's 50/50.
So go for it everyone if you think you have an attractive appearance.
However, 100% success rate even if you look like garbage if you tell them you don't take the bus, but drives a Ferrari or Lamborghini to school. And you don't live in your parents' basement, but you live in the Fairmont Pacific Rim penthouse‚Ä¶. (Trust me this one have a much higher success rate)","#11289

I am super jealous of ENSC/SCI kids who are somehow good at everything. And, yes, I am aware that I sound extremely salty in this, but I just can't help it! How is it that some of these STEM kids can pull 4.0+ GPAs while volunteering, curing AIDS, maintaining 4 jobs, AND colour-coordinating their outfits every single day?? How....does that work??? Do they have more than 24 hours in a day or something? Is there some sort of secret that the rest of the world isn't in on????? What kinda voodoo magic/satanic lord did they sacrifice their afterlives to in order to excel in literally everything they touch and how do I get in on that deal","#11288

Yesterday on the 95 B-line, there was this bus driver that was picking up people from downtown on the way up to SFU. The bus was super packed and people kept coming in even tho it was past the red line. The driver quietly but angrily said, ""Just so you know, those of you riding past the red line is riding against the violation of... and at your own risk. And I can't close the door if I can't see the door."" He lets them on anyways and proceeds to drive. Then he picks up the phone and goes like, ""I need security here tomorrow, I told them they were riding against the violation and I couldn't stop them.""
Man stop with your passive aggressive bullshit and straight up say that's all the passengers you're going to take.

While I was a student, I hated to go to school and do assignments and mostly wrote midterms and finals. Now kinda miss all that.
Group projects were frustrating at times mostly because of the weirdos that I had to deal with every term, but otherwise overall it was great overall.

Now it states that in SFU's rules about redoing a course for the 3rd time, it falls under the decision of the department to allow you to do so. But apparently the econ department denied him retaking the course again! With 118 credits under his belt and only 1 course left to graduate thats a dick thing to do! Why fail so many people when they are so close to graduating? If you wanted to fail people, then make sure you fail more people in econ 201(even though the failure rate is approx 30-40% already). Fuck me if that happens to me. All those years, all those sleeplessness nights for nothing. And I cant pursue my major over 1 damn course. They need to have a better system in place.","#11187

I was waiting at the top loop today after they announced that exams were cancelled. Myself and more that 100 other students were politely notified after waiting 30 mins that the buses weren't coming up to the top. We all had to go down to the middle bus stop. Instead of heading down right away I went into Starbucks to make a call. 15 mins later I noticed that buses were in fact running up to the bus loop, and they were taking students! I managed to get on and get home in a timely manner. But all those poor people who waited half an hour and then walked down and probably waited another hour in that massive line! Shame on you SFU for lying to all those people.","#11130

I have been thinking for a while and it is a hard decision for me. I baptized in 2014 and gave my life to Jesus. The youth group I'm in support me a lot. Until, one day, we go around in circles and ask what was the worst sin I did. There were 12 people. I tried to think what I did bad, until this random guy from the circle just shouted. "" Did I ever had sex?"" Everyone paused and stared at me. I didn't feel comfortable answering. I said, ""Yes I did have sex when I was 16, and me and this girl wore a condom."" I wasn't a Christian back then. Now, they all look at me so strange. This semester has been a roller coaster for me.

It's gotten to a point that I cannot talk about something without them driving the convo to this subject (plus I'm not comfortable with asking a girl out, never did before and don't know how to do it). On the other hand, they also have high expectations when it comes to education. They always want me to get very high marks in everything.
So how is it possible? How does one both have a relationship AND study hard enough to get decent marks? I really want to know if it's possible for two people to be in a relationship and both be able to study together and achieve good results in university.","#10976

****This rant is not specific to SFU, it is about the education system in general**** You know what seriously pisses me off? How superficial university is. What is my professor teaching me that I cannot learn from the internet? I can get better education FOR FREE online. Why is university so useless? Why are professors hired if they obviously have no interest in teaching? Why am I given tests, and failed if i do not meet a certain expectation? I pay for my classes, I should be able to chose what I want out of it. But in all honestly, if employers were open minded, I would not be in university to learn. I would learn by self study (which is exactly what i'm doing, but PAYING TO DO IT).","#10964

I'm honestly so exhausted and fed up with my parent calling me rude and mean names, especially when they do it in public. I've learned the only way to deal with this and feel like I have any shred of decency left is to just be quiet and tell myself mentally that everything will be okay. But these things keep me awake at night and sometimes I just get so distracted from the moment wishing things could be different and that my parents could respect me. On the other hand, I'm obviously grateful that I have a place to live and food and everything I need is provided for me. But the threats and the name calling really have to stop. They happen so randomly too, which makes it super hard to avoid. (Maybe once a month or two months.) And yes I've gone to counselling, which is how I've learned that just staying quiet/calm is what works best in my case. But it doesn't make this any damn easier.

Dear SFU,
How about instead of wasting millions on a student union building (what is it even for?) and finding other bullshit ways to waste your money, you start investing more on the Health and Counselling services you supposedly provide on all campuses, but especially those apart from Burnaby. I am so tired of hearing about a long wait list, no counselling availability, and having to wait three weeks to see a counsellor when I am mentally breaking down RIGHT NOW as I type this confession. I am so close to visiting my high school counsellor because no one at SFU ever has the time. Why am I paying for a medical plan when you can't even provide the services you promised? Sorry for the rant, but it's really hard to ""reach out"" to professionals when there's no one to actually be there to help you.
Sincerely,
A student who is losing faith in this university","#10929

It is with immeasurable sadness that I say my grandmother passed away today.
My whole family was prepared for her departure, but it doesn't hurt any less. No amount of preparation or therapy can prepare you for having family taken from you forever.
She is one of the strongest, most resilient women I know, as she carried the weight of the world on her shoulders. There was never a moment where she put herself ahead of us. She raised a family of five during a time of war and managed to send each and every one of her children to school. Every dollar of her investments went to her grandchildren and making sure they could all go to university. She is part of the reason I am here. Yet, never having been to school herself, she knows more than I do and has read more books than I have. ""Never stop learning,"" she said, ""never stop being curious.""
My grandmother has changed those around her with unconditional kindness and love. She has no idea how many lives she's touched, mine included. Soon she will sleep forever, but I know I will see her again.","#10816

To the two homophobes at the back of the bus who brought tears to my eyes: have an opinion on whatever topic you would like by all means, nobody can take that away from you. But please, please refrain from using sentences that make homosexuals around you feel uncomfortable, unwanted, sad, alone, and abnormal. ""Faggots aren't real people"", ""they chose to be a fag"", ""faggots aren't worth anything"", ""they don't deserve a home"". When people in a full 135 bus are around you, respect that physical homosexual stereotypes may not be all that define a homosexual. You can't assume that nobody there isn't gay. Some of us have had to live lonely lives because our own parents have disowned us due to who we fall in love with. I respect your right to have an opinion, but keep it to yourself, in an enclosed space. It's already tough for most of us, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who would appreciate not being called a monster.

I am lactose intolerant but I didn't know I was until about 5 years ago (I am 26). All my life, I wasn't allowed to have chocolates, milk, chocolate milk, cake, dessert, ice cream... basically, all the good shit everyone loves. Couldn't even have cookies!! I thought something was seriously wrong with me because how come I was the only one who had raunchy, deadly gas from just a cone of ice cream? I was ashamed and hid my condition and just told everyone I don't like chocolates or ice cream, etc.
I found out what lactose intolerant means after working in a cafe during university and I felt so relieved that I wasn't the only one. I couldn't believe how common it is and how many people have the same dairy restrictions as me!! Today, when someone offers me something heavy on dairy, I will look at them in the eye and say, ""No thanks. I don't wanna shit myself for the rest of the day."" #nomoreshame","#10808

I had my first session today and found out that if I want to continue to use the services I need to be enrolled in the courses. What the heck kinda system is that?! I need a break to deal with depression, which is the reason I'm seeking counselling. I've paid for the services for three years. I was a full-time student for the rest of the year. They did recommend me other resources I can use off-campus, but that's not the point. It's hard to accept that you need help, that you are not strong enough, that your plan did not work out.

As far as I know, I have seen two grown female and 2 baby racoons walking around campus convocation area. These racoons may attack you if you get too close to them in fear of you trying to harm their babies. I urge you to keep your distance. I was photographing these guys from 30 feet away and they appeared to be disturbed. I saw some guy getting as close as 2 feet to get a selfie. I am afraid that one day that racoon is gonna attack someone and therefore the school would be forced to remove them from campus or have them euthanized.

I am so confused. For the past year and a half I've been trying to either convince myself that ADHD is a real illness and I have it or that I‚Äôm fine and I just need to try and work harder. I know I should just go see a doctor and let them do their job, but it's hard to convince a doctor to give you a referral (to a psychiatrist) when you yourself aren't completely convinced of it. Honestly, I'm just scared of bringing up ADHD to anyone right now, justifiably so, I believe: I've been to four doctors, FOUR and no luck in getting referral or any kind of evaluation so far. A couple of those doctors even laughed and said something along the lines of ADHD being bullshit. I wish I never heard of ADHD...or at least never did any research on it; it was much easier to justify my actions and behaviour with me just being an idiot instead of an underlying mental health issues.","#10663

Today was quite a unique experience as I noticed a Pokemon was nearby while up at SFU and I of course went to pursue it. While I was deeply focused on the chase and staring at my phone, I didn't notice the bush shaking and in turn the bear that stepped out from behind it. Of course this all came as a shock to me as I was so focused on finding a a virtual Pokemon but instead I found a real Pok√©mon!!!
This game is clearly more dangerous than I expected and I guess this should be considered a warning to all who play Pok√©mon Go especially at SFU.","#10660

Then residence gave me a level 5 for no reason and said that I manage wrongly the situation.

In light of the Standford swimmer's case, my father has become over paranoid. He had always been the type, being a traditional Korean, telling me ladies must be modest, etc, no make up and all, and men and women don't mix and the likes. Now, I wanted a skirt for my up coming job interview, he told me not to whore myself up. That makes me sad. Hell, if a perverted wanted to do something, skirt or pants won't make a damn difference. Now, mind you, the skirt I wanted was knee length. This type of misogyny is irksome to say the least.
He told me I wasn't mature enough to make decisions myself.
The same day, he had told me I needed to be more mature and stop fooling around at school and stop being so dumb. He told me to start learning, start thinking about my career. and by learning he meant learn computer science, and get a job. (I'm a education undergrad).
This doesn't make sense. I'm not mature enough to dress myself but I'm mature enough to get a career????

Today, a guy asked me to be a model for a fashion show.

I dated a girl which was my first true love. I really loved her for who she was, but she had an ex. When we were together there was always her ex trying to get back with her. But I always knew in my back if mind that she still loves him and I was her rebound. I dated her for almost 3 years and during the end of our relationship she came up with a reason to break up with me. I didn't give up I kept telling myself there was a way to work things out. But when I found out she cheated on me I didn't know what to do. I literally went home and sat in my room for a week. I'm over her, and on with my life with another girl. But the only thing that's not making me committed is that i don't want the same thing to happen ever again. Like I said I would never cheat on someone but she was biggest the regret of my life.

I have a bit of an issue and I went to a Career advisor to talk about it, who sent me to talk to a Beedie advisor, who sent me to talk to a SIAT advisor, who sent me to talk to a Beedie advisor again, who sent me to talk to a General advisor, who sent me to talk to the Registrar, who then sent me to talk to the Admissions people.
My problem has still not been resolved even after all this running around. Nobody seems to know WTF to do.

As of right now, I'm really conflicted about what classes I should keep and what classes I should drop. The reason why I'm so conflicted is because I don't want to drop my GPA.
So this leads me to wonder, is having a good GPA really that important? I'm not planning to get into med school or grad school but I'm still really hesitant to take electives that lower my GPA. Every semester, I freak out about whether I should take a class or not because it might lower my GPA. I have a high enough GPA to continue getting the open scholarship at SFU but it's not really high enough for anything else. So I'm wondering, aside from that scholarship, is there any real advantage to keeping this GPA? I'm trying my best not to care but I can't help it. I don't want to see my GPA drop. Should I still care? I know so many people who aren't going to grad school after SFU but still stress out about grades. Why do you stress out about your GPA? If people didn't care about GPA and only cared about passing, university would be a lot more fun.","#10540

Today after my exam, I walked up to the SFU bus loop to take the 145 bus. I then got on at the back door and sat down at the back corner. While waiting for the bus to leave, I looked out the window and saw 4 Transit Security officers standing around. I suddenly realized I forgot to tap my compass card and quickly got up to tap it. 2 minutes later when the bus was about to leave, these officers boarded the bus and started scanning everyone's compass cards. Of the 30 or so students on the bus, 6 did not tap their compass cards and were kicked off the bus. The officers then asked them for the IDs and started writing infraction tickets. Good thing I realized before it was too late or I would have gotten a $173 fine. Even though the 145 bus rarely gets fare checks, I learned my lesson and will remember to tap my compass card when boarding through the middle and back doors.","#10458

It's been 1.5 years since the break up and sometimes I can still feel pain when I'm alone at night.
My ex and I dated for almost 8 years. We had issues but nothing major. Most of our friends thought we would get married. My ex was an extremely kind and considerate person. I guess that makes what he did to me extremely difficult to accept. We had a couple fights near the end of the relationship and he decided to cheat on me with a girl he just met. I couldn't find closure after that. I admit that I made mistakes and I could have cared for him more instead of staying so focused with schoolwork. But why couldn't he talk to me before doing something he would regret? His friends don't think he did anything wrong. But can cheating really be justified? How do I get closure?","#10443

I don't cry much when watching tv shows/movies. It's not that I don't feel for the characters, but the situations that they're placed in are just not ones I can level with. But when I watched the parents episode of Masters of None, I don't recall a single second when I wasn't bawling my eyes out.

I used to think that I am a man full of lust.
Today I found out that I was wrong.
While washing my hands at males' washroom, a guy came in and grab a piece of paper towel.
I thought to myself: Why would a man need paper towel with dry hands?
The answer became clear when I heard the familiar sounds: Fixed Action Patterning!
I soon leave the washroom to give the man some privacy.

Remote conferencing is ruining University group work.
People think that an ongoing FB chat or a Skype call is a substitute for sitting in the same room. It's absolutely not. It's an excuse for people to phone in their effort, making some Frankenstein's monster of a project made from 3-5 pieces of half-assed work that doesn't match. You usually have some poor teammate struggling to work 5 pieces of garbage into something good... or you just hand in trash.
It's also something that's going to get crowded out of a student's schedule by the in-person meetings and other obligations that they do have. Real meetings always take priority over fake ones. We all know people are ignoring the chat most of the time, dipping in occasionally to do a little token ""work"". It's not a real group workflow.
Next time your group has decided on a remote conferencing workflow, think twice. You've now been warned that it's a one way ticket to mediocrity. Use it as a supplement to ongoing IRL meetings, or don't use it at all.","#10375

While I was sitting in the skytrain staring out, I could see the reflections of the other people on the train since it was dark outside. From a window further down, I saw the reflection of an old man staring at me. He was so still and stared at me without blinking. I thought it was pretty odd, but waited until he would look away. Thing is, he kept staring at me. His face was unnaturually stiff too, like he wouldn't move a muscle. He just stared at me with deep penetrating eyes. Everytime I looked away and looked back, he was still staring at me. This was really starting to creep me out. After a while, I turned around to see where he was sitting, but then my dumbass realized his face was a picture on an advertisement poster.","#10317

This one really bugs me. Women always say men should open the door or give up their seat on the bus or whatever. Without thinking I always open the door or just leave it open if I'm the first one through. The least you can do is say ""thank you"" rather than pretending like your some queen and it was expected. Ignorant women eh? (particularly with the brown girls at SFU Surrey). Anyways, from now on, I'm just going to smack the door on your face. Good bye","#10248

Every semester it gets harder and harder for me to actually CARE. Of course I want to do well- I'm not good at failing (especially if I'm paying out the wazoo for someone to judge my work) but I can't help but feel like every assignment is left until the last minute because I only care at the last minute if it's done! Truth be told: I want to work my ass off and then travel the world. I've been to so many beautiful places that I just feel like I'm wasting my life away trying to get a piece of paper I don't care to use in the future. Honestly if I end up being a server in the middle of the UK somewhere, single and living in a stupidly expensive flat, I will be happier than I am at an amazing school, in a beautiful apartment, because in that case I would actually feel like I've DONE something. I want to write my own story but I feel like SFU is forcing me to make 4 years of edits just to throw a bad GPA in my face or withhold my grades until they can play nice with the TA's -.-","#10237

My sister and I don't get along very well. We don't chat too often or call eachother up, and I've given up since it usually ends up in an argument when we do. She was in the hospital recently and I wouldn't have known if it wasn't for my mom telling me. I reached out to see how she's doing but instead she just bitched about how I never call her, otherwise I would have known how she's doing and that she was in the hospital for the second time this week. It took all my energy not to tell her that she never calls me herself either; so if the roles were reversed, she'd be a hypocrite. But I kept shut. I didn't call her to fight. I called to let her know that I love her and that I wished I knew so that I could have been there, but I didn't even get a chance to say that. She was in the hospital for something serious and all I really wish for is that we could just learn to get along. I'm jealous of my friends who are best friends with their siblings, but I don't know if that will ever be a possibility for us.","#10215

[#20173] Yesterday I was on the bus doing some typical errands and a Syrian family got on the bus a few stops later, no I know they were Syrian because they were with an aid who was showing them how transit works and what not. The bus had an engine problem and it sputtered a little bit and then made a huge pop, and there two children started screaming and the mother threw herself on top of them like a shield. They thought it was gunshots. Now to be honest I was completely against the refugees coming here but my heart fucking broke into pieces seeing the sheer terror on their faces. No one deserves to live in a state of constant fear and my perspective has definitely changed. I really hope we can make life better for them as the sheer ignorance is just making it worse.

When I had finished my business (numero uno for those interested), I had to walk right by the person waiting to enter my stall. I wanted to apologize, and let everyone know that I DIDNT DO IT but I'm sorry üòû

I‚Äôve had social anxiety since I was about 13 years old, a good day for me is one in which I don‚Äôt think about harming myself. Beyond having social anxiety I‚Äôm a good student academically, have a great social circle, and always try to help my community in any way possible. I also have been recently making great strides in dealing with my anxiety and have been able to string some ‚Äúgood days‚Äù together. One symptom of my SA is that I always stare at people for no apparent reason, combined with the fact that I‚Äôm scared and nervous in public. This culminates into me scarily and nervously staring at people who I like have a loose connection with for whatever reason, a lot of the time because I‚Äôm not sure if I should say ‚Äúhi‚Äù to them or not. In recent times I‚Äôve being doing this a lot less as I‚Äôve come to better understand it. This leads me to three points;
1) I‚Äôm not staring at you because I‚Äôm attracted to you.
2) I‚Äôm not scared or nervous because of you; it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm in public and have SA.
3) If it bothers you please talk me about it, and I‚Äôll be glad to explain it to you.","#9991

How to make more money on textbooks in two ways:
1. Two people bought textbooks at the bookstore for $175. Next term they sell their textbooks. If one sells $50 and the other for $75, people will fluctuate towards the cheaper price, thus driving the overall sale price down. However, if both people (representing all book sellers) set their price at $100, no price competition, everyone forced to buy at $100.
2. Buy textbooks from people that don't want to go through the trouble of selling textbooks. Once gained critical amount (for example holding 90% of all second hand books), sell them at standardized price.","#9954

So the first night of 2016 I had a huge fight with my boyfriend. He believes we are not good for each other because he doesn't believe I am a patient person and will stay by his side through the bad times and we will have lots of problems in the future (especially because I am about 8 years younger than him). I asked him to be more patient and give me some time to prove him that I truly love him and will do anything for him. He told me he has already gave up and if it was up to him he would break up right now but he will wait more for me. He also told me he doesn't see me in his life in the future (we talked about marriage before but he told me he doesn't think about this with me anymore).
I am so lost and broken inside but I am willing to be patient and do the best I can to change his mind since I love him.","#9943

To the guy in black on the 20 around 230 am;
THANK YOU for distracting the drunk guy who kept asking me creepy personal questions. Thank you for making conversation with him in hopes to get him to leave me alone. Especially after everything that happened in Paris today, when he questioned me about being Canadian (which I am, but why should that matter?) I was genuinely scared and didn't know what to do. Thank you for being brave enough to get him to stop swearing at me, and accusing me of lying and being untrue. Thank you for getting him to leave me alone. I wanted to say thank you when you were getting off the bus, but I was too shaken up even though you smiled and told me to have a good night. You made me feel like someone was looking out for me. And to the other guys on the bus and the driver, thank you for making sure the ""drunk"" guy got off the bus where he said he needed to. You all made my trip home feel safe once again.
Sincerely, a scared female who you helped feel safe and secure on transit again.","#9604

TO SEEK A REFUGE
A lifeless body has washed up ashore
A harmless angel leaves in peace
The battle resumes as engines roar
Engines of tanks in cities of deceased.
The death toll rises as time ticks
As refugees look for temporary haven
But life back home makes them sick
The war has left civilians shaken.
Poverty is a burden detested by all
Survival is a goal but death is imminent
Freedom is denied as refugees are appalled
Why has humanity become so ignorant?
It's a matter of choice for salient measures
A peaceful settlement is the real treasure.","#8925

wow k super duper confession time: I used to be ashamed of being chinese. Like, i used to really, really want to be white. And this wasn't recent, this was before I even realized that race was a problem in Canada (grade 2 or 3 ish). I used to wonder why my hair was so black and my nose was so flat and why my eyes were so brown. And it sucks that i was so willing to just rid myself of my culture because on a deep deep level, white people had won. They had convinced me that my race was gross and ugly and that I should be ashamed of it. My parents left everything they knew and everyone they loved and made millions of sacrifices to come to a country that made fun of their accent and rejected their traditions so that i could have a better life, and here i was, with my apathy towards learning cantonese and hatred for the people.
After everything my parents went through, they had to watch this country rob them of their children.","#8671

I was in the class of 2015 to graduate and he never showed up at the convocation. He also didn't congratulate me. He is younger to me and works a labor job and I work an office job matching my degree.
He breaks up with me right after graduation saying he can't be with me. He resented my success, my education, my lifestyle.. How do you date someone like that?! Well, glad it all ended and now I can focus on my job and my life out of university.","#8475

There's a part of one of my favourite books, where in desperation, one of the characters orders her mutant dogs to kill a giant invulnerable monster so she can save her friends. Most of the dogs died, and she crudely carved their names into the memorial after the attack. Only her and a few others knew the loyalty of these dogs, others saw their names in the memorial as graffiti.
Sometimes, I feel like I'm one of these dogs. That even though I try my best in everything I do, that any of my great accomplishments will only be seen as a joke or forgotten after I'm gone. I feel like sometimes my friends take me for granted or don't care about me. Like a dog, I feel like I'm being used for loyalty and affection, and sometimes I wonder if that's all I have to offer this world. I wish that I had more time to spend with my friends, and that my partners weren't so allergic to commitment. Here's a dog picture I found off of reddit to thank those who read this.","#8307

Men are naturally programmed to want more than one woman, despite being in a monogamous relationship. They are programmed by nature to want variety, indeed endless variety. It only takes a split second for a man's attention to be caught by another woman, he is likely to have forgotten her just a few seconds later when she has disappeared from view. And this is why men in relationships still check out other women.","#8247

Without realizing it, I've been building up a harem. No, not the kind where I have many children with several wives who compete and raise their son to be the future Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. I mean like the romantic comedy anime kind. I've somehow gotten the ability to have more than one girl interested in me at a time (I'm pretty sure this has never happened to anyone else before).
Anyways, so far I have the childhood friend and the kuudere. I'm not sure where to find the tsundere, dandere, yandere, genki girl, etc. How do I meet more women who's personalities conform to those of stereotypical anime characters?","#8243

The man who transformed Singapore single handedly into a highly developed country from a fishing village is on his deathbed. He ruled with an iron fist and has always been controversial and i have never liked him. But looking back now, i feel that had it not been for him and his extreme methods and bad ass persona, Singapore could have been royally screwed. We have the most stupidest of laws (chewing gam is banned) and it is one of the most expensive cities in the world right now but even then, its a place i call home and without Lee Kuan Yew, i don't know how bad our lives would have been. As bad as he may have been, he is one of the top leaders that the world has seen.
The video shows some of his views that have been controversial and just how tough he was.

I find it really irritating that people get mad at those who hunt, but don't think about the meat that they buy at the store. If we stand against big corporations that test cosmetics on animals, or big factories that murder thousands of animals that have never seen the sun on a daily basis, we can make the world a better place. We need to put our money where our mouths are and only purchase cruelty free products and free range meat and animal byproducts from local free range sources. We need to be fighting the big companies not the occasional hunter. Hit the big where it hurts, their bottom line.","#7028

For the last few days I am looking for a place to live on craigslist and some of the preferences from the owners made me little upset. For example, female only or whites only or Chinese/ Filipino only or people from some other countries only. I asked some of them why they don't share their houses with males and they gave me all sorts of gender based stereotypes like males are more noisy, untidy and they will feel unsafe. I really wanted to move in to a place which is in a nice location but the owner asked me for more money for being a male! Then yesterday I came across a place where the owner wants male only since she (female herself) believes that a female would distract other males in the house. I wish all these sexist SOBs step on a lego piece and when they retreat in agony they step on another.","#7027

It's important to know that people who are suffering are just humans like you but you don't have to be part of the stigma that comes attached with it!

I understand funding and budgets are tight at SFU, but some things really need to be done.
SIS Labo 3 (AQ 2109) was flooded out leaving students and faculty in scramble and panic modes Tuesday morning, with three weeks or less remaining to finish the rest of our labos and projects. I was on the receiving end of e-mails all day from my professors and the Department of Geography (I have two labos in that room) and meanwhile had to endure a remote sensing labo anyway, which was relocated and caused us nothing but stress and problems. As well, we've lost several machines to the flood, the only machines in the school equipped for our purposes, as well as 24 hour access to these machines until at least next week. Considering Tuesday is a holiday and these classes of mine run on Tuesday, I'm really stressed out and worried.
I hope all of you had better days than I did!

2 years ago I was studying the night before my O Chem final with a couple of friends. It ended up getting really late, my guy friend was already planning on staying in my townhouse room and sleeping on the floor. Since it was really late, I offered the girl to stay sleep at my place and that we would figure out sleeping arrangements later. We ended up going back to my place and I was studying in my bed with the girl. When my friend went to the bathroom I made a move and we started making out. I ended up fingering her while my friend slept on the floor that night and ended up cuddling all night. I could not get any sleep! When it was morning, my friend went to shower, but this time I grabbed a condom and we started to have sex. After I cummed in her, I realized when I pulled out that I was not wearing the condom anymore. It fell off.... I was freaking the fuck out!!! She was not on birth control and we had the final in a couple hours. It was the most stress I have ever felt in my life and the result was that I had to endure ultimate walk of shame to the pharmacy at Nester's...","#5993

Being the person who posted about getting a 9/30 on my first midterm, this made me feel more at ease I guess. Maybe I won't be placed on AP after first year after all.
For anyone who is still having difficulty in transitioning to university, what I found most helpful is the instant that you know what your problems are, whether it be academic or anything else, get help as soon as you can. Don't wait ""till tomorrow"" or be prideful, and in my case lazy, if your goal is to do well in school or at least finish your undergrad. There are so many resources out there and they are here for a reason, put them to good use. Good luck to everyone in completing the rest of your midterms!","#5812

I had been studying so well until these inconsiderate fucks enter one of the labs with no books/study-material on them and start playing multiplayer games with endless mouse-clicks per minute and chit chatting. Being one of those, who cannot study with earphones on, I find this extremely frustrating. Since it's not a quiet study area, it's totally understandable if someone's discussing academic material but this is insane! Firstly, you let someone to enter the lab (which probably means you don't have access) and second, you get there when people are studying for their finals and start playing games right in the row directly ahead of them which is so distracting. If you don't have finals or feel too smart to study for them, let others study!

Based on all the confessions about other first year students struggling and are about to be on academic probation, has helped me not feel so alone. I basically got all 'D's in my classes. I was so unmotivated and this is was the result; I deserved it. Hopefully getting these shitty grade will help me next semester feel more motivated in school. I don't even know what I want to do in life or even major in. It's sad to see, all the money I earned go to waste. This is a lesson learned.
Can you guys recommend me some GPA boosters please! I'll definitely be taking school in the summer to make up for the units I lost. Goodbye summer :(
To everyone on academic probation, I wish you best of luck! Let's get out of this mess together. Your not the only one who messed up","#2111

People around me seem to think I'm smart and get good grades. In reality, I think I failed two of my courses this semester. I cant bring myself to tell anyone. I feel stupid.
I used to be a good student in high school with my AP classes and 90 average. Now I'm below a 3.0 GPA. I keep telling myself to work harder and study like I did in high school. Instead I lose focus and spend hours doing nothing but shuffling my notes and staring at one page in my book. My intentions are there...but I can't carry them out.

I usually don't get dreams/nightmares but when I do they are usually extremely weird and scary. Last night's dream/nightmare was no exception...it scared the sh*t out of me because it was super whack...like all dreams/nightmares. I don't remember all the details but I was getting bullied/attacked by a few girls at my old house. I managed to chase after one of the girls and damn idk what happened, but I got really mad at her. I just threw a dumbbell at her LOL and did a small light punch on her arm. Then all of a sudden she corners me and touches her lips against mine. I told her...""this for reals or this just for jokes?"" and she just went all in and then I woke up.
The good part about this? She exists as a friend/coworker and wifey material. The bad part? There is none ;P

Confession: God, I swear, any time someone mentions race at all even if it's just their observations and they aren't necessarily being judgemental, there will always be the people who are deeply offended and claim that OP is racist, small minded, ignorant, etc. and the list goes on. Gee, maybe they really just noticed -insert race- doing something more than other people and wanted to say something about it.

Confession: God, I swear, any time someone mentions race at all even if it's just their observations and they aren't necessarily being judgemental, there will always be the people who are deeply offended and claim that OP is racist, small minded, ignorant, etc. and the list goes on. Gee, maybe they really just noticed -insert race- doing something more than other people and wanted to say something about it.

I went to take a sip, and the lid came off and the coffee spilled all over my white shirt and the ground. I had no tissues on me, and felt like I was going to burst into tears. No one stopped to help me, except this one guy who took out a pack of tissues and cleaned the entire mess up for me. When I looked up, he was gone. I never got to say thank you.

confession: I was walking through the AQ and spotted myself one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen but only obtaining a quick glimpse of her face. The stalking began at 10:34 am, she was walking with her friend in front of me, my objective to see her face again such that i can remember it forever. I begin to power walk in order to get ahead of her, drawing closer and closer, and my heart pounding faster and faster, just a second away from seeing her cute face, until it happened.. I smacked into the corner of a table(where a book selling event was occurring), and noticed a few people looking at me.... boy did i feel red faced. i straightened myself out to get back on track of my objective but to my unfortunate demise, she was gone...., her face forever lost and my dreams once again to be filled with boyish desires with no love to fill the gaps. :(","#1565

After wearing a costume to Halloween, I think some people need to realize that people who wear costumes, don't bite. If you want to take a picture of/with them, just ask. I had way too many people trying to awkwardly sneak a picture of me in the costume with their phones, although I admit it was mildly amusing to see people try to hide the fact. Just ask, I'm pretty sure people who are wearing a costume would be very happy to do so.

I find you so damn interesting, and perfect in every way. You are the guy whom I always dream about. You are so damn funny, and I find you so cute. When we talk , I get more and more attached to you. I want to get to know you more, and I want to be friends.. for the start . I wish I could approach you at school and come and say Hi. I'm scared to talk to you in person, or ask to hangout, because I'm not sure how you feel about me. If you are reading this , and might know who it is, please try to bring it up when we talk. I feel like I'm always annoying you , because I'm always the first one to start the conversations. However, I can never get you of my mind. I always want to keep on talking to you.
Sincerely,
First Year Student.",,1381200144,,,6,1,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=394070504053616&id=388417724618894,
