After waiting for two hours to talk to academic advising, my advisor had the nerve to mock me and laugh at me for making questions about my academic probation. I asked her about the possibility of switching faculties and what the requirements are/ asking her for ADVICE ( which I now realize is too much to ask for... from an academic ADVISOR) she basically chuckled the whole time, almost laughing at the questions I had. Her tone was so condescending and rude. After she answered basically none of my answers I told her she was being fucking rude and told her how insensitive it was to laugh at me over something as important as coming off academic probation (my likelihood of staying in uni) when she’s making me feel like I’m asking stupid questions. What happened to there’s no such a thing as a stupid question lady? she immediately changed her tone and apologized saying it wasn’t her intention etc. At this point I’m so fucking done with UBC I willingly want to transfer to SFU...","#13178

My girlfriend has this strange request. She asks me to cum in her mouth everyday while she's sleeping. It's her fetish to wake up with the taste of cum in her mouth. When she wakes up, she'll usually be so horny that she gives me a blowjob. To be honest, I'm getting pretty tired of wanking it every night at 1am (she usually sleeps at midnight or so).
Do you reckon I should stop?","#13177

What I think people who are not in the Greek System need to understand is that partying isn't just something we do. It's ingrained into our lives. Many people, these days, are perfectly content with sitting on their computers all day playing video games. I used to be a competitive gamer and I used to do this. After joining the Greek system, partying became a new norm that was ingrained into my life. We need it for our wellbeing. It helps us escape society. There have even been studies that show how necessary gatherings are for our wellbeing. The fact that it was stripped away from us, especially by something that barely affects us specifically is very detrimental to our mental state. People are giving us so much crap for it, yet they don't know what it's like for us to be deprived of everything that's fun for us.","#13174

This is a follow up to #13151. I didn't leave UBC Confessions some way of verifying my identity unfortunately, so it will be hard to verify that I am the same person. That said, if no one else posts a follow up between #13151 and this post, it would be pretty good evidence on its own that I am the same person.
Moving on, I have not been contacted for potential cheating and my final has been graded. Therefore, I think I'm safe. There are two things I used to accomplish this: virtual machine running Google Chrome + notes in a collated, easily searchable format. (This paragraph works as a TLDR I guess.)
I would have probably borderline failed this final without cheating because I didn't actively keep up with the class. That said the course could have probably been taught in a week, and the kinds of questions asked made it possible to learn the course content during the final. But now I got an A, which is infinitely better than I thought I'd do. Again like I said the first time, cheating is immoral, and there was no reason to let myself get to the point where I felt I needed to cheat.
So now's the time for the big question: how did I do it?
Well first things first, if I'm not using an external monitor or a phone or the like, then the options are limited to having notes hidden strategically. Virtual machines are a pretty simple way to accomplish this task. They are hard to configure, but I planned well in advance and set it up back in March. Further I used GNOME Boxes, which made the set up a lot easier than if I used Hyper-V or something similar. I suspect VirtualBox would be fairly simple to configure and works on Windows/Mac/Linux, but don't quote me on that.
However the virtual machine is set up, the cool thing is that you can split your laptop/desktop screen with the virtual machine and your notes, and the virtual machine does not have access to your laptop's hardware unless you allow it. In my case I only redirected the webcam to the virtual machine. The biggest problem is not having enough RAM for it. I used a Ubuntu virtual machine since my laptop only has 8 GB of RAM total, and Ubuntu requires less RAM to run than Windows. In terms of glances being recorded, as long as you are largely facing your screen (which you will be doing a lot of to read your notes), it should be fine.
Because of the limited RAM I had, I could only have one thing open in addition to my virtual machine. I had a LibreOffice document consisting of all the course's notes from the beginning to the end of the term, which made searching through really quick. I added to this doc regularly - I had reminders set up to remember to copy the content over. Initially it was because I didn't like the format they appeared in on Canvas, but closer to the end of the course, it was done primarily to set myself up for cheating.
Now only a select number of people actually use Linux as their primary operating system, so getting GNOME Boxes is out of the question for many people. That said virtual machines aren't impossible to create, just that it's laughably easy with GNOME Boxes. Instead of LibreOffice though something like Google Docs/Microsoft Word/Microsoft Word Online could work too. Further not every course uses the lowest possible levels of learning, particularly remembering and understanding. In addition, 8 GB RAM laptops are fairly common, which then make using a virtual machine particularly tasking on the computer hardware. Linux is also not the most user friendly operating system out there. Unfortunately this may become an exploit for the rich or technologically adept. Further, if there's some way to detect the usage of a virtual machine from within a Chrome tab, this exploit will disappear, though it would likely be pretty difficult to tell conclusively.
For students, please avoid classes that use Proctorio, especially if it's some elective that relies on memorization. Cheaters and Proctorio haters will find their way, and in addition Proctorio is a privacy nightmare.
As for UBC, you should rethink your contract with Proctorio, given that it doesn't even do it's job anyway, and is only a few steps away from violating BC's FIPPA laws assuming it hasn't already.
For professors/course coordinators/undergrad chairs, please find ways to avoid Proctorio. Collaborate Ultra works just as well for invigilation, and if for some reason Collaborate Ultra is not usable, there's Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Slack, and even Zoom, which are all much more privacy compliant than Proctorio and equally as useful for invigilation. Further a high quality test that actually depends on your ability to analyze/evaluate/synthesize relevant situations to the course content makes a test that is cheating resilient.","#13172

This is going to be my final year at UBC, when I started I wanted do a honors project in my last year. I worked hard for it, getting to know profs, maintaining good grades, only to learn that UBC is planning on not letting undergrads in labs to do an honors project. I feel defeated, all this effort I put was for nothing. Going into debt to complete my education, so at least I wanted to make the most out of it. But of course, why should the university care about these couple of students who want to do more? When they sent out a list of courses going to be conducted in person, why weren't honors courses included in that? There's just a handful of students who would be doing an honors, if you can let some courses be held in person, why not do that for honors as well, why cancel it completely?

So... I just registered for classes and can now see the breakdown of this years tuition fees and what the fuck is UBC actually thinking with some of this years fees!? Let's get the obvious topic out of the way. I don't care that they are keeping class fees the same, everyone is complaining but honestly that is not where the problem rests. Let's begin with ""Athletics and Recreation Fee, $230.82"". No one is on campus, most facilities are closed why the fuck am I paying for this. UBC seriously doesn't have enough money to fund this themselves even if they have to slightly postpone one of their three hundred active construction projects for a couple months?! And then there are smaller fees that still grind my gears like the ""Childcare Bursary Fund"" and the ""Student Spaces Fund"" or the ""Bike Kitchen"". I might have understood these fees if we were having in person classes and we could actually use student spaces or the bike kitchen but why the fuck am I paying for this while 300 miles away from UBC. Teachers are working from home so who am I paying childcare for and why? And then there is ""Campus Culture & Performance"", which again, if we aren't on campus why am I paying for this? Why couldn't UBC simply change their fees for at least one semester and let me and my family save some hard earned money instead of paying for pointless shit??

PSA: Your student representatives are cheating their way into medical school
Recently I’ve been enlightened by exactly how rampant cheating is in online courses. This is seriously discouraging to me as someone who’s worked extremely hard this past year to raise their average in an honest way when cheating premeds are just inflating the course averages and discrediting our work. Honestly I won’t even say that I’m surprised because we all know cheating is a thing at UBC and premeds can be toxic af, but I’m disappointed that this bunch of resume-padding snakes feel the need to cheat in their GPA-booster classes just to have that “perfect” cookie-cutter profile for UBC Med. I really don’t see the appeal of giving up your academic integrity just to score a few percentage points higher on an exam, but I guess medical school is competitive enough that people feel the need to cheat. It just seems counterproductive when the courses they’re taking now have material that’s applicable to future courses, so not bothering to learn it now just hurts them in the long run.
Also, scary that these people will probably get into med school and become our next generation of doctors. Guess I’m just not getting sick in ~10 years, I’d rather die than let any of these docs touch me with a 10-foot pole.","#13161

As I approach my my fourth and final year here at UBC, I can't stop worrying about my pending graduation and upon that, being flung into the unknown of finding a job in a suffering economy, digging hard into my savings to pay bills and migraine medication (who the hell made it so expensive), and lying to my parents that I'm doing alright. I believe that I was born into debt, and that I cannot go just yet until I've paid it in full to my parents who have brought me up this far. So sometimes when I feel like everything and everyone is too much, I hop into Animal Crossing and I feel that this temporary virtual escape helps me lots. My villagers remind me that I matter and loved, my online friends who let me know when there's a meteor shower and join me in watching the shooting stars, Daisy Mae who comes by with her drippy nose to sell turnips... Roscoe for being the biggest lovable grump... People I've never met in real life bringing nice things to me when they visit my island... A big shoutout to the UBC AC community. Thank you for this massive community, you have no idea how much this supports me.","#13160

My experience with two design teams this year sucked.
First design team: I was assigned to a project along with an upper year who had been on the team for a while. Since I was new, I had to do some setups on my laptop and read documentation to get caught up. Meanwhile, the upper year started on the project without me and without communicating with me. When I reached out to see if we could work together, he told me to keep reading docs. I didn’t get a chance to learn or help out. To be fair, it isn’t his job to mentor me or hold my hand, I guess. As a newbie, it just felt condescending, even if he wasn’t trying to be. Additionally, the culture of the team felt clique-y and exclusive.
I left the first team for the second, partly because of the first team’s culture, partly because the second team was doing something more related to my interests.
Second design team: had no culture at all; none of the members socialized. They had an initiation challenge where the learning curve was so steep, most new members, who weren’t familiar with the technology used in the challenge, still hadn't completed it by the end of the school year. I haven’t completed it either and I am disappointed that I didn’t get to contribute anything the whole year. I don’t even know what the team has managed to accomplish this year? Communication and activity within the team was minimal, and since COVID, has completely stopped.
I’m not sure if I should do design teams again. It’s disappointing because I really wanted to get involved and build cool stuff but I guess I’m just either unlucky or a bad team member.","#13158

In a couple weeks I will have known whether I cheated Proctorio or not.
I had a final for a course this week. I spent a lot of my time on Reddit/Instagram/Tinder/Facebook/Snapchat and also got a job, so I didn't really study for the class. Furthermore, I had found an exploit of Proctorio that didn't involve having another electronic device or concealed notes, but did not use the exploit to cheat until this particular final. On the previous finals where I had Proctorio, I set everything up for the exploit and was not contacted for cheating. However this final I fully used the exploit to actually cheat.
If I succeed, I'll follow up and state how I exploited Proctorio, and therefore UBC can stop using Proctorio once and for all. Otherwise I'll just state I got caught without explaining how.
Morally, I wasn't justified, as I could have eased off social media or take time off work or otherwise use good time management skills. No need to convince me that I did the right thing. But I've been itching to try it out cause I wanted to push the boundaries and hopefully prove that this software, as invasive as it is, does not prevent cheating from happening. It helped that I am not white/asian/indigenous and the lighting was slightly off, so studying facial patterns or my gaze would be pretty difficult for Proctorio. Further the exam was at the level where searching through a compiled list of notes would actually help, unlike MATH 100 where you can't really learn differential calculus while doing the exam.
Any instructors reading this who believed in Proctorio: it is time to stop. Proctorio introduces new issues without solving them. Fellow students, I recommend you avoid electives that use Proctorio if you can, because people like me will exploit the system that scared others into not cheating. It creates an unequitable environment.","#13151

All they had to say was “switch to other courses that aren’t at set times”. Ridiculous answer, as all the courses I’ve registered for are requirements to graduate.

Today was a prime example as to why us Sauder students get labelled as ""snakes"".
I dropped in to the Undergraduate Office's virtual office hours via BB Collaborative for some help with course planning. There was a virtual line with an approximate 5 minute wait but nothing too bad. Some student dropped in and within 30 seconds writes a message in the ""everyone"" group chat complaining about how Sauder never supports their students and can never be depended on.

I know registration is a frustrating and anxious time, but episodes like these really gives the entire program and community a bad rep.

Today was a prime example as to why us Sauder students get labelled as ""snakes"".
I dropped in to the Undergraduate Office's virtual office hours via BB Collaborative for some help with course planning. There was a virtual line with an approximate 5 minute wait but nothing too bad. Some student dropped in and within 30 seconds writes a message in the ""everyone"" group chat complaining about how Sauder never supports their students and can never be depended on. A few moments later, another student in the chat responds and agrees with the student, then curses at the receptionist. They both left a few moments later.

There's been a lot of controversy around Michael Korenberg being either an alt-right troll, a neo-Nazi, or a tech-dumb boomer who's sympathetic to alt-right neo-Nazis. I really do think all the talk around cancelling him or firing him from the job misses the point. If we simply let him go, he does nothing useful for anyone. Instead, I suggest we set up a special event on Canada Day at Main Mall, called ""Eat Michael Korenberg Day"". The benefits of such an event are obvious. Firstly, the weather is getting nicer these days, and everyone wants to come out for a nice grill and some beer. If we eat Michael Korenberg, it will be a nice reason for everyone to come out in the sunshine and get some food and much needed socialization after the lockdown. This also has the added benefit of being outdoors, which will help social distancing, which will make Dr Bonnie Henry happy (can we invite her?) Furthermore, since UBC has refused to waive school fees or offer any across-the-board financial aid to students, but insist they really care about us, offering free food by eating Michael Korenberg would be a strong message that they really do want to provide for us. Lastly, I understand that some people might object to eating Michael Korenberg for ethical reasons. Vancouver is after all known for its many vegans. However, one of the reasons vegans refuse to eat meat is because of the meat industry's carbon footprint. If we eat Michael Korenberg, we completely eliminate *his* carbon footprint. I see this as an absolute win. We can even prepare Michael Korenberg the halal way to make sure the Muslim members of our community can join in too. Mr Korenberg, sir, you are cordially invited to Main Mall on Canada Day. Please wear an apple in your mouth.","#13148

when i was on the 16 today, i saw a white woman catch an elderly asian woman just before she fell. she helped her to a seat and when the elderly woman had to get off she helped her again. there was another older asian couple that watched this exchange go on and they thanked her profusely for helping. as the woman was about to get off the bus, she went and said to the elderly couple, ""it's going to be ok. you and i are the same, stay strong"" and then she got off the bus.
not gonna lie to you, i started tearing up.
with everything going on in the world, BLM, COVID, yemen crisis, etc. it just made me so happy to see something like that.
i was having a conversation with my friend the other day, about how we were wary of walking around unless we had one of our white friends with us.
how fucked up is it that a couple of college students don't feel safe walking around their hometown unless they have a white person with them, how fucked up is it that i almost cried because i saw a person help another, how fucked up is it that racism is so ingrained in the world that it takes the blood shed of a RIDICULOUS amount of BIPOCs AND a pandemic that forces people to spend their time online to WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT RACISM EXISTS AND HARMS OTHERS.
this wasn't supposed to turn into a rant about racism, this was really honestly just supposed to be me sharing a happy story but then i remembered that the world exists. so.
TL;DR
NOBODY has the right to commit cultural genocide/persecute others based on the LEVEL OF MELANIN in their skin.","#13147

It took me about one week to find a room at UBC to take my GMAT Online which is used for grad school applications. Thanks to AMS administration, I got a study room scheduled for the test. I chose not to do it in my dorm because it requires a quiet environment and my room faces the kitchen- I didn’t want to ask my roommates not to enter the kitchen for three hours. I attached a notice on the door of the study room in the Nest saying that my use of this room is approved by AMS, and “please do not disturb me. Please do not knock the door. Thank you.” During the exam, a girl was knocking at my door and yelling at me. I cannot turn my face to her or leave my seat as I was monitored by the camera, so I waved at her trying to tell her to stop. Then she started to slap my window, lasting for around one minute. Now I’m so frustrated because it seriously affected my performance. There’s a chance my grade will be cancelled because clearly there was an interruption. I got so anxious because it might also leave a record on my profile. If you, who knocked at the door, yelled at me and slapped the window, are reading this post: WHY DID YOU DO THIS??? I wrote a notice with A4 paper clear enough to read and comprehend, I worked on a part time basis apart from 4 online courses in order to pay for the exam, I studied days and nights for this exam...why did you do that??? Why??? Either you are an unprofessional staff member or a student who was doing that for fun, you hurt me. If it’s the latter: you were having fun at the cost of a person’s future.","#13145

cw: sexual violence, dysphoria, depression
it’s taken a lot of time and energy for me to be ready to write this confession, but i’m having a hard time keeping this bottled up. hopefully some of you find this helpful. for context, i am a cis-presenting male student at UBC and i’ve been having serious trouble with my identity over the last few years. this experience has exacerbated by abuse that i faced while in UBC’s dorms.
i was assaulted in my dorm room by someone who wrote a UBC crushes post about me. i reached out to him after he wrote a post about me, and he came over one night to play video games. i wasn’t crazy about him, so i stopped talking to him. i felt it was obvious that i wasn’t interested— i wasn’t engaging in conversation, and things were generally pretty awkward. thought it would end there.
a few days later, he came over uninvited and very drunk— i don’t drink, so i didn’t notice until he sat next to me in my bed and i caught the smell of vodka. i know it sounds dumb, but i’m just not good at recognizing those things. over the coming hours, he thrust himself on me in a variety of ways. rubbing my feet, licking my ear, begging for kisses, and taking big-spoon positions which kept me from getting out. months of re-traumatizing through interviews and emails with UBC’s Investigation Office later, they told me that indeed, i was assaulted. thanks.
as someone who’s unfamiliar with their sexuality and boundaries, this sort of thing has happened to me before. but i wasn’t at all equipped to deal with the fetishization of my dysphoria that came with this abuse. he described himself as a “[myname]-sexual,” being attracted to me regardless of my identity, and using they/them pronouns for me despite never being informed of my preferred pronouns.
nearly two years later, it’s come to light that i’m likely trans/non-binary. i have a lot of self-discovery to do still, but the idea of experimenting with my identity reminds me of my abuser. i have a difficult time talking about this without dissociating for hours until i forget about it. this is my way of reaching out— what should i do? i’ve tried to force cishet behaviours and styles, but i get so depressed living like that.
it’s likely that my abuser will see this and recognize my story and my writing. that’s fine— you don’t get to block me on all social media platforms to forget about what you did to me. because i haven’t— UBC may have coddled you to keep you around, but they didn’t do any of that shit for me. i still hate myself, and it’s not some uwu-femboy shit for you to jerk off to. they didn’t give me therapy. they didn’t tell me what action they took against you. they didn’t do shit— i’m just as broken as i was before. i’m queer, and you’ve made me horrified to face that reality. fuck you. and fuck UBC.","#13142

TL;DR Graduated and have no money because I gambled it away to steal a hype girl from a Jimin (BTS) look alike.
It was September 2015 when I met her, for the sake of this we'll call her L. She had this infectious smile and a very attractive personality aside from the looks, which, by the way, is a 9 /10. Our first class together she was wearing short shorts and an oversized sweater with her Chanel bag. At the time, I wasn't really into the hype stuff but she was into something else, someone else. He kind of looked like Jimin from BTS, but the cheap version. Nonetheless, he stole her heart. This guy would always show up and give her these box roses that were $100 worth and you could see the daydream in her eyes. It wasn't until CPSC320 when I found out the truth.
The truth is L was dating him. Around this time frame, I inherited 25 grand from my grandma because she passed. I was a bit jealous, so I wanted to use some of that money to buy some nicer clothes to impress L. Some time had passed and I did some research on VSC and walked around campus to see what was trending. I met up with a couple 'hypebeasts' as they're called. They recommended Canada Goose, FoG, Gucci shoes or Yeezy. An LV backpack gets the ""pussy"" said one member. Another one flexed his Rolex and said, ""It takes one to know one,"" whatever that means. Anyways, I bought myself a Thom Browne hoodie, Comme des Garçons shirt, FoG pants, Gucci shoes and I copped that LV backpack. EOSC 442 is where I first flexed on her and found out she was finally single.
She was surprised and blushed. She said, ""I really like your sweater"" with a wink. I asked her if she wanted to go to my place to study that day. Wait, Fuck! I don't have a car. I had my N but my parents had the car so we ended up chilling at her place. I told her about not having a car and been wanting to order a Tesla Model 3 for the longest time. She opened her Macbook Pro and opened the Tesla website and wanted to customize the car with me. I couldn't resist and copped it with FSD. Aside from inheriting the 25 grand, I was also working as an intern in a small tech company in Yaletown and all the savings I built up from there went towards a Tesla and clothes to impress the girl of my dreams. Fast forward weeks before my graduation, I confessed my feelings towards her and she pulled me aside to say, ""I'm not really ready for a relationship right now."" I was shook, I wanted to jump off a cliff and forget the last 5 years. I'm drowning in debt and my parents just told me a couple of weeks ago I will have to find my own place because they're moving to Toronto due to a family emergency. I'm panicking at the moment. I wish all of you the best of luck post-grad, and for the love of God, wish me luck too.","#13139

“Even though black lives do matter we propose to use slavery to lower cost”
Wtf was that? I know we’re supposed to act as Columbus and present to the queen to get funding, but nowhere in the requirement says “use slavery if needed”. It literally said we can borrow funds from the central bank if costs are high, and even encouraged us to come up with alternate social enterprise ideas in consideration of the injustice caused by that expedition in history.
The blatant racism shocked all of us
Do you know our TA herself is a POC?

This is my first year at UBC. I am very confused and angry. I don't know what to do about my current situation. I have tried reaching out to a few people but I cannot resolve it, so I came here.
In march I had taken a midterm, I have people who saw me take it and I actually had a friend sitting next to me when I took it. I thought it went well, and like any other midterm I studied my ass off. When I checked my grade, it was blank and it continued to be blank throughout the semester. Keep in mind this is my first year at UBC, and I started classes in January. I had teachers in IB withhold my grade for an exam until the end of the semester and I thought that is what was happening here. When the end of the semester came, I had an email from the professor saying my midterm was missing, and I was going to fail the class because of it. Which is $4000 gone. I tried emailing him twice but he didn't respond. I have talked to the TA's and they said they don't know what happened. Is there anyone I can reach out to, I don't understand what to do, or what I can do. I literally can't sleep bc of this.","#13136

So far, UBC has been one of the best experiences in my life. I enjoy so much of what it means to be at UBC, and Im proud to be a student here. I don't think I hear this enough, so I wanted to put it out there. Every morning I used to wake up looking at the mountains, and the sea. (I lived in upper OC), and when I would walk to class, I would look at the a beautiful landscape of the snow capped mountains and it really made my day better, no matter how cold, hungry, tired or anxious I was. When I tried to make friends, everyone was accepting of me and invited me to their parties. I didn't manage to make any serious friendships though, which put me off for a bit, but the overall experience has been really nice. I think there were a lot of other small things at UBC that made it fun, but you really had to look for it and be open to a lot of new stuff.","#13135

There will come a time when you * must * sever yourself from them, because enough is enough, but only when you are ready to do so, and not before, otherwise you might end up harming yourself. But cut yourself loose and free you must if your situation calls for it because the ongoing toxicity will eventually kill you, not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’. You will know when that time comes to cut yourself off and only do so when you’re certain AND when you’re certain you’re ready (such as being psychologically and financially prepared). You deserve a good and happy life. Imagine such a life everyday and you’ll end up attracting it, even if it takes a long time. Wishing you peace and happiness.","#13134

I'm an engineering student, and I wish we wouldn't be stereotyped so much. There's a huge silence on the mental health issues people experience in this faculty, because of the labels and stereotypes put on us.
I was talking to another student at an event one time, and when I said that I was studying engineering, she replied ""I thought you guys would be alot more awkward"".
People usually talk about how engineers are arrogant or condescending. We hate them too. There are alot of us who dislike these people, who have a disproportionally loud voice compared to the many other students whose voices are never heard, because of the rock bottom self confidence they have from society labeling them as ""socially awkward"", and ""nobody wants to talk to you"".
Five years of studying engineering, and I've met so many people who are depressed and have non-existent self esteem because society has told them to believe that they're not worth talking to, that nobody cares about them, that they were born to be alone in life.
Where a person in any other faculty posts about how they've experienced these issues, they release lots of words of support. They're told that they matter. But where engineering students are concerned, that support quickly evaporates. There is no depressed engineering student or depressed art student - there is a depressed student who needs support, and I wish people would give them all the same hope.","#13133

I wish UBC would stop being so concerned with its reputation. Notice that in nearly every single news release, at the bottom they’re always talking about how they’re ranked at whatever place globally for universities. I follow them on Twitter and they paid to promote a tweet showing their global ranking. Weird flex but okay. I get that they want to expand their brand; however, that in itself is the problem. The school shouldn’t be concerned with its “brand” so much as improving itself, because it’s a PUBLIC school and not a business. Well at least it shouldn’t be, in my opinion. I was talking to a UBC prof the other day when I ran into him at a party (no he’s not creeping on students, we just so happen to be in a mutual friend group and this particular prof is pretty young) and he said his issue with UBC is that it’s become a corporate entity. UBC is no longer an institution that dedicates itself to higher learning and furthering young Canadian students. Instead of showing the world that we’re top 40 globally and shouting it from the rooftops, why won’t they turn their attention to the multitudes of internal issues plaguing UBC? For example, how many of my fellow students know that since 2009, total funding and revenue has increased but actual teachers AND teaching spaces have actually relatively decreased? How many of my fellow undergrads have lived on a campus that is perpetually undergoing construction for one thing or another? Finally, UBC’s mental support network for the large student population is woefully inadequate, which is even worse once you take into account how insanely competitive and difficult it is to succeed at this school.
One last thing, I used to go to the Okanagan campus before transferring here and I think it’s really unfortunate how so many UBCV students demonize and look down on people who go there. I mean, UBC students will whine and moan about there being so little school spirit on campus (which is admittedly true); but those exact same people will talk down to UBCO students as if they’re second rate and as if they’re not receiving the exact same, if not better education lmaooo.","#13130

Never thought I'd be writing this, and you guys really went all-out in the kink shaming in the other post. I agree with OP that you guys have your own weird sexual repressions to work out, but here goes:
In a similar lens to #13108, I've also managed to use my sexual fantasies to become a more organized, orderly and tidy person. Contrary to the belief that all girls are neat and tidy, we're really fucking not. It got to the point where there was trash and dishes scattered across my room. My girlfriend (just for context, I'm a lesbian) just stopped visiting me and refused to cuddle with me because of how much of a dump my place was. Obviously this was really fucking heartbreaking for me and she was pretty much about to dump my ass for being the messiest girl alive.
Anyways, how did we work past it? I've had a huge kink for roleplaying and cosplaying as a maid (Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is one of my favorite animes of all time, even though it's cheesy and goofy). So I went out, ordered a made-to-order cosplay maid dress, a chastity belt, and some whips, and we've made it into a regular thing where she'll come over, order me around, tease me in a chastity belt (to incentivize me) and make me do all that goofy ""master/femdom"" crap (we get a kick out of it, but I enjoy her effort and how carefree it makes our relationship). She'll order me around to clean my things, and whip me during my chores unexpectedly (though we've set some clear rules like no whipping when I'm carrying irritating chemicals or in a vulnerable position). Afterwards, depending on how long it takes me, she'll whip me according to how much time I've spent and usually either cuddle or fuck (in no particular order). The pain is the hottest thing ever.
It took some time to convince my girlfriend that this was the right way forward, but I'm really thankful that I leaned into my kinks and used them to improve the way that I live. Indirectly, it's made me a much happier, cheerful person who doesn't wallow when faced with difficult tasks, and overall a lot of my improvement in grades can definitely be attributed to how much more of a mindful and persistent person I am now.
Your sexual fantasies can go hand-in-hand with becoming a better person.","#13129

They say success demand sacrifice. But what they never told me was it would take away everything from me - My family, my friends, my memories. Now I have difficulty in remembering those places where I used to go for movies with my friends, places I would go and eat, places I would go to get away from my parents.. Everything is left behind.the question arises again - was it all worth it? was it? I miss the only love of my life. I met so many guys-good looking, successful, handsome- but none of them are him. I fell in love again-but I cannot be with him. I cannot. Why everything appears so confusing. The moment I think I got the ans, it leaves me with few more questions. Life is so simple yet it becomes calculative and demanding. Am I demanding too much from myself? Or is it the society that expects me to live a certain way so they can accept me? What is it? It is too much. It is ?","#13128

It was fortunate if you thought it that way, school was taking my time and my thoughts away from them. But now I think I personally just can’t handle going through this (maybe cause no more busy studying). Its gotten to too many extremes. With multiple starting news and forgiving - the problems are still there. So heres to it: people who don’t want to change won’t change. People who blame others for their faults will keep blaming others. I know these kind of people existed, but it’s just sad and disappointing to know that they are someone who you should look up to and is family.","#13126

Some of the doctors who tortured native americans in Nanaimo are still licensed and practicing today. Doctors in Alberta who forcefully and non-consensually sterilized native American women are still alive and practicing right now. This year my father sent me a message saying it was a miracle he was alive because he thought the police would shoot him, after someone called the cops saying ""a native guy"" had shot a gun in the area. Native people are dying -right now- because of this systemic racism, poverty, and trauma.

I am a native american woman, this summer I had the opportunity to visit the holocaust memorial sites in Berlin. I stood in the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and an elderly Jewish man sat down beside me and said ""I see you, I can see that you have experienced this too, I can see it"". That was the first time in my life I cried in public. I told him about the genocide in Canada, how the survivors of the genocide, my family members, would die by suicide one after the other. How the worst, the most painful, part was that it was erased. I told him how I had been imagining what it would have been like if the Nazi's had won, no memorials, no memories of those murdered. They would have been erased. So we sat and we cried together and he said ""I am so sorry"". He tore the fabric he was wearing and said ""this is how we mourn the death of loved ones, know that your people are not erased, they are in my heart now too, I will never forget"".","#13122

3rd Year, I decided to join a hiking club. I'm always the type to get out of my comfort zone and try new things (to the extent of looking like a fool). Before the first hike (was also the last hike), I never thought I'd ever feel so poor, so ""unclassy,"" so outcasted in my life. And it wasn't even the club's fault.
Most of the new members weren't originally from Canada (including me). Everyone else but me was very well-travelled (despite having the same age). They had all these cool experiences from other countries. They'd talk about how they're from Germany, France, US etc., and would from time-to-time just seamlessly rebound to any random convo and say something along the lines of ""hey, my aunt was neighbours with your country's 13th president"" or ""yeah, it's kind of annoying how my country has seven categories for recycling."" Life just seemed so easy, hearing them talk about politics, and how they'd ""sail boats"" in their free time. Hell, my country doesn't even know what recycling is.
When I found someone I finally could connect with, I got hit with that ""oh yeah I had a maid from your country and she--."" Not even about a beach, a tourist site, a celebrity, or a fruit from my country?
I felt so out-of-place, ""non-elite,"" ""off-brand,"" just so different, that I forgot I've been hiking a tall ass moUNTAIN on a rainy day for 2 hours straight. My goal wasn't even to hike and meet new people anymore but to ""fit in,"" to ""say something cool."" It was like there was a bubble I couldn't pop. They were all talking in the same language as me but they were talking in a language I was foreign to at the same time?","#13121

I know this is going to attract a lot of kink shaming, but please hear me out, and before you reserve judgement, just know that you yourself and whoever you're tagging have some weird, fucked up sexual fantasies too. It might not be related to mine, but don't act as if you're morally superior for laughing at a girl who embraces her sexuality on the internet.
I've been reflecting on my journey here at UBC so far, and how far I've come: I wouldn't have gotten into UBC PharmD if it wasn't for my adult baby/diaper kink (and also kind of my dd/lg kink).
In my first year, I was in an abusive relationship and constantly mentally shutting down. I had no idea what I was doing in first year BSc, wondering if I'd fail out, learned I couldn't code for shit, and at one point ended up in the hospital for a mental breakdown, just constantly panicking about how fucking horrible my life was.
When I finally got out of my abusive relationship, I leaned into my repressed adult baby kink and ordered some diapers, diaper covers and adult baby dresses (along with a magic wand). I studied in diapers, slept in diapers, admired myself in the mirror. Diapers are actually really soft and comforting. I found a daddy and formed a caring, supportive, non-sexual relationship. I got back on track with a study schedule, rewarded myself with LoL gametime, coloring books and more little girl fashions. When I fucked up with school, my daddy made me do lines and promise to do better (and I really internalized the guilt).
It worked, and my grades and mental health improved a lot. For once, I was actually getting As, working my butt off, more relaxed than ever. My kinks were like adult safety blankets, and my anxiety was basically gone. When I became a pharmacy assistant, I felt it was so liberating to have more spending money for diapers and rompers. Even when I got into PharmD, I was doing pretty well overall, or at least hugely better than my first-year.
Everyone has different coping strategies. I never really admitted this to anyone but the people directly involved my kink, I always just passed it off as getting my shit together and becoming really organized. My friends don't know (for obvious reasons), nor do any first years I mentor.
COVID-19 is full of uncertainty, and if the usual mindfulness, meditation and coping strategies aren't working for you, maybe its time to consider something more meaningful for you, whether it be art, journaling, or your sexual fantasies.","#13118

UBC needs a T&T on campus.
Before I came here everyone back in China said “oh you’re gonna miss all the Chinese dishes” and stupid me was like “nah actually I prefer fries and salads”. I was stupid. After spending more than a year in Vancouver I crashed into this quarantine unexpectedly like everyone else but landed with my drooling mouth and demanding stomach grinding painfully on the land of UBC, aka the desert of cuisines. My hardcore East Asian soul crave for more food which can give me illusions of home. I sacrificed my budget to the international tuition to the last pennies and just cannot afford more Uber eats or Fantuan or Chowbus. When I could still survive on the dog foods on campus I never really worried about taking a 25 and going to T&T: I didn’t cook and only get some occasional snacks from there. However, as now I have to cook and have to stay in my miserable dorm room all day, my demand for T&T rockets. Yes, I know we have Hmart and other Asian markets near the campus but, but, BUT. A Chinese is never satisfied. The last time we were satisfied ended up the British being angy and dumped opium to us; so yeah we can’t be satisfied. What’s bad about an additional Asian market on campus? T&T just have more! More! Let along all the grass jelly and Jiuniang, I can also get SE Asian snacks and packs of Japanese face masks; I can literally hear tons of delicious Taiwanese foods and snacks shouting begging me to put them in my shopping cart, while it’s already loaded with rice dumplings and other freshly made warm dim sum. Also, where else am I supposed to shop large amount of veggies and meat by just reading the easy Chinese labels instead of holding my mobile with google translate on all the time?
So last week I went to T&T, the marine drive one, and walked back to res from the bus loop alone, with four big bags of groceries. 38 kg me just couldn’t do it. 9pm at the west parkade, I sat down in the middle of the road and cried. My back hurt, my arms were sour, I had drained last drop of my strength. I live alone in this foreign country dealing with one of the biggest crisis in this century, I am stressed and sometimes depressed, there’s no one around I can talk to comfortably in Mandarin, my parents will never understand me, all they want is for me to spend more than 10k dollars to get a ticket and go back to China, where I can’t say that I stand with HK and our country needs a revolution bad. I just don’t know what to do. The last thing I wanted was to be stranded outside with groceries that I couldn’t carry by myself, and these groceries were my last relief, from a market quite far away from res.
All I want is a T&T on campus. I hope that one day if I just had enough with schoolwork, I can just wander off, walk into that T&T, buy a full bag of my favorite snacks and warm dim sum, and go back to work refreshed and comforted.
I know. I’m greedy and I want a lot. But now I just want a T&T on campus.","#13117

I never had blinds or distance between living spaces growing up in my home country. So now that I'm here, living on campus, safe and secure and in control of my own body, I am gleefully anti-blinds. In the two residences I've lived and including the one I'm in now, I have not put the blinds down once. Not while sleeping, not while changing, not while having sex (I keep this activity outside daylight hours for respect), not while dancing naked to Spanish club music. I love the sun. I love the trees. I have always been on or near street level, nowhere super high foot traffic but definitely not isolated. If you live on campus too, you may have even seen me. I love the fact that of the many, many windows, I am just one, and someone looking in casually may or may not see me. Am I an exhibitionist? Maybe at heart, but I like the idea that I don't know my audience and that they have no way of identifying who I am (I'm too far from the streets themselves for my face to be captured clearly). I want to be one of those token surreal faceless bodies French films show fantasies of. As a relatively fit woman, I get no sexual gratification from this, but a weird thrill. Mostly I just enjoy the fact that I can do this safely and its strangely empowering. So if you've had the fortune/misfortune of seeing my naked body, thank you, I apologize, and you're welcome.","#13115

An incredibly well respected and generally well-liked Professor at UBC is in the habit of predating on young undergrad girls at the school. He is a director of an engineering program that is very well regarded. I know this because he tried to pick me up on Tinder a few months ago, in 1st semester. I've been waiting until now that I'm graduated to even bring this up or think about it again because I felt so, so, so disgusted and afraid that he'd somehow use his position of power and authority to make my life difficult if I tried to talk to people about this.
He is in his 50's and he is actively trying to sleep with girls as young as 20, 21, i.e. 2nd year undergrads. He teaches undergrad courses and I feel awful for the young women in his program because he doesn't view them as students, he views them as potential sexual partners. It actually makes me sick to hear his own students speak so highly of him when in reality he is a sexual predator that would abuse his position of authority to take advantage of young women.
I have screenshots of our conversation on Tinder where even after I said I'm a current undergrad he gives me his phone number and tries to ask me out for coffee. I am shaking with anxiety over what to do here. I want the whole world to know exactly what kind of sleezy douchebag this guy is, but I am so terrified that he'll come after me and it'll be my word versus his.

It actually makes me sick to hear his own students speak so highly of him when in reality he is a sexual predator that would abuse his position of authority to take advantage of young women.
I have screenshots of our conversation on Tinder where even after I said I'm a current undergrad he gives me his phone number and tries to ask me out for coffee. I am shaking with anxiety over what to do here. I want the whole world to know exactly what kind of sleezy douchebag this guy is, but I am so terrified that he'll come after me and it'll be my word versus his.

I recently got an email falsely accusing me of cheating on the final exam for a cpsc course. This was one of the courses that I worked the hardest on and studied my ass off for, and was really proud of my success on the exam. Now I feel depressed and helpless, and I don't know what to do. I have a meeting scheduled about this, and I honestly don't trust the system to clear this up. At this point I just hate school and don't give a fuck anymore. I have no idea what I can do to prove I am innocent.","#13112

Recently I’ve been reading many negative comments about Sauder on UBC confessions. Personally, I spent 4 years studying in Sauder and graduated this year. Not to say “I’ve seen it all”, but I’d like to think I have a good understanding of the “Sauder culture”, so here’s what I think:
- Sauder students can look intimidating. The intimidation can come from the way students dress, their use of language, or their intelligence (or “acting” smart lol). Trust me, I’ve felt it too. However, what others do to make themselves look good is up to them, and whether you choose to let that be intimidating is up to you. If you are new to Sauder and are feeling intimidated, instead of blaming your peers, start considering what you can do to feel like you belong. Time to step it up hun.
- The term Sauder “snakes” became popular during my second year. Some people are offended by the term, but here’s how I see it: business students value genuine connection with their peers and are constantly helping each other. We are always networking with business professionals to learn more about the types of careers we might be interested in. We use the connections we built over the years to help us land our dream job. If that sounds like a “snake” thing to do, how about all the all-nighters we pulled to write our cases, study for exams and prepare for presentations? Beneath our “glamorous” foundation and concealer lies the real designer eyebags! Students at Sauder put in the hours and hard work to build their knowledge. I don’t know which part of all this is unethical, but if “snaking” into success is so easy, why don’t you get off the bench and do it? Don’t hate the player just because you suck at the game.
- Please take into the consideration of the feelings of all Sauder students when writing confessions like “EVERYONE looks down on you”, “EVERYONE feels superior”… poor baby, two people made your day shitty and you’re really going to trash on “EVERYONE”? Personally, I’ve made the most genuine, smart and trusting friends in Sauder. Not saying NOBODY ever fucked up my day in the past 4 years, but there are so few that I no longer remember. Don’t spend your energy writing confessions on those people who aren’t worth it. There will be assholes in every faculty, please don’t bring your fellow Sauderites down. Oh.. I guess if everywhere you go smells like shit, maybe it's time to check your own shoes?
If you want to feel like you belong in Sauder, trashing your peers online is not the way to do it. Just think back to why you applied for Sauder and what brought you here in the first place (you’re probably pretty awesome..?) Whatever you witness in uni is just the beginning, the real world has more waiting… same goes for all other faculties. Stay strong.

UBC is a really weird place. There are such extremes. We all talk about rich international Chinese students because it's easy to spot Gucci slippers and lambos.
But also in my four years here I've met two actual flesh and blood princes from existing Royal families AKA people that are still in power in their country and so many more descended from some form of nobility. Before coming here I thought that didn't really exist anymore. I grew up in a really middle class suburb on the east coast so I was shocked when I came here. I thought I grew up with such comfort, and now I see that I had no idea what I was talking about. There are so many children of 'the Elite' that go to school here. I thought that was Commons for maybe Harvard, not UBC.
Is this all normal? Sometimes I think UBC really ruined my perception of normal. It might be my major (art history and poli sci) yeah but it makes me feel really disheartened because I have a passion for what I study and came here on scholarship but these kind of people will probably do better than me just because of privilege. Even now I don't think I really fit in with them and just feel a little alienated. UBC just feels like a school for the elite and I am ashamed to admit it to anyone but I feel a little jealous.","#13109

I’m graduating this year and am in a good place career-wise but can’t help but feel like I missed out a little. In the end I left school unable to make a true friend. I met a lot of ppl through classes, clubs, and etc. Although we chatted and had fun, it felt as though I bounced around different groups like a thumbtack. There was never a group I truly clicked with and all of these connections felt shallow in a way— like mismatched puzzle pieces that you have to shave down to try to fit.
That’s because life is not a puzzle piece. There can’t be a perfect fit in every way. When dealing with other people, you inevitably have to compromise. I told myself this over and over as I continued to feel out-of-place, no matter which group I tried to enter.
It’s just a shame. A damn shame I can’t truly say I relate to all the people around me going ah “I’m thankful I went to this university, that I met all these wonderful people that changed my life.”
Still, even if no one came into my life and changed it, I think I changed my own life. I’m thankful to myself for trying, for bettering myself in various ways. At the end of the day, I’m left with myself, knowing that I’ve become reliable, that I have faith in myself to push me past whatever night that awaits me.","#13108

One thing I think a lot of people don't think about but I'm sure some people are going through is the struggle of children of divorce. I for one usually live on res/rent my own place during the school year and then alternate between my parent's places during the summer. However, as you can imagine, covid has changed the situation *slightly* in that classes are online for the foreseeable future, and I'm now going to have to either go between houses during my schooling or pick one place and stay (which would heavily offend the other parent).
Problem is, I don't want to deal with this BS anymore, but am too broke to rent my own place since I lost my job. So either I flip flop where I live (which I despise and heavily affects my mental state for the worse) or feel the wrath of one of my parents. It's a lose-lose situation.

I personally cancelled my UBC housing contract when I moved out in March but I only have one more year. All over the world companies are taking hits and offering concessions to their customers.

I always see people post about their horrible experiences with UBC Counselling services but never good ones. I actually had a really great experience when I got counselling so I wanted to put mine out there as an encouragement to those who are looking for help and to show that not all experiences with UBC Counselling are bad ones. I know not everyone has a good experience and I might just have been lucky with mine, but both stories deserve to be put out there for people to decide whether they want to seek help from UBC or not.
I was going through some anxiety issues 3 years ago and I went to the counselling center and filled out the first timer form, waited ~10 mins, and got called in for an introductory interview. The lady who interviewed me said it was to see who I should be placed with. I didn’t have student insurance and I didn’t know if my insurance covered counselling services so I was placed with a practicum student. A week later I was called in for an appointment with a practicum student from Adler University. I had four sessions with her in total, one every 2 weeks. She was a really great counsellor! She remembered me everytime and remembered the issues that we had discussed, and always made me feel heard and listened to. She gave me homework to do in between of sessions which helped me improve and kept me accountable for doing them too. She was a really great help in my life. The exercises she gave me has helped me feel waay better than anyone can by just listening and our sessions revealed a lot of underlying problems that I had pushed away which was causing my anxiety. It took effort on my part with following through with the homework and for her to give me homework that was challenging but achievable, but by the end of my four sessions, my anxiety had significantly decreased. I still have some anxiety but it’s way less than it was before and I know how to cope with it in a productive manner now, thanks to my counsellor! I am so thankful for my sessions with her and for UBC Counselling services because they put me with her.
That was my personal story with UBC Counselling services. Again, I just want to put this out there for anyone who is considering or wanting to seek help but isn’t sure about seeking help because so many people have had terrible experiences with the services. I’m not trying to gloat or invalidate anyone’s experience, I just want to show that not all experiences at UBC counselling are bad ones.","CW: mental health

I’m struggling financially and if I miss a rent payment they will add interest + stop me from registering for courses. I can’t even get emergency funding because I’m not living at UBC and not turning to be homeless. Also, they have the audacity to make us pay for the pool and services that are not essential. What do you want me to do? Pay with my kidney so that you can beautify the rose garden. And don’t even get me started on the counselling and advising services.

So having just finished my first year in UBC Sauder, I've never really felt like I belonged. The perceived atmosphere of the place just makes it really intimidating for me. It feels like.. I can't make any mistakes that make me look dumb because as soon as you don't look as smart as the others, everyone looks down on you. I can't be the only one that feels like Sauder is a faculty where everyone just acts so damn smart even if they're not. It's like we are the kids that throw in unecessary complicated words into essays just to make it sound more mature, when it really doesn't change the essay's content or quality at all. It's also like everyone has the urge to pounce on literally just anyone just to make themselves feel superior?
On top of that, I've been majorly depressed (btw I support all those confessions that say UBC counselling is actually worse than trash) Due to this, I haven't joined any clubs in UBC at all and haven't made any close friends at all, however, I never show my loneliness or sadness to anyone just so I don't look inferior to others. And this perspective isnt just an illusion that is completely made up by me because I've actually noticed that people that are their true selves in group projects right off the bat get looked down upon and are seen as inferior people. One time I had this clumsy guy in my group who wasn't really scared to talk like an idiot even though he was mega creative and smart. Because of his behaviour, everyone started to look down on him and his intelligence and in the end, no one wanted to use his actual intelligent ideas for the group project even though I kinda thought he had waaaaaay better ideas than the rest of the team. I supported his ideas initially but after awhile, it was like peer pressure just scared me off and silenced him as well (if u reading this, sorry about that group bro). Long story short, I think that most Sauder students have some kind of superiority complex and if not, they act like that to fit in.
Do any other Sauder students feel this way?","#13100

As I sat at my desk, grinding out MATH 221 and PHIL 220 in hopes of completing these courses faster than all my imbecile peers, the familiar ding from my phone suddenly ruins my intense concentration. I pick up this disgusting distraction, preparing to shut it off to prevent further interruption of my genius work time. My eye catches the shameful text of a peer from PHIL 220: ""Can someone help me with this?""
Hands shaking, I stare in absolute disbelief. How could I, an incredible school prodigy, be placed in a class where my lowly peers REQUIRE HELP? As if this peasant-brain's text isn't enough, another foolish student replies in an attempt to help. How dare he attempt to help his peer.
""It is not enough that I succeed, others must fail,"" I muttered.
My neck twitches with anger as I scream: ""I WILL END YOUR CAREER!!!""
I open my e-mail and begin furiously typing to the professor. I, the most talented of all students, must report all those who ask for and give help, as it is a duty I bestowed upon myself to become the smartest, favouritest, and bestest student of all the professors in the world. As I hear the satisfying click of the ""send"" button, my lips curl into a nasty smile. I tap my fingers together and dream of the things the professor will say.
""Thank you dearest pet student for reporting those bad bad children. You are my favouritest and all of them but you will fail this course.""

I think as an organization thats supposed to be dedicated to the creation of events for the UBC student body this was a COMPLETE WASTE OF FUNDS. We're all in an unfortunate, unprecedented situation right now and the last thing we need is some idiot to go spend our student fees on this meaningless message from someone who has no connection to UBC whatsoever. How is this acceptable? How is this an inspiring message to the Grads of 2020?

With regards to the UBC counseling services post that someone posted recently. Boy calling the counseling services shitty is an understatement. I actually went to counseling with them because there was a domestic abuse problem at home with my dad (threatening to kill me etc) and my mom and dad were getting seperated and I needed help like I was a mess. I went 3 times and the councilor lost the notes from the first time on the second visit and then again on the 3rd had to start all over. She kept saying she lost the notes or forgot about it and asking me what the issues were and going over the same introductory questions. Actually no on the third visit she thought I was someone else and had decided my problem was shyness and was like see you are all better and i had to remind her what the problem is in the first place. After that i quit. I was feeling like I was a burden on my parent especially with divorce and the councilor made me feel worse like I was inconveniencing her too by asking for help. Honestly these people need training rather than a new building.","#13089

It really bothers me how little school spirit we have at UBC. I get it, not everything is great. There are loads of things wrong with UBC, but honestly, that’s every university. They’re institutions! Of course there’s things wrong with them. UBC is a really awesome school, and I’m so proud to go here. Our campus is beautiful, and the people are so welcoming, and I’ve loved my classes so much. We have a fantastic president, we have cool unique buildings, we have a beach, we have everything.
I wish we had a greater sense of community and belonging. Why do we have to have so much pointless bickering and contest between faculties? We have rivalry between faculties, but not between other universities. Why don’t we uplift each other instead? Sure, inter faculty rivalry is plenty of fun, but adding some school spirit and rivalry with other schools would be so great. If other schools don’t want beef, let’s make them want it! UBC could have such a great culture. We are basically a college town! Almost. When everything goes back to normal, I hope we all go to more games, more events, more everything. Make it a fun school, a place that people looked at and said “I wish I could go there.” Not just for partying I mean. It’s a huge place, but we could still have a sense of belonging and pride in being UBC students. Maybe this is pointless and people disagree. But I just wish we had more school spirit, more togetherness. We need to step it up. Let’s go to more events. Let’s support our sports teams, and our musicians, and our artists, and our actors, our design teams, our grad conferences, and everything our student body does.

Thank you for being late to announce online classes when other universities had taken measure much quicker.
Thank you for delaying the announcement of online classes for the summer terms for so long that some of us got stuck in Vancouver.
Thank you for recognising this and giving us guaranteed housing, only to continue with the proposed raise in housing prices. Shoutout to all my protesting peers. If not for yall UBC would’ve definitely gone through with it.
Thank you for finally announcing which classes would be online for the fall term, even though it’s weeks later than most universities globally.
Thank you for pretending to care about your students and putting up a false facade for the world by posting about incoming first years.
Thank you for continuing to charge us abysmally high tuition, especially us international students, despite not providing the standard of education that you so proudly profess.
Thank you for screwing over clubs, student organisations and student grants monetarily, while making it your top priority to get refunded by the artists who were supposed to perform at the block party.
Thank you for providing a Credit/D/F option with an asterisk. Unavailable to scholarship students as well as those students following a STT.
So I guess what I’m trying to say is:
Thank you UBC for being at our beck and call and replying to all of us in a timely fashion. You have been nothing but helpful to us during this pandemic and I know that one day I’ll be proud to say: I was a student at UBC before the 2020 pandemic broke the illusory status of one of the best and most prestigious universities in the world.

TW: suicide
I have a confession to make.
I have an overall average of 88.5% (57 credits).
I even have gotten 100% on essays in poli sci and phil class. In fact, I scored top course grade in both classes. After my first year, I was on the dean's list and was awarded with Trek excellence scholarship, which is given to the top 5% students. I never shared this almost with anyone and kept it with myself (well and my parents).
But let me be honest, I never felt great. of course yeah I felt happy and relieved for like 5 minutes. But I felt so empty immediately, like as if it never happened, and the burden that I have to keep this up doubled. I even considered suicide in my second year cos nothing was joyful to me and I felt worthless. I also experienced severe writing anxiety. I know that some of y'all will say like i am being snotty but let me say this **i am being really honest**.
Let me tell you how I got these scores. I am a terrible writer and not even a native speaker. I never did anything that is unethical like I never hired someone to write for me nor I never plargilized (see i can't even spell this).
But I really tried my best to score well in essays cos that's the only area i have control over (i can edit it multiple times). yeah i suffered a lot with procrastination habits and had to mostly write things up when I was super insane that the deadline was coming in like 3 days or so (good old 1 day crammer happened occasionally). But before I started writing, I always read the instruction of the essay over and over, and once I decided upon my topic and rough structure, I often went to the TA's office hour and emailed them frequently. This was essential for me to get good grades cos (it's kinda obvious but) TAs are the ones who grade your papers. So every meeting I had with the TA, I recorded the meeting and made sure with the TA that everything I got is right and is aligned with their expectation (this is important cos they are often subjective). I even tried to mimic the sense of language they use for the parts I was stuck with. I tried to fix everything they did not like and added things that they told me I was missing.
SO.. What was all this for?? If I be brutally honest, I never wanted to fell like a failure and never wanted to feel like im a loser. YES cos I GOT NOTHING and I, in deep part of me, want that RECOGNITION from other people, REAFFIRMATION from external factors, evaluations, success, praise, whatever you call it. And thanks now this mind set that I MUST not make any mistake dominated me and totally fucked me up !
I am going into my third year and am trying to get into Honors. But seriously, I often feel like an imposter and even more than that is I feel very very empty... cos I can't find happiness within myself, any self-esteem, gratitude, comfort, worth, meaning that spring within myself. I want to be free from this obsession that results in vicious cycle, i don't want to keep seeking for reaffirmation from solely external sources that will just lead to even more miserable emptiness. But well, I am still very lost and feel like the only way to fix myself is to reincarnate. And I am very disappointed with my writing skill like how i am gonna strive in collage that will endlessly demand me to write and read and read and write? The house of cards that I built will collapse at some point, and by then i will feel like even the empty shell of mine is shattered—a total incompetent piece of shit. If anyone read through this, thank you so much. I feel like I couldn't articulate things well enough and there are many more things that i wanna say but i will stop here. I would greatly appreciate if anyone could give me any advice or whatever you want. I think I just really needed to get it out of myself and if possible see what other people will say of this.

TW: suicide
I have a confession to make.
I have an overall average of 88.5% (57 credits).
I even have gotten 100% on essays in poli sci and phil class. In fact, I scored top course grade in both classes. After my first year, I was on the dean's list and was awarded with Trek excellence scholarship, which is given to the top 5% students. I never shared this almost with anyone and kept it with myself (well and my parents).
But let me be honest, I never felt great. of course yeah I felt happy and relieved for like 5 minutes. But I felt so empty immediately, like as if it never happened, and the burden that I have to keep this up doubled. I even considered suicide in my second year cos nothing was joyful to me and I felt worthless. I also experienced severe writing anxiety. I know that some of y'all will say like i am being snotty but let me say this **i am being really honest**.
Let me tell you how I got these scores. I am a terrible writer and not even a native speaker. I never did anything that is unethical like I never hired someone to write for me nor I never plargilized (see i can't even spell this).
But I really tried my best to score well in essays cos that's the only area i have control over (i can edit it multiple times). yeah i suffered a lot with procrastination habits and had to mostly write things up when I was super insane that the deadline was coming in like 3 days or so (good old 1 day crammer happened occasionally). But before I started writing, I always read the instruction of the essay over and over, and once I decided upon my topic and rough structure, I often went to the TA's office hour and emailed them frequently. This was essential for me to get good grades cos (it's kinda obvious but) TAs are the ones who grade your papers. So every meeting I had with the TA, I recorded the meeting and made sure with the TA that everything I got is right and is aligned with their expectation (this is important cos they are often subjective). I even tried to mimic the sense of language they use for the parts I was stuck with. I tried to fix everything they did not like and added things that they told me I was missing.

Lately, I've a lot of trust in UBC professors and faculty because of their lack of understanding during this pandemic. I think I was done dirty a lot of times!!! But after enrolling into a new course for summer school, I have newfound hope in UBC professors.
Instead of scamming students with $200 dollar textbooks that we're literally never going to open again, my prof used 9.9% of 3 different textbooks to make sure that we wouldn't have to pay anything (copyright law says that you can distribute only up to 10% of a book for free). With our collaborate ultra classes, we take 5 min breaks!?!?! every 30 minutes ?!?! because he cares about our mental health and wellbeing ?!?!! tells us to drink some water and go outside and grab some snacks !?!?! On top of that, I emailed him last night asking him a few questions about the course and he respond with ""Thanks for your delightful email,"" ""I really appreciate your determination..students like you make my job such a joy! I would love to chat with you at office hours if you have more questions.."" and THE CHERRY ON TOP ""Just know that I am here for you, as are my TAs. It would be my pleasure to see you succeed here!""
I just wanted to give a shoutout to the best prof ever, thank you for making classes more enjoyable and caring about your students! You're the best!","#13082

I'm kinda annoyed by the fact that many professors are expecting us to get a paper copy of textbooks and readings from UBC bookstore right now. They only sell new copies so it will cost us like over a hundred for just one textbook. Yet, not many of us are still in Vancouver or BC. The shipping fee and wait time are just crazy.
If we get one from Amazon, it is very likely that we can't get it until mid of June.
What even more absurd is that we're asked to purchase 15 pages of materials from the bookstore only. Can't they just upload the materials to Canvas and save us some time and money.
I know copyright is a big thing but honestly, we students will just try even harder to get pirate ones or send pdf files to our friends now.
Sigh, textbook is a such big rip off.","#13080

This is going to be a lengthy but I hope it ends up being a positive learning tool for even one single person. Almost 6 years ago, I dropped out of a UBC Science specialization because my family suddenly couldn’t afford to pay tuition anymore due to unforeseen life circumstances. At the time, I figured I’d take the year break and use UBC’s policy to come back after a year without having to reapply. But a year passed by and my family’s overall financial situation was still terrible. I didn’t go back to UBC because it could have resulted in spending tons of tuition money while not having the time to work, and risk losing our home. I went to a smaller school in BC while working random jobs, studying a completely different field than what I was in at UBC solely because it would be relatively easy to get a degree in and find a job in (compared to science) and provide stable and above average income that could aid myself and my family. I re-applied to UBC every chance I could get, every single year, but was constantly rejected because my college level grades weren’t as high as my extremely high secondary school average was when I was first admitted to UBC.
For a significant portion of those past 6 years, I was devastated. I had constant depression, and a lot of disappointment with myself and my accomplishments, or lack thereof. I was born and raised in BC and all throughout high school, it was my dream to attend this school. Because I wasn’t from a well off family, I couldn’t keep going. I was young and followed the advice of my extended family who vehemently told me to not take out loans to go to school for a “mere science degree”.
One of the worst parts was that friends and extended family assumed for years that I dropped out due to poor grades. They weren’t the best, as first and second year science kids usually experience, but they weren’t nearly bad enough for me to be required to withdraw. A lot of people didn’t believe me.
It turns out the “well meaning advice” from extended “family"" regarding avoiding loans was actually malicious in nature. In the past few years I learned a lot about the creatures in my “family”. I was the first person ever in my immediate family to go to post-secondary, and I was and still am the only person in my entire extended family to have gone to a big, prestigious school like UBC. It angered and made a lot of these “caring” aunts, uncles, and cousins jealous. My parents have been blue collar workers their entire lives and as such they couldn’t provide me with proper advice and guidance on what to do. I don’t at all blame them for that and I’m grateful to everything they could and have provided me. However, none of us ever thought all these people in my family would seek to hold me back for ... the sake of pride? Still not sure.
I’m not going to name the field of study that I ended up getting a degree in from the other (admittedly pretty trash) BC school because if I did, there’s a high chance someone in the industry I work in would know who is writing this post. All I can say is that this field is pretty popular these days due to its ease of studying, but to me its absolutely mind-numbing, unfulfilling and rewards promotions to people who don't deserve them (i.e. friends and family of people in managerial roles). I had landed and completed numerous co-op positions while having not finished my degree yet and was “excelling” according to some. I was given a full-time job making more than most Canadians before I graduated. But my god, I knew I had to get out or I’d end up killing myself within the next five years. I knew this for sure the day that I walked across stage at my convocation and felt absolutely no pride or joy. I knew this for sure when I realized that I was just grudgingly going to work each morning, putting in the minimum effort needed at a super easy data entry job that, according to my boomer boss, most people “would love to have”, and going home each day to lay on a couch for 6 hours and wonder whether anything would ever change.
After the death of someone close to me in 2018, I realized how short life was and how I needed to act while I still could. I took time off work in 2019, went back to school for eight months and grinded at academics harder than I ever have before. It’s early May 2020 as I’m writing this, and I was just accepted to UBC Applied Sciences. The joy I felt when that admission acceptance email popped on my phone was unfathomable.","#13079

As a visibly east asian Canadian, I'm so thankful I go to a university that has a large asian population because I'm terrified how much my life is going to change once we return to school. I already get dirty looks when I go out and people make comments at me. I also keep hearing so many stories of people getting assaulted just because of their ethnicity so I'm really scared. I'm hoping that a larger asian population will help so that we can support each other.
Please, if you don't fully understand the pandemic, do not make assumptions. Visibly asian people are not to blame for the virus in any shape or form. I am absolutely no different than you other than I've probably travelled less and interact with less people because I'm an engineering student lol.

PSA for people living in Marine!!!
Some dude broke into my 4-bdrm apartment at marine drive in broad daylight and peed all over the bathroom floor. It was everywhere. On the floor, the mirror, the counters, and maybe the carpets too (we believe so). We filed a police report with the RCMP but they couldn't do anything except investigate and conclude it must have been a guy (you know, given the pee trail). I can't even imagine what could have happened if one of my roommates or me happened to be at home and the dude got violent or aggressive.
Please please please, for the love of god, lock your apartment doors. This goes for anyone, but especially those at marine that don't have doors that auto-lock. Stay safe out there :(","#13077

This is in response to post #13064 cause I’ve been at UBC for 3 years now and I’ve HAD IT with engineering students and their superiority complex. Idk what they tell engineering students at Imagine Day, but it seems like they inflate your egos 1000x by telling you that your major is superior and you MUST crap on other faculties any chance you get. I am in CPSC by choice, not because I wanted to do CPEN and “gave up”. And believe it or not, that’s the case for most CPSC students!! If we wanted to work with hardware, we’d be in CPEN. But we DON’T. We want to make software. I work my ass off and I LOVE what I study and it’s really not cool that you crap on my major just because you’ve got a fragile ego and the only way you make yourself feel better is by bringing others down. I have feelings too you know. Everyone is doing their best and trying to study what they’re passionate about, not what they think sounds the “hardest” so they can complain about their workload and scoff at other majors. I hope to see an end to this senseless major hierarchy at UBC. How about we be kind and supportive of each other instead.❤️","#13074

Not only will us 2020 grads not have graduation ceremonies for a while, UBC is making us pay to get our diplomas mailed by courier because of it.
Logged into SSC today to find that that the delivery option on the grad application (that I previously chose to be attending the grad ceremony) was changed to ""You have indicated that you will pay to have your diploma sent by courier.""
Thanks a lot UBC.","#13070

I would like to share a tip on how to reuse your hand sanitizer bottles. Place your lube in to an empty hand sanitizer bottle so you will have a discrete container to conceal your lube. So every time you beat your meat, you can squirt some lube onto your hands and jerk yourself to sleep.

Due to COVID-19, as an Asian Canadian person, I'm frankly kind of scared the repercussions that will come after quarantine is officially over. From people deliberately avoiding me, to increased racial slurs I would have to face from ignorant people, I can already tell it's not going to be a positive experience. As awesome as Canada is, there still are racist people, that decide just because I look Asian I deserve bad treatment. Let us please try, as a community, to stand up against racism, if it does occur, because at least on campus, we will have control over that. Yes, the Chinese government is responsible for ignoring all protocols regarding a potential pandemic situation, but I did not choose to be born an Asian person.","#13067

So much time was put into something I didnt even enjoy.
Honestly speaking all of my passions and hobbies lie in music, fine arts, literature, and even culinary arts. However fear of making stable income in the future is what made me apply to engineering (not to shit on arts, just personally thought Eng was a more direct route).
Now heading into summer, I have to take 3 summer courses across all 4 months to fill my first year requirements, and Im just losing all hope for motivation.

To be honest, I feel the EngPhys program is a scam. It's only really useful/interesting for students who want to do intense applied integrated research, alongside with the science co-op program that guarantees them a better chance for a co-op job.
If you want to get a job, and you want to do courses more centered on modelling, heat transfer and mechanics, DO MECH. If you want to do something more digital design, firmware, or pure software oriented, DO CPEN (maybe CPSC if you give up). If you want to do something that is more centered on robotics, firmware/SoC, sensors, power, or even research centred on electrical concepts, DO ELEC. ECE has a final year undergraduate thesis course,does EngPhys have that?
EngPhys basically makes you do a ton of Mathematics , Phsyics, ELEC and MECH courses that has no correlation to each other. At the end of the day, the only useful and most interesting stuff that EngPhys student find is that summer project course that does low level firmware- something you can do in ELEC/CPEN. Most of the time, I would see a final year EngPhys student trying to get into that CPEN 311, 333 or ELEC 402 course. Many of them would tell me that they really enjoy those topics, compared to all those other random courses they do in EngPhys.
TL;DR: Only saving grace about EngPhys is their SCIENCE co-op affiliation.

Message to Asians who consider eating out after COVID
If you are Asian, re-consider eating out after COVID is over. Use a fake name that wont identify your Asian ethnicity if ordering a take out.
I worked for a large bar chain after 9/11 terror. I have witnessed too many times how your ethnicity plays a large role to the quality of service you get. You really dont want to imagine what could happen to your dish.
'Particular' people in service industry and trades absolutely despise Chinese customers and they dont care if you are Japanese or Vietnamese or Korean. Many of them cant even distinguish between Filipinos and Chinese either.
Just like back in 2001 they didnt care if you are Iranian, Indian or Pakistani.
These 'particulars' are the same people who would push a 90yo man to the ground. They are more common than you could imagine.

I am deeply disappointed in the lack of support that UBC has been providing to their students during this COVID-19 crisis. As the term is coming to a close, I find myself extremely low on funds and unable to apply for the CERB because my contract as a TA with UBC does not end until April 30th but I still have to pay for housing on campus on May 1st. I wrote an email to both my ESA and year round housing and they basically directed me to each other saying that there was nothing that they could do. This is what UBC year round housing replied back to me with:
""We appreciate your message, but there is no rent relief or waiving of fees for the summer at this time.
The university is aware some students are seeking assistance with student residence rental costs. At this time, it is our understanding that students living in residence are not able to access support through the BC Temporary Rental Supplement. The university is on consultation with government on this question and will provide students with additional information as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, students who are experiencing financial hardship are advised to contact their enrolment services advisor for information on supports available through the university.""
I was even more disappointed, however, to hear my Enrolment Services Advisor recommend that I take summer courses and apply for more student loans without acknowledging the fact that not only would I then have to pay UBC tuition fees which are not even reduced even though all courses are online but that I have already taken out the maximum amount in loans for the school year and really do not want to take out more. I also cannot believe that this is the only 'solution' that they provided me with? With my mental illness it has been incredibly hard to focus on school even finishing up this term so taking summer courses is out of the question. It is moments like this where I feel sick about the fact that UBC cannot even help their students by waiving tuition/housing fees or setting up an instalment plan to help lessen the financial burden that students face during this time even though we get weekly emails from the university saying that they are here to support their students during these difficult times.

Cuz it’s a bigger question. After having been called non-straight so many times I’m wondering about myself. Because I like women, and I wanna fucc pussy but I’m also like confused about it like I “I wanna eat the apple pie but is that like the best thing for me??”
TLDR I’m confused sexually and reality tv is making me wonder.","#13053

Sometimes I question whether TAs are students/have been students or not... Do they not have any compassion at all? I had to submit a final paper for one of my courses that was worth 20% of my grade and at the bottom I was allowed to give myself 30% of my final grade (total I could allot myself 6% of my final grade). BUT this was written in super fine print on a super long pdf document about the assignment where it was talking about academic honesty and in the fine print that no one actually reads. I stayed up like 3 nights in a row and worked on this paper for over 30+ hours AND this was actually my favourite course and actually talked with our prof and TA.
FInal grades came out yesterday and my TA was like ""your final grade is unfortunate because you could have gotten an A in this course if you had put your personal 30 points on it."" HELLO like I get it, it was my fault for not reading the fine print but SHOULDN'T TAs HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF COMPASSION TOWARDS STUDENTS? Because I missed a simple number at the bottom of my paper I dropped an entire letter grade.
When I emailed my TA and asked if there was anything I could do to fix this, she was like ""sorry you should've emailed and asked earlier."" I was depressed for an entire day. I just wished that my TA was more compassionate towards students ESPECIALLY during this hard time for everyone. Have they never made a mistake before as a student???

I am a student with a disability and had a nightmare of a time in ubc social work. I took a break to focus on my mental health because while I was in this program, I was hospitalized twice. This never happened when I was in my previous psych program.
It’s not exactly my place to make accusations against other students and faculty. But I just want to let people know that they should be careful when transferring programs. And I don’t know how to deal with it, especially during the time that I was enrolled there. But for a faculty claiming to be “sensitive towards vulnerable and diverse populations”, I have never felt more discriminated in my life.
1. People would cry in class during semester 1, saying that they felt unsafe in the cohort.
2. We had a small group discussion about disabilities and this girl who was my disability note taker ranted about how she doesn’t want to work with the disabled population because they “won’t get better“
3. I had a panic attack before a presentation which was deemed unacceptable. The prof said I could make it up by carrying her poster board around for a public viewing. I felt this was unfair because a previous classmate came to that class and presentation intoxicated. And they were not penalized like I was.
4. My group project members told me the wrong times for meetings then claimed I never showed up. I was open with them about my health issues when I confronted them, because apparently they called me a nickname for being untimely.
5. A senior professor pressured me to tell her what my illness was while in her office. I was in a vulnerable position so I told her. I regretted it after because she said “you can’t be a social worker like this”
I feel very saddened by my experience as I worked very hard to get my GPA up and
my work and volunteer hours. That being said, there were some kind students and profs who actually cared. But overall, it was a disappointing and traumatic experience.","#13050

All those emails about we care about you and shit from UBC and not one thing has been done to actually help the students out of this stressful situation both financially and mentally. I really appreciate the credit/d/fail options and all, but like the University is still proceeding with it's tuition hike, not even giving the students a fucking chance to kind of make up for it by switching all the housing to winter session just for this year (exluding some students who don't have anywhere to go) UBC housing has fkn millions of dollars in revenue and resources, however, when it comes to students they somehow don't find that stash.
I can't even believe how hypocritical these emails and adressings to students sound when someone from UBC comes ups and repeats we care about you. DO NOT SAY THAT IF YOU CAN'T SHOW FOR IT.
If you still wanna do something for the students and their parents don't have any source of income or revenues, fucking make a way to save some money and don't be the greedy institution that you are proving to be.

Unpopular opinion, but I personally think UBC's tuition increases are valuable for UBC, just not during a pandemic. Maybe Peter Allard donated $30 million at one point, Walter Gage donated some respectable amount, and many other notable alumni have donated likewise. So I understand UBC has money right now. Yet UBC's primary source of revenue is tuition payments made by students.
Even though UBC receives funding from the provincial government, they aren't fully funded, or at least do not receive enough to not require tuition payments from students. Hence it is clear we need to pay tuition as students.
As for increasing it, every year there's inflation, which reduces the purchasing power of money previously obtained. UBC is rapidly developing and maintaining the school, hence inflation would impact the ability for UBC to grow as a school and continue to provide for students. Increasing tuition, at least a little bit, accounts for this. Generally the increases aren't higher than 3% of the total tuition, which is consistent with average case inflation rates.
Now if there is a mismanagement issue, where for instance some resources UBC provides are not well funded, that's a problem that will not disappear by keeping tuition costs the same. This is more directly handled by raising awareness and showing UBC that the general student population would like to benefit. Additionally these resources are likely to be impacted by inflation too, bringing us back to the previous point.
Finally there's the concern that the tuition increases will decrease affordability. This issue is quite complex as there are many factors at play. Most likely, even before tuition increased, there were those who had affordability concerns. The most apparent factor is the tuition amount, but less obvious is the government's investment in the school system and student loans, the cost of housing in the Lower Mainland, and the rising cost of goods. Most likely those who find tuition unaffordable are impacted by the other factors listed here, and so is UBC. These aren't things that will disappear even if tuition is not increased.
I do agree that we are diving headfirst into the greatest recession of all time, and that a tuition increase would be untimely now, but in general, people should not hate on UBC on other occasions when they increase tuition.","#13046

To all of those who believe you should be refunded for the fact that classes went online, online courses are harder to administrate. Upholding reasonable academic integrity comes to mind, since for instance if a professor wants to administer an exam, they cannot easily control collaboration or other forms of cheating. Another thing is reliably providing course content to willing students. Thankfully we have great platforms like Collaborate Ultra to help with this, but it doesn't necessarily replace in-class activities, and require regular maintenance. Yet another factor is how sudden the change was, and the fact that an alternate was sought and deployed almost immediately after UBC moved to online classes.
All you may have noticed as a student is that the material required materialised when you needed it. This is how abstraction works: the inner workings of a system need not be exposed for the system to function. Just because you don't see how UBC is providing for your instruction doesn't mean they are not doing a lot behind the scenes.
Let us all be more appreciative of our instructors, the IT department, and other UBC staff that did all they could to salvage this term, instead of thinking solely about ourselves.","#13045

Even though I was the smartest kid in grade 4 (and also a fortnite god), the professors are making my life utterly miserable. While you were going to frats, I mastered the integral. I have absorbed every word that was uttered in the math 101 lectures, even further enhancing my unmatched intelligence. But this new grading scheme, my mortal enemy, has made it impossible for me to sit in my throne, at the peak of UBC. my rightful position has been taken from me, because of the professors and their compassion? Empathy? Don't make me laugh. Those are just propaganda terms made by snowflake libtards who are too weak to acknowledge my superior intellect. How could they? How could Anthony Wachs betray me like this? My life has spiralled into an uncontrollable storm of perpetual suffering. It's over. Goodbye eng phys, it has been fun (I'm pre-eng phys btw). So yeah grading scheme bad.","#13044

Just witnessed a couple at Save On trying to buy groceries - I think they were both students. The girl really wanted to buy a cake for her boyfriend's birthday but from what I nosily eavesdropped, she was tight on money and couldn't get home to her home country because of covid. The guy insisted that he didn't need a cake, but she was adamant about it. He gave in eventually and picked the cheapest one, but she wouldn't let him. In the end, they got the cheapest one. It was small and in her opinion, not very pretty. But he was happy about it and insisted it was the one he wanted. Dear couple, in tough times like this, your little hushed argument (and I know I had no right to eavesdrop) gave me renewed faith in humanity. We often forget about the little things in life whenever we take things for granted. Today, you showed me that even when things are financially and circumstantially difficult, you still made an effort to make each other happy. It was so sweet. And I wish you both the happiest days to come.","#13042

I know that it’s tough that in times like these, we can’t just drive a car to our home, but have to fly thousands of miles amid travel restrictions and high risk.
If you ever feel homesick or lonely, remember; you’re incredibly strong and you’re not alone <3","#13037

Witnessed something beautiful today.
I work at Vancouver General Hospital and on my way to work I saw a man who’s car needed a jumpstart. No one was helping him but a lovely lady drove by and stopped her car to help. Neither of them had masks and tried to keep their distance while working it out.
In the midst of everything, this woman stopped to help a stranger. Take care of each other ❤️","#13035

To UBC,
You are great, really, there are many things that I adore about you. But during a time like COVID-19, do your staff really need to go around circulating parking lots and fining poor students who have PAID but over-parked by 1 minute? My parents came to visit me (at a distance), as I have not seen them often since classes moved online, and honestly, it is a little disheartening that even through a pandemic, the university's vigilance and focus is still placed on these types of things.
When the school offers to support students through the crisis in any way possible, this is not the type of support I was expecting to receive. Maybe next time I see my parents, I don't need to worry and sweat over being one minute past my paid parking time.
Stay safe, healthy, and happy everyone.","#13032

I'm a current student in the PharmD program and never in my life have I felt so unsupported by a faculty. Our Office of Experiential Education actually thinks it's a good idea to send over 600 students around the province during a PANDEMIC to do practicums. Every single other health care program has either suspended practicums or chosen an alternative to make up for it; meanwhile pharmacy students get shoved into new and dangerous territory. I honestly think that the Office of Experiential Education would rather just risk students' lives than come up with an alternative plan because many students have voiced serious concerns, and OEE's only solution is for those of us who feel unsafe to just defer our practicum for a later date. Meaning, NOT graduate on time. What kind of monster program does this to their students?!","#13030

I've been keeping a list and when the government sets up its fraud reporting hotline (like the one they have for Employment Insurance), I'm going to snitch them out.
Hopefully a few of them get criminal charges and never work in any sector that requires background checks, but the ones I'll delight the most are the international students who will be disqualified for post-grad work permit.
Most students don't even need convincing, they'll just tell me they already did it. Dumb move.","#13026

The virus and how some students choose to react to it has got me thinking.
How many students have fallen through the cracks of the support systems in place at UBC? How many students were let down by UBC personnel who were hired to give them guidance financially, mentally, academically, etc.? How many students were forced to walk through dark times alone even when they reached out to the proper people?
I reached out and asked what to do if I’m a student in financial distress. I don’t know how to pay for tuition, food, and rent. I was told to suck it up and find a job. I’ve been trying, but when there are about 50 other people applying for the same minimum wage jobs because so many people got laid off, it’s a lot harder than you think. I’ve been told to ask my parents for a bail out, which is the most out of touch thing I’ve ever heard. Both my parents were laid off and can’t afford to bail me out. All I wanted were suggestions for funding/financial assistance options and all I got were condescending comments telling me I was lazy and not trying hard enough. Sometimes UBC is a toxic place with no space for low-income students.
Can’t wait for the comments on this post telling me to leave UBC if I find it so toxic. Sometimes I forget good universities are only for the rich.","#13022

After seeing a lot of aggressively worded content from this page and among other places, I think we really should take a step back before we throw out those comments.
The covid 19 situation cannot be blamed onto some group of people even if they contributed more to the problem no matter which group that is. Sure they may have worsened the problem but if there's some group to blame it must be the existence of humans. Please don't make it sound like it's all one group's fault.
Also with the situation around our grades, there is no single ideal way to resolve the problems. There may be a way to resolve just your problems but please be considerate of how the same solution may totally messed up someone else. Unless UBC gives 4.0 GPAs to everyone (which I'm sure is unwanted for all you competitive students), there will always be people complaining about being fked by the new policy.
At last, my friends out there, keep calm and stay safe! Once we recover from this pandemic I hope both UBC and its students can learn something from these painful weeks.","#13021

God really has a cruel taste for irony, because what the actual fuck was He thinking when He meshed both homosexuality and islam into the same person. Having grown up in a MENA country (Middle East-North Africa, i.e. an Arab country), I can guarantee I received quite the dose of toxic masculinity paired with an acquired taste for internalized homophobia; a perfect recipe for a self-loathing closeted Arab guy. I wouldn't lie and say 'Oh it was so tough growing up gay,' because I had things pretty easy. I have always been closeted (thank God I easily pass as hetero) and will choose to remain so because of how difficult and inconvenient the alternative would be.
I remember coming to UBC thinking I'd finally get a break and perhaps consider coming out, maybe live two lives and spice things up. That's possible, but it's all too scary of a step to take. I remember looking towards LGBTQIA clubs and societies here, however, committing to those will involve outing myself, which once again remains the scariest shit ever. There is also a disappointing lack of discussion regarding the role of intersectionality when it comes to being somewhere on the spectrum besides straight. Also, I can guarantee the Muslim Student Associations and the Arab Student Associations, nor any cultural club pertaining to MENA/the Arab diaspora is a good resource to turn to, and I can't blame them. We do indeed share a culture of aggressively enforced heteronormativity, so discussions about queerness are almost impossible. If anything, within a Canadian society they turn awkward asf because on one hand, there is pressure to have far-left values and on the other are cultural and religious constrictions those values contradict.
Coming out for people like me isn't just a severance of ties to your family, (most) friends, and the immediate community. Nope, it's also a discord between your spiritual foundations and the life you choose to have.
To some, this may sound ridiculous. Why can't I just ditch Islam and move onto to one of the many thousands of options available? I'd live a happier life with a brighter future (I'd hope so). Unfortunately, I have yet a long way to understanding why. It really isn't easy foregoing a religion and a life style you've adopted and embraced for years. It is even harder trying to justify why you should remain committed to a religion that antagonizes and criminalizes the way you've been created. I think what leads me on is the hope that perhaps the way we culturally interpreted Islam is flawed. It is really difficult to argue a case against homosexuality within Islam without bringing up cultural norms and Hadith (kind of like Islamic lore, not a very guaranteed source besides a few narratives, but relevant nonetheless).
The reason I am writing this confession is because I know for a fact there are other queer Muslims on campus, and they need to know that they're not the only ones struggling with this situation. This dilemma is not exclusive to anyone, nor any one group, nor any one religion, it is so fucking universal. Things are just a bit more intense when stoning (no not hashish/weed) and social prosecution are involved, so show a little love to one another (particularly in the queer community), because shit's intense for some of us, whether Muslim or not.","#13018

I promised myself that before the end of this academic year I would submit a UBC Confessions post that unleashed a comprehensive summary of all the tea, shade, and BS I faced from the past 4 years being involved with multiple campus partners, clubs, student leadership positions, jobs, and so on. Today is what would have been LDOC, so I woke up with the intention to compile that filthy list and send it in.
However, I just came back home from a walk around campus alone today to ease the quarantine boredom…
And it made me realize how grateful I actually am for all the incredible experiences I have accumulated over my undergrad experience. Despite all the complications that come with being at a large institution (I still stand by my view that University is a money-mongering business that doesn’t truly have students’ best interests at heart), the people I have met and places I have been really shaped who I am today; the soon-to-be virtual graduate. Passing by all of the spots I frequented around campus throughout the years during my walk hit me like a truck. I could practically see myself from a snapshot 3rd person perspective laughing with friends by the gravel clearing near the Asian Library in 2nd year, lounging by the blooming cherry trees near Ponderosa’s chalk wall in 3rd year, poring over the Rose Garden ocean view in 1st year, and so much more.
Maybe it was the fresh blooms or warm sunlight that slapped some rose-coloured glasses onto my head today, but I can’t bring myself to write anything but sweet encouragement to anyone reading this that hasn’t yet graduated: times are rough now, but once this is all over, remember that your time at UBC is shorter than you think. Make the most out of it.. for your own sake.
TLDR - if you’re feeling salty, take a walk. (especially around the asian centre/vanier - everything there is in full bloom or about to bloom)

I promised myself that before the end of this academic year I would submit a UBC Confessions post that unleashed a comprehensive summary of all the tea, shade, and BS I faced from the past 4 years being involved with multiple campus partners, clubs, student leadership positions, jobs, and so on. Today is what would have been LDOC, so I woke up with the intention to compile that filthy list and send it in.
However, I just came back home from a walk around campus alone today to ease the quarantine boredom…
And it made me realize how grateful I actually am for all the incredible experiences I have accumulated over my undergrad experience. Despite all the complications that come with being at a large institution (I still stand by my view that University is a money-mongering business that doesn’t truly have students’ best interests at heart), the people I have met and places I have been really shaped who I am today; the soon-to-be virtual graduate.

Trigger warning- death
My great aunt and uncle both contracted the coronavirus. Both 90 years old and have lived a long and happy life. They have been getting treated on the same hospital floor in Toronto, 4 doors down from each other. Last night, my great uncle passed away. Before he was about to die, my extended family (his immediate family) video called in and everything to say goodbye due to the non-visitation isolation policy. My great aunt wanted to go kiss him on the cheek and say goodbye for the last time. They were married for 67 years. She was being treated for the same virus, 4 doors down, on the same floor, and the hospital staff wouldn’t let her go and say her final goodbye. She gets frustrated and says to her doctor, “If god is good I’ll die tonight too to be with him. If im not dying today, we all know i’m dying shortly after him regardless”. The hospital staff continued to state it was policy that she couldn’t go see him and that she had to stay in her room. My great aunt said goodbye and watched her husband pass away over video call from down the hall.
My family is more than likely not the only family experiencing this, and I can assure you that doing your part (in whatever capacity that may be) is much easier and less painful than what my family had to experience yesterday, and I sincerely hope your families don’t have to go through this either.
My message to literally everyone has to be stop fucking complaining about how difficult quarantine is and understand you’re safe at home, not stuck at home. Make sure you’re doing your part in helping combat this virus.","#13015

Hey so I live in Place Vanier and due to the quarantine I’ve been butt naked in my room almost every day. One night I heard some loud ass scream from a drunk girl and lifted up the blinds as fast as I could to see if she was ok.
Not only did it turn out to be a very high pitched drunk white man, BUT HE LOOKED AT ME AND COMPLIMENTED MY NAKED BODY. I closed the blinds, and hid under the sheets. Made me feel more confident but damn, he really saw the whole thing.
P.S if this is you... if you’re looking 😗🙄 I’m down if you are. #quarantineandchill","#13014

I was just watching movies, chugging wine and ordering away when I realised that didn't put a credit card in, or a shipping address.

I need to rant about Arts Co-op. I get that there’s not much job out there because of COVID-19. I’m sure coordinators usually work really hard to get internship opportunities for students. I was in Arts Co-op last year too and I saw opportunities still coming in until the beginning of May. But this year there are 20 jobs remaining and 10 are just straight copy-paste from LinkedIn and other 5 are expired jobs. This is lazy administration practice even considering corona. The reason why UBC keeps hiking tuition fees and pays dirt bag income to competent lecturers is because we have institutions like these. Arts Co-op there’s no need to make BAs even more unemployable.","#13012

I had drank a lot and really needed to pee, like seriously piss my pants. As we were walking I had absolutely no control over my bladder and started peeing, while wearing a SKIRT. I was wearing little booties and I just kept walking and peeing as if nothing had happened as the pee went into my shoes. The dude was so tall he didn’t even notice because we were talking and he wasn’t paying attention to it spilling down my leg.

The KUS was advertising their new merch, so being the naive little first year that I am, I dropped the big bucks on their glamorously malachite green gear. I was told to pay in person, so I ventured into the deep, dark, and dank caverns of War Memorial Gym with my friends. We paid our dues and were cast away, empty-handed. Our dreams of wearing the advertised merchandise was shattered. As the days grew longer, the sun began to shine, and the birds began to crow, we waited fervently for the great announcement. But it never came. Each day, the sun crept across the horizon before sinking back into its roots. One day, it wasn't just the sun; a new beast came in its wake, rearing its ugly head to proclaim its arrival. One by one the people locked themselves in. Women and children shrieked in terror as the beast run rampant across the land, its long and terrible claws cutting down people like flies, as it moved across the country. UBC, the prison of the northwestern coast, shut down; their great and glorious leader Santa Ono had abandoned the site as soon as the beast had appeared. Blind and terrified, the prisoners escaped the prison, never to return again. All that remained of the once-glorious promise of merch was trampled, stomped into ashes beneath the mangled feet of the beast.

Shout out to the Faculty of Science for deciding to screw over its students for no apparent reason by creating a new mandate that the final exam for a course must be either 30% or 5% and nothing else. Not only did they decide to do this during a global pandemic, but also halfway through the term!
Essentially, anyone that decided to read the syllabi at the start of term and prioritize certain exams over others, was completely misinformed about how their grades would be allocated and is now likely going to suffer for it. To put this in perspective, some of us had profs that specifically told us that if we did poorly on the midterms, they would re-weight them to the final if we performed better on that than the midterms. So, some of us decided to prioritize studying for other classes with midterms that same week. Well, now our grades are fucked, possibly fails, and even if we get to drop the course, it’s not like we get a tuition refund, or our time back. This is truly some of the most unfair bullshit I’ve seen UBC pull in a while.
Is this going to put unnecessary stress on students in an already stressful situation? Yup. Is this gonna make students suicidal? Yup. Are there any doctors available during this pandemic? Nope. How convenient. Thanks UBC.","#13006

I have a severe kink for Rick n' Morty. like sometimes it gets really hard to control to the point where I used to get so horny doing my wet labs because all the lab coats around me remind me of Rick Sanchez that I'd excuse myself after the experiment and just crank one out inside the washroom. I think I'm so attracted to Rick because I've always wanted to be dominated by someone who's both smart and an asshole at the same time which is how I ended up with my boyfriend. No surprise we roleplay a LOT as Rick and Morty and have our own ""20 minute adventures."" Since I'm the scrawny and shy one in the relationship I'd usually put on a yellow shirt and make Morty whimpering noises while hubby plowed me from behind in my lab coat but since he has a throbbing 7' pecker which was big enough to draw on I figured we'd go a little further. Yesterday I had some arts and crafts supplies laying around so I went to work painting his schlong alligator green and i hot-glued a pair of googly eyes onto it for good measure (he's uncircumcised but he's a masochist dw) so he could scream ""It's PICKLE DIIIICK"" before impaling me in the ass with his Alaskan-bull worm of a cock and I moan ecstatically every time. 10/10 would recommend.","#13000

Yesterday I had some arts and crafts supplies laying around so I went to work painting his schlong alligator green and i hot-glued a pair of googly eyes onto it for good measure (he's uncircumcised but he's a masochist dw) so he could scream ""It's PICKLE DIIIICK"" before impaling me in the ass with his Alaskan-bull worm of a cock and I moan ecstatically every time. 10/10 would recommend.",,1585852123,,,84,107,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3109351529083119&id=1287650764586547,

I have never ran for student governance. I have never been close with anyone running for student governance. But here I am, utterly disappointed in the way that student leaders have handled themselves this election season. Running for any sort of student position at a prestigious university like UBC, is commendable. It is really important that we create an inclusive and welcoming environment where everyone who wants to run for a position, feels supported by their community in doing so!
This year, the amount of harsh and personal remarks targeted at candidates running in the AMS General and Special Elections, has been disheartening. The worst part? The majority of these immature and simply hurtful comments, have been from incoming and/or outgoing AMS Executives.
Don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily believe that the candidate(s) in question are qualified. You're entitled to think that they're not. But there is a way to vocalize those opinions in a way that centres around a candidate's experience or perhaps ""too ambitious"" points, without being downright rude. This year, I've seen the AMS Executives gang up on a candidate or organization one too many times. It is almost as if no one other than those who have been involved with AMS since day one at UBC, are welcome in this ""exclusive club"" that is the AMS. One thing I've learnt: DO NOT RUN if you are an outsider and/or from an organization who the current AMS Executives don't like. Personally, any plans I had to ever get involved with this student government who supposedly exists for our betterment and support, is out the window.
Sincerely,
A sad UBC student asking the AMS to do better. The world is tough.Be kind.","*Sponsored by Simon Fraser University.

The ubyssey is worse at Handling emails then Hilary Clinton
Okay so here’s the story, I am a first year student somewhat interested in going into journalism. I learned about the ubyssey a couple weeks into the first semester and thought about getting involved. I went and filled out the form on the newspapers website and waited. I wasn't expecting much as I am only a first year, I thought maybe I could help research for the paper and do other general tasks. I thought I could progress to writing articles as I improved my skills naturally though university. I never got a response to the first form I filled out. I filled out the form again at the end of November and got no response. I still gave them the benefit of the doubt, so at the start of the second semester I went to their booth during clubs day. The people sitting at the ubyssey booth did not give a shit about getting people to sign up. I was very friendly and tried to start a conversation, these people slowly got off their phones and started talking to me like a chore. It was clear they did not care about getting others involved in the “student” newspaper. After 45 seconds of getting one word responses from ubyssey’s finest, I was prompted to fill out the exact same form that I have previously got no responses from.
The question I have, is how is the ubssey ever getting new members if this form doesn’t work. multiple friends of mine have had the exact same experience trying to get involved. Is the ubyssey just getting to get their friends join the paper ?
I am hopeful next year that this issue will be fixed but I don’t have much hope.","*Sponsored by Simon Fraser University.

I have a crush on a girl. I think. I keep wondering what her life is like and want to be close to her. I barely know her but she was so caring and affectionate towards me when we interacted. When she talked to me or made eye contact I felt butterflies! I didn't believe ""butterflies"" actually existed but it felt something like a shot of adrenaline in my stomach. It's been a long time since I've seen her but I still think about her a lot.
But I don't want to be feeling this way because I'm a girl too! You might think it's 2020 and feeling same sex attraction is no big deal but I can't get over it. Even if other people accept it, I can't accept it myself? I don't think (at least the majority of) my family would encourage it either. Also, I'm confused because I've liked boys in the past (like in high school).
After I started university though, a couple of guys have asked me out/expressed interest in me but I didn't feel anything for them. Sometimes I wish I already had a boyfriend to have a good/infallible reason to reject guys. What's wrong with me? Having a boyfriend shouldn't be just to prevent other guys from asking you out! I don't know if I didn't feel anything because we had no chemistry or if I don't actually like men in general. I'm so confused. I don't want to be feeling this.","#12997

Got forwarded an email from the AMS referendums people about why we should endorse it. They're being super sneaky with how they word the amendment that lets them hide documents. It's time for that VOTE NO campaign before people stuck at home vote without knowing
Here is their sneaky description of it in the email:
> Improve confidentiality by changing how records are disclosed
People more knowledgeable about this can chime in but my understanding is:
- They have tried to push this many times in the past, but it has failed justifiably
- They are trying again, hoping that enough people are at home and will vote without knowing what the contents actually are
- They snuck the ""confidentiality"" amendment in the middle of a lot of good sounding ones.

Here is the comment that quotes the section:
> Council will have the power to create a policy to designate as confidential certain records whose disclosure would be harmful to the AMS, third parties, ongoing investigations, solicitor-client privilege, or the secrecy of in camera discussions.
> For those who don’t know what this is: the AMS is trying to give themselves the power to lock any document they want from the student body and general public.
> I do not believe this isn’t a power a government appointed by the people should have. They need to be held accountable to students. This referendum is a direct attempt to limit transparency. I would encourage you all to vote no as well.

Sometimes I feel so helpless seeing snapchats, tweets, Instagram stories, etc. of people still congregating intimately outdoors, in shops, and on sidewalks.
Please know that those people are helping COVID-19 spread. People, especially those who are younger, may not feel sick or they may just have a slight cough, but the virus can still pass if they are sharing a joint, sharing a drink, or in close contact hugging, or playing basketball, football or hockey.
And you don’t know who you might accidentally pass it to — maybe a parent, or a grandparent, and it could be yours or mine.
I had the opportunity to listen to a friend talk about a patient of hers at the hospital diagnosed with COVID-19. And all she could remember after interacting with him dressed in full protective gear (hairnet, face shield, respirator, scrubs, and gloves) was him saying repeatedly, “I’m so scared. I’m so scared. I’m so scared.”
All she could say back at the time was “it’s going to be okay.”
Every death is a number, but it is also a relative, a child, a parent, and a cousin. It is up to us to stop the chain of transmission. Especially because we may not know that we are carrying it, though that isn’t to say that younger people aren’t being admitted into the ICU and recovering from permanent lung damage in some cases. More importantly, though, it is up to us to prevent this thing from reaching a loved one.
So the next time you want to have a friend over or meet up with them, think about the people you’re saving by saying no in person and FaceTiming them instead. Or if you have to meet, stay 2 metres away.
Staying away will save lives. It will save people. It will save health workers by reducing their frequency of exposure.
Staying apart will keep us together.","#12988

Most of the stuff we learn happens outside of the class, so I'm just wondering if other people have a different perspective to this?",,1585184428,,,80,32,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3095204963831109&id=1287650764586547,

I would like to tell a story of UBC East Hastings... (ponderosa) and I hope you join in.
First of all, for those going to do drugs on wreck... ponderosa is en route hence why it’s the East Hastings of campus.
So I volunteered to help out with move in day a couple years ago. And this mousy looking girl who looks to be 14 or 15 comes wandering over. She says she was on the beach, and doesn’t remember her name, and doesn’t remember where she lives. She has a phone number written in black sharpie on her arm. So we call it, it’s a friend of hers who lives IN SURREY and is coming to pick her up.... but she’s coming BY BUS so of course it’s going to take forever and I am asked to take care of this girl. So I’m talking to her, and trying to get some more info out of her. Apparently she did shrooms by herself on the beach. She keeps trying to kiss me and hit on me, and when I try to take her to the bathroom she ends up peeing herself.
I don’t think the volunteer coordinator thought much of it. I think he thought that from a heteronormative perspective, me taking care of this lost child made sense. But It was so uncomfortable trying to be a good volunteer while dealing with a high 14 year old hitting on me.","#12983

And to all the students whose summer plans got ruined and whose lives are temporarily going up in flames like mine, I guess we just have to remember that for the most part it is temporary.

But I didn’t get to say goodbye...

A big thank you to the profs who’ve shaped my mind, to the best of friends who carried me through this degree, and a general thank you to the city of Vancouver, without which I wouldn't have found so much love.
UBC changed my life.

Uncertainty and anxiety about your courses and grades are valid, but please put yourselves in their shoes and think about how stressed you would be if your job suddenly changed as much as it has now. We will get through this as a community. I think most students realize this but I've already seen some comments disparaging professors doing their absolute best on little to no notice. We all have family and friends to worry about right now, so remember to be patient and kind with everyone as we figure things out together.

With all the sexual assault related posts coming out, its good to point out the flaw in our society. People (including male and female) are not fully taught how to respect other people's personal space. Something as simple as putting your arm around a friend for a group photo may constitute assault even though it seems like such a normal thing to do. You do not have permission from your friend to do so, it is wrong to assume that you can, and you have no idea how that person may feel. Just because 9/10 people would be okay with it does not mean it is always okay. It never hurts to simply ask your friend if it is okay to do so. Embarrassment to ask is not an excuse to invade a person's personal space.
Another issue I find is the social discrepancy between what guys and girls are taught. Guys think that being confident means putting their arm around a girl or going in for a kiss without prior consent. There are girls who do find this attractive and would find it incredibly unattractive if a guy constantly asks for permission. But the biggest issue is that guys lack the awareness to determine when the girl has given non-verbal cues for them to initiate. Instead, guys go for the hard and fast rule of ""just go for it"" and if she pushes you away then its a no and if they do nothing then they want it. Just because a girl doesn't say anything doesn't mean its a yes. A word of advice to guys, if you are unsure, ask. NEVER EVER just go for it. If a girl finds you unattractive because you like being sure they are providing consent then clearly they aren't worth it.
Consent is the most important thing and it should always outweigh embarrassment or being seen as less confident or attractive. I hear way too many stories of guys doing something and the girl saying ""oh it was just a misunderstanding"" and brushing it off when in reality, what the guy did amounted to assault or sexual assault. Just stop.","#12972

Since everyone is submitting exposés about how corrupt our university is, imma jump onboard real quick
So I have been part of the AMS and behind its closed doors for almost two years now, and I’m just baffled by how corrupt our student government is.
There’s no system of accountability at all, and a huge lack of transparency. People don’t realize the AMS has an annual budget of $23,000,000 and if you’re part of it, you get lots of special ‘perks’.
I literally witnessed $600 dollar ‘ice cream’ parties and $750 dollar ‘pizza’ parties just thrown by our beloved student representatives. There have been cases of money just being embezzled by some who reimburse themselves for ‘AMS expenditures’
At many times I have thought of reporting such incidents to someone, however, given how our AMS has been structured, there’s no real way of reporting them without facing scrutiny and repercussions.","#12970

As a former contributor at The Ubyssey, and a current grad student studying journalism, I was startled to see so many people bashing The Ubyssey. Let me get some facts straight
Believe it or not, they're still one of the best student-run newspapers in Canada. I have been following news on The Ubyssey very closely and I'm sure they are doing a great job. One of their recent articles got Camp 5 to fix their sexist iron ring ceremony, which had been a huge issue for students. Their reporting on indigenous communities, Peter Wall Institute, faculty, student issues has been commendable. Most of you people don't even know what Peter wall institute is, but you guys are so quick to bash a student newspaper. Do you even know what happened with the Iron Ring ceremony? Did you even read their investigative story about sexual assault among medicine students? Or the piece about arts students wanting majors on their degrees?
Apart from investigative journalism, their coverage about academic freedom, lennon walls, clubhouse has been fairly according to journalistic standards we are taught at grad schools.
The voter turnout for AMS elections this year was freaking just 11%. And you guys complain about the people who people sit through the long ams debates? These people understand AMS much better than most UBC students because they attend council meetings every month, they go through all the AMS policies(like I17 which even one of the ams candidates didn't seem to know about).
I am proud to be a former Ubyssey contributor, and I will stay Ubyssey forever, and I am proud of the work these people have been doing!","#12969

The incompetence of the Arts Undergraduate Society continues to baffle me! The AUS has not uploaded meeting minutes to their website or otherwise made them available since OCTOBER OF 2019!? That's honestly not even that shocking given how incompetent student constituencies seem to be here on the ancestral, traditional and unceded territory of the Musqueam people but what makes it many degrees worse is we're supposedly in the middle of constructing an Arts Student Center (ASC) for the price tag of millions of dollars (and seemingly endless delays)! You'd think that a student constituency pushing for a much needed space for students would be super committed to engaging with their fellow students and faculty about the building, and roll in that sweet positive PR after literal YEARS of the AUS reputation being in the gutter but nope! Instead the Arts Student Center (ASC) page has been all but dead since NOVEMBER OF 2019. That makes my stomach turn worse than a first year hearing our faculty chant for the first time from an OL on Imagine Day.
And to pre-empt the bullshit talking points like ""well, get involved and change things!"" If your elections marketing consists of a couple of Instagram stories and an error ridden, half-finished website that's borderline un-navigable, you're going to struggle attracting anyone to run, and send those who value effort and a consistent work ethic screaming in the other direction.

Maybe the AUS should take a step back, and learn the basics of how to fucking run an organization before they take on something as monumental as a multi-million dollar construction project. Something simple, like... uploading minutes and maintaining a Facebook page.","#12968

Maybe the AUS should take a step back, and learn the basics of how to fucking run an organization before they take on something as monumental as a multi-million dollar construction project.

To the wandkid. Okay so I've been at this school for a 1.5 years now, and I've seen my fair share of weird shit, we all have I assume I mean it's university what do you expect? I usually just accept it, and try my very best not to judge people for their life choices, and usually I succeed. BUT, it has been several weeks now and I SIMPLY CANNOT GET OVER THIS. I've been thinking about it ever since and I need ANSWERS. Ok, so this happened a few weeks back. I was in the alleyway by Ponderosa, behind Mercante when I see two boys 20 metres away...and one of them is like pointing a wand (yes, a wand) out in the air. He points it at a tree I think? Or a building behind the tree?? And he's just standing there, waving his wand in the air super intensely at this tree. And then his friend comes into view, and I am looking for a wand in his hand, wondering if this is some sort of harry potter cosplay or I dunno? the second boy quickly looks in my direction, and I turn away and think it's none of my damn business don't judge, don't question it, just go, go, go. But now I'm thinking about it. I lie awake at night thinking of the wandkid. I have two theories. 1) cosplay, but they weren't wearing costumes 2) is there some fancy drone that can be controlled by a long slender looking controller that from 20 metres away just looks like a stick?

TW: Sexual harassment
There was a huge party last Saturday (7th March) full of the ubc men’s football team. Two minutes into the party, one of the football players who was standing near the entrance tried to touch my ass. Knowing what he was trying to do, I slapped his hand away. As soon as I did that, he had the audacity to slap my ass as I was waking out the door even though I LITERALLY SWATTED HIS HAND AWAY. That guy was legit standing there just so that he could do it to other chicks too. I felt enraged and disgusted and yelled at him when I saw that he was trying to do that to someone else. You know who you are and you should be ashamed of yourself. I hope your nut sack dries up and falls off. Fuck you.
Guys, please be careful whenever you go to a party or a club. Surround yourself with friends who you trust, who love and support you. Stand up against sexual harassers because the system is a scam and you’re probably not gonna end up getting justice even of you report an incident.
PS: I really wanted to use his name but I did not want to stoop to his level and cause problems.","#12964

TLDR: A rant on bathrooms
idk what it is about the math building but because I stay there sometimes, I've heard people say multiple times throughout the year that the toilet is overflowing. Something is going on there I swear. I've never heard of the male bathroom having similar problems but we really need a new math building. Also does it hurt that much to have warm water for hand washing...
Other times I have cpsc labs in the icics building. The male bathroom smells like people pee on the walls, or maybe they should design better algorithms for urinal flushing. It literally smells just as bad right after cleaning.
When I'm at ikb I avoid going to the bathrooms there, it's a high population density area with less than optimal sized bathroom. But nice design at the bottom of the door so I can open it without using my hands (please add to more locations).
At the end, I know this isn't happening but can we try to leave the next paper towel hanging out? If the dispenser requires spinning to eject the paper towel, will you kindly help to get the next piece out of the dispenser using your used paper towel? The next person will not have to use clean hands to spin the terribly placed spinner that way...
I wish UBC showed more love for their students. With the current sanitary conditions, if some dangerous virus pops out of no where we are all under grave danger.","#12955

I honestly find a lot of people’s reactions to the recent protests at UBC regarding the pipeline absolutely appalling and incredibly selfish. On the /r/ubc subreddit there were complaints of being hungry, wanting to go home, or missing a job interview.

It seems like many who were commenting see the world from a purely analytical and exploitative position, and I’m sure these same people will go on to contribute to the same institutions that vilify and abuse the minorities of this country.

Wholesome shoutout to the Blenz at Wesbrook Mall!
So storytime - I usually like this Blenz because it is a convinient distance from the main campus to take a break and walk to, but also on campus so I can make it back to class in time. Initially when I went there I'd notice this brown couple (who seem to be the owners) running the place. This detail because I myself come from a brown family that owns and runs a cafe and I just do not see many other people of my ethnic background in this business. Most brown people in the food industry I've seen either run your generic curry takeout place or a fancy fine dines - but not enough casual cafes.
So like the emotional sap I am I immediately made the parallel to the man behind the counter reminding me of my dad who is also a great barista, and the lady reminds me of my mom (generally managing front of house, and more chatty).
I've never mentioned about my family to them, but like my dad, this man behind the counter is generally not talkative but also very polite. He does not maintain very close relations or have long conversations with customers, but is generally asking people about their day and such. Also most of it is very genuine and not out of an obligation I find.
He'd ask me a little about my work and is generally chirpiest in the mornings! (My dad usually tells me about how he likes his morning customers best to talk to as well). The last time I got hot chocolate (medium) he gave me a large, saying he made a large one and if I minded that. I assumed it was accidental and happily took it. Today I ordered an iced latte (medium) and he asked the employee taking my order to charge for a small. I was a little surprised and asked him if I could pay full. He in his usual not very talkative but very warm way denied and smiled and then made me my drink. I am not too sure how I can thank him for this because I was just very happy (I just ended up tipping more but that seemed not enough in comparision because he was being so kind). Seems like an insignificant gesture but it stuck through my day :D
Basically this just made my day because I think they have a wonderful family and staff there. It also always reminds me of home and I am lowkey proud of seeing super cool brown baristas. Also my dad is a fan of making kids hot chocolate with generous amounts of chocolate and love, so he reminded me of just that.
Another part of this whole interaction is that I usually do not go to franchised cafes simply because my family owns a stand-alone independent one, and I am biased into thinking small independant ones have more struggles than that of a brand. I also come from a bias that brand name businesses do not have staff or customers that are passionate about their product and/or service. But this place pleasantly surprised me, and I think they're the only exception to my judgement :)
Tldr: If you guys go to the Wesbrook Blenz show them some love cuz they're pretty nice people :)","#12949

He'd ask me a little about my work and is generally chirpiest in the mornings! (My dad usually tells me about how he likes his morning customers best to talk to as well). The last time I got hot chocolate (medium) he gave me a large, saying he made a large one and if I minded that. I assumed it was accidental and happily took it. Today I ordered an iced latte (medium) and he asked the employee taking my order to charge for a small. I was a little surprised and asked him if I could pay full. He in his usual not very talkative but very warm way denied and smiled and then made me my drink. I am not too sure how I can thank him for this because I was just very happy (I just ended up tipping more but that seemed not enough in comparision because he was being so kind). Seems like an insignificant gesture but it stuck through my day :D
Basically this just made my day because I think they have a wonderful family and staff there. It also always reminds me of home and I am lowkey proud of seeing super cool brown baristas. Also my dad is a fan of making kids hot chocolate with generous amounts of chocolate and love, so he reminded me of just that.
Another part of this whole interaction is that I usually do not go to franchised cafes simply because my family owns a stand-alone independent one, and I am biased into thinking small independant ones have more struggles than that of a brand. I also come from a bias that brand name businesses do not have staff or customers that are passionate about their product and/or service. But this place pleasantly surprised me, and I think they're the only exception to my judgement :)

#12948
There are a lot of comments about sexual misconduct happening in the CUS but we need to also bring to light the sexual harassment that is happening in every day classes at Sauder. At the heart of business are people and the school fails to teach its students how to treat each other and how to help themselves when they are being victimized by their peers, instructors, employers, etc. Sauder is all about group projects - making everyone work together but there are NO courses or guidelines about sexual harassment during group projects or what to do if this happens to you. I am a female Sauder student who is being incessantly sexually harassed by a male team mate and I don’t know what to do. When I began speaking to my female friends at Sauder I learned that my experience is by far the most tame of what is happening. Sauder students are privileged and have never heard no in their lives. This extends to relationships and they ignore the boundaries that their teammates place. Sauder MUST provide sexual harassment training if they expect us to work in an endless loop of group projects. Considering the #MeToo movement has become so prolific in the media, I would think Sauder would clue in and provide some services but they don’t. Do better Sauder, educate your students on how to treat their teammates and how to protect themselves when they fall victim to harassment.","TW: discussion of sexual harassment and assault

Since everyone is talking about ways in which UBC robs us, here’s another:
The residence hall association (RHA, separate from RAs) gets about $115 000 a year to put on those events in residence, campus-wide. They also budgeted for almost half of that amount to be put into food for association members only, and for a couple of people to get all expenses paid vacations to other parts of the world for weekly “leadership conferences” which we all know are useless to anyone with a brain and common sense. They literally authorized to spend ~$40k to fly a couple of people to another country, pay for cab fees to the airport, rent and over $100 worth of food per person for a week. While I’m sure some people are going to justify this as useful as it “benefits residents at the end of the day”, it doesn’t. Most people have no clue what RHA even is, let alone get any benefit from it. And, of course, they budget for another $10k+ for food and gifts for the ~100-150 members for the year. I know a lot of poor students are living off instant ramen and, honestly, if I could’ve opted out of paying for this crap, I would have and I think a lot of other students would’ve too. We’re basically being robbed to help some people in this club pad their resumes. Thanks UBC.","#12947

I contribute to the Ubyssey. I'm not in the inner circle nor am I an editor, but I have some thoughts about the direction that the Ubyssey is headed in. In the past while that I've been involved, I'm incredibly disappointed to see the Ubyssey turn itself from a bastion of journalistic integrity and independence that boldly takes risks and doesn't take shit, to becoming a lazy mouth piece for UBC and the AMS. We used to have the reputation of being cutting edge, more cutting edge than every student paper in the country. Sometimes I get the impression that writers are just being lazy, by simply just drawing quotes from the easiest sources possible and the press releases tailor-made for lazy journalists.
It's also the clickbait. There's a real competition for getting clicks, but there isn't a drive to produce breaking investigations or features. Culture has definitely improved, but journalism has honestly gone downhill unfortunately. Sometimes it feels like we're just slowly bleeding dry, but I know my sentiment isn't shared by most people. Maybe I'm just a bummer to be around.
I think much of the Ubyssey really outdid itself this AMS election cycle. The laziness and lack of grounded meaningful analysis really shows. The Ubyssey chose to keep the conservative stance that any outsider candidates are idiots who had no idea what they were talking about, and insider candidates were the only people qualified to run the AMS. There's no risk-taking, no real consideration for whether those few months of experience make a difference. It's disappointing to see the Ubyssey actively prop up some AMS Insiders than actually making an effort to meaningfully consider the potential of some candidates.
The writing was slanted and the analysis really could've been better, but from all of this, it's clear the Ubyssey has no backbone for calling out incompetent incumbents, or willingness to consider if students with a few months of experience are truly more qualified to represent students. I don't know if anyone noticed, but none of the people running actually even have any real work experience, and as far as I can tell, virtually none of the student politicians running have ever done co-op or completed an internship. At most, they've played a lot of student politics at the expense of student fees. Here's a hot take: anyone who has done at least 8 months of Arts or Science co-op is 5 times more qualified than anyone running for an AMS position.
I hate to be writing this, because the people are fantastic. I'll get called out for not expressing my opinions internally and going straight to ubcc (reviled as it gets), but honestly I'd like others to know that they deserve better student journalism.
The Ubyssey needs to be more critical, it needs to take risks, and it needs to stop being afraid of taking shit on from people. Writers for the Ubyssey have historically been talented, driven, amazing and inspirational, and you still see this today in the Globe and Mail, at the CBC, whatever. This is not our best, and we can honestly do a lot better. And we can publish multiple crosswords too.","#12946

It's amazing how much SUS has fallen off these last two years. I've been a part of SUS for only 3 years but the amount of shit, or let me say LACK OF shit that has gone on this year is amazing. Like seriously where the fuck are the SUS execs and what are they doing??? I'm not trying to flame them but I'd like some responses in terms of what they've been doing behind the scenes this entire time in terms of events and ways to engage us as the students.
I know the VP external had his blue card thing but other than that, what the hell is going on? I've seen a few other smaller events but no other ones interesting at all. Like legit the VP Student Life, where you PLAN EVENTS FOR US has barely planned any events this year at all. I remember SUS used to have events at least every 2 weeks for students to engage in like 2 years ago, and now there's barely anything. Science Week was a mess lmao like what were those events in how boring they were. Was their no consultation with the students to see what they wanted??? You have literally 1 job: plan events for us, and you couldn't even do that
I'd like a few answers from the execs if possible, but I guess this is what happens when over half the positions had an uncontested candidate with little to no experience
Thank you SUS. I enjoyed my first year in SUS 2 years ago, but these last two years and especially THIS YEAR has broken my spirit and that of my friends too. I won't be going back with SUS and will actually find something worth while to do.

Would like to point out some expenses in which our student fees are being budgeted by the CUS:
- Board, Executive and Service Council get $12,000 for their retreats (they must be going to Hawaii)
- $3,500 for their apparel (gucci I guess?)
- $31,345 for awards night (a night where they talk about how great they are for 3 hours while all the financially strained CUS clubs sit and watch)
- $100,000 “contingency fund” which is 10% of the entire CUS budget (I’m assuming this pays for their groceries)
- and last but certainly not least, CUS clubs get $12,867 in funding which works out to about $1,000 per club (1/4 of the CUS merch expense)
Just wanted to bring attention to this in hopes that these can be modified in the next school year. It’s sad to see our fees be going to waste when there are so many passionate and hardworking students trying to plan amazing events and programs for their fellow students through our clubs.","#12941

Prepare for an ocean's-worth of salt:
Am I the only person that has serious touch aversion? For those that don't, it's similar to that recoiling feeling when smell something rotten (or when you step on seaweed while swimming in the ocean).
No offence and everything, but humans in general are SO gross.
The feeling of human contact is just a big no. And don't even get me started on that gross shiver that happens on transit when you brush up against some random stranger that could be carrying who-knows-what kinds of bacteria. (And then there's the whole COVID-19 thing.)
Yeah, no thanks.
It's even worse when you're stuck in a cramped space with someone that KEEPS PUSHING INTO YOU despite having at least TWO-PEOPLE'S-WORTH OF SPACE on the bus. Like, do you have eyes??????? Do you have legs???
I've never physically thrown up on anyone yet, but one of these days, I might. On a really bad day, the sensation of my nerves sending signals to my brain that I'm someone is touching me might just do it.
Touch aversion aside, humans are just disgusting (and I'm not even going to talk about BO - which is another thing entirely). I've been coughed on SO many times in the past week alone, it's a miracle I haven't contracted anything yet.
I don't know if PDA (especially people making out) on transit is worse. You know that there's more bacteria in the human mouth than in a public urinal, right? Can y'all share germs elsewhere? Not in front of me when we're all packed like sardines? When I can hear that gross, moist, mushy sound? When I can't move away?

So a few months ago I bought my girlfriend a cute bamboo plant for our 6 months anniversary. I picked a bamboo because my girlfriend's room had poor lighting and any plant in there could not receive proper sunlight. I had gotten her a plant before which died due to that very reason. Anyway, she had to go back to her hometown for the summer so she entrusted our plant to the UBC Botany Enthusiast Club. They had a program that was supposed to take care of your plant in the summer and return it back to you when you come back to school. When she came back, they said it would take about two weeks for them to sort out the plants and return them to their owners, which was very reasonable. But then we got an alarming email, apparently the ""exec"" in charge of the summer care program had quit. So no one was watering the plants and as a result, most of them had died. And they still did not know which plant belonged to each person. So we had to go identify our dead plants' containers. Obviously they had already emptied them out, I cannot imagine how my girlfriend would have reacted if the dead plant was still in the pot. In the end, she got a dirty pot back and a Ziploc bag with 5 basil seeds as compensation.

So a few months ago I bought my girlfriend a cute bamboo plant for our 6 months anniversary. I picked a bamboo because my girlfriend's room had poor lighting and any plant in there could not receive proper sunlight. I had gotten her a plant before which died due to that very reason. Anyway, she had to go back to her hometown for the summer so she entrusted our plant to the UBC Botany Enthusiast Club. They had a program that was supposed to take care of your plant in the summer and return it back to you when you come back to school. When she came back, they said it would take about two weeks for them to sort out the plants and return them to their owners, which was very reasonable. But then we got an alarming email, apparently the ""exec"" in charge of the summer care program had quit. So no one was watering the plants and as a result, most of them had died. And they still did not know which plant belonged to each person. So we had to go identify our dead plants' containers. Obviously they had already emptied them out, I cannot imagine how my girlfriend would have reacted if the dead plant was still in the pot. In the end, she got a dirty pot back and a Ziploc bag with 5 basil seeds as compensation. I understand the person in charge of the plants were at fault and the responsibility should not be on the entire botany club. But I just wish they had better organization and communication because she was left clueless and sad about the plant for about two months.

I was at a board meeting and the topic of business ethics came up. Awkwardly enough, someone brought up Sauder’s CUS. In a board meeting with people in the age range of 21-50, you can tell the disappointment and shock through the disgusted looks on their faces. Tea was spilt in a meeting room in downtown, just imagine the reality students are seriously going through in the Henry Angus building. With all the shit being revealed, the CUS seriously needs to fix their shit.","#12935

To the students in CS, Engineering, and Life Sciences majors,
After going to BCIT, I now feel how underrated this institution is. I'm still a UBC student but I'm taking some courses at BCIT. I was wearing my BCIT hoodie and this girl from UBC was treating me like a fucking inferior. At least I have a co-op lined up, and let's just say that even after many of us graduate from UBC, we have to go to BCIT somehow get a ”job.”
Most importantly, I am actually doing some hands-on work, not skipping or sleeping during lectures, or watch profs do demonstrations. Let's just say that the instructors are always there to guide you. I don't have to wait in a line for 100 something students to finish asking questions.
Don't mean to offend anyone, but facts are facts.
Sincerely,
A proud BCIT student","#12932

When we first met they told me how to properly pronounce their name and I am sure over our first few times hanging out I had asked them x amount of times on how to say their name (in my defense I am really bad with names). We don't are in faculties so I don't always see this friend and as time went on I forgot how to say their name. Now that we've been friends for 4 years I honestly feel so bad that I don't know how to say their name properly and I feel like it would be such an insult to ask again now. So every time we hang out now I try my best to avoid using their name so they don't find out that I'm a shit friend that doesn't even know their name.","#12931

It's been kind of sad to watch the Ubyssey devolve so much into meme-journalism and away from investigating and breaking stories. There's so much going on at this university, it feels like stories are tacked on purely for clicks, or to provide the AMS with a platform to publicize their talking points. I don't know about everyone else, but I've seen more hard hitting pieces and newsworthy events posted on UBC Confessions and on the UBC Reddit than on the pages of the Ubyssey since I've been a student here.

Okay so about 6 weeks ago I got into a pretty severe car accident which resulted in a broken rib, a concussion, and pretty bad whiplash. When I went to the hospital, they advised me to take about 2 weeks off so that i could heal from my concussion and to take it easy. If my symptoms were still bad, they told me to take more days off and ease back into going to classes. BUT. UBC IS ABSOLUTE SHIT. When I told my academic counsellor about my situation and emailed all of my profs, they just said ""Your assignments won't be cancelled, the deadlines will just be pushed back. The weight is the same. FOR. ALL. 5. OF. MY. COURSES. So of course I only took like 4 days off because I have to keep my grades up which SIGNIFICANTLY worsened my condition and made me feel like shit every day. So a word to UBC—don't say that you want to make students feel safe and mentally/physically healthy when you really don't. I've been going to physio 4 times a week and my therapist told me that added stress and sitting down/studying for a long time would only worsen my condition, but UBC really doesn't give a fuck.
Thank you for my world class education","#12927

This confession is regarding AMS Presidential candidate Ian Stone. I first got to know Ian when I joined Sigma Chi a few years ago. During my time as a pledge he was our Magister which basically means he ran the whole pledging process aka stuff like educating us about the fraternity's history, traditions and values (lol). I could tell you about how he treated us like complete shit and actually seemed to take pleasure from the hazing activities but hey that was all part of the ordeal and totally forgotten by the time we were initiated. Instead, I'm going to tell you about a conversation I had with him during that time which revealed his true character to me. Once a week we host an exchange night with a sorority which is basically a big, fun drinking game. As pledges we'd get a whole spiel from Ian and other Execs about how to act and behave around the sorority girls, etc. A lot of shit about being gentlemen and holding ourselves to high standards because after all we were in Sigma Chi . These events usually wrap up by 2am but this one night was a pretty rowdy one and people were still hanging around and drinking at the house past 4. One of those same Execs lecturing us about integrity and moral standards was quite clearly blackout drunk by then, and had spent a good chunk of the night prowling around one of the newly inducted sorority girls, a freshman. I saw her try and leave the house multiple times, but this guy kept telling her to stay, literally even physically pulling her back. It was flirty at first, but as the main floor of the house started emptying out, I realized something didn't look right. He was obviously frustrated that he hadn't sealed the deal by then and kept making remarks about going upstairs. Eventually, he practically pulled her by the arm away from the dancefloor and upstairs to his room. This chick was pretty fucking drunk by this point, but even then it was so obvious she wasn't intent on staying at the house, let alone go to the guys room (hand't even hooked up beforehand). This sounds fucked but as I was still a pledge and had just seen a few good buddies get kicked out of the pledging process recently, I didn't really react at the time. A few days later I spoke to my big about what I'd seen, and he basically told me something along the lines of ""it's great that you trusted me with this, i'm sorry you felt uncomfortable about this"". That night at the house was one of our last pledge education sessions, run by our one and only Magister. At the end of the session, Ian pulled me aside and told me to come speak with him upstairs. My first thought was that I was getting booted out of the pledging process because it wasn't usual for him to interact with us outside of the sessions. Instead, he gives me a lecture about the conversation I had with my big, telling me that part of joining Sigma Chi was learning to separate the ""internal issues"" of the fraternity with the greater Greek community, especially when it came to the executive team. In other words, shut up about this. Again, at the time I didn't really want to risk my chances of joining the frat when initiation was barely a week or so away. So I smiled and nodded, and that was really the end of it. Although I've graduated and only really stay in touch with a handful of my ""Brothers"", I still remember the way he dismissed any idea of unethical behaviour (let's just call it rape) if it meant harming his obsession with the image that we were the most elite and exclusive of the fraternities. This is not someone who should be in a position of power, nor does he give a flying fuck about the well-being of the community.

In astronomy class the prof mentions how its relatively common to see the northern lights if you're on a flight from Canada to Russia because of the path the planes take, but not as common if you're flying to east Asia because those planes tend to take a more southerly path.
Now this guy in the front row, who is somewhat notorious for derailing lectures, puts up his hand and asks if that isn't racist against Asians because they wouldn't have a fair chance to discover the northern lights. The class chuckles at the joke, but the guy whips around and stares everyone down. He's dead serious.
Silence falls. He awaits an answer. Prof has to tell him that people have actually known about the northern lights since long before planes were invented, and that planes aren't a requirement for seeing them. Guy maintains that now that there ARE planes they should be flying in paths that give equal opportunity for Asians to discover the northern lights.
Prof suggests they talk about this further in office hours. Class maintains a somewhat shocked silence for the rest of the lecture.","#12924

In short: Arts Advising fucked me over
In my first term of my final year, I asked them to look at my registered courses and see if I was good to graduate and the end of the academic year. The guy I was assigned to looks at it for not even a minute and said, YEP LOOKS GOOD! YOU'RE SET! I was like damn that's fast, I asked him if he was certain and he said yep! I thought alright I'll trust him, he's here for a reason, he's doing his job.""
Come second term I went again, different person this time, an old lady who actually read the guy's notes on my transcripts, and also looked at my transcripts for a good 3-5 minutes. Responded and said, ""ooohhh I see what he missed, he forgot to add on this component!"" I ended up having to stay another fall term. The lady actually apologized on behalf of the guy but the damage is obviously already done.
How can Arts Advising be this negligent about student's transcripts!? Some people have financial difficulties, had work plans, family plans, all sorts of life paths to figure out. It's not like graduation is like going from middle school to high school. I'm fucking going into the workforce. What if someone had the same intentions only to find out in April that they couldn't graduate!? Adding on to that my family thinks I'm just covering up the fact I failed some classes, so cheers to that.

I recently attended nwhacks and it's safe to say I will not be going to another hackathon anytime soon. I am absolutely disappointed in the hackathon community. The amount of waste these people produce is ridiculous. Hundreds of stickers and T-shirts given out to people who are most likely gonna wear them once. Not to mention all the food waste and disposable plates and cutlery. And this is happening EVERY year in hundreds of hackathons held around the world. Please stop going to hackathons until they start taking the environment more seriously. I'm not just talking about asking people to bring reusable containers which seemed to be the idea at nwhacks. I'm talking no more T-shirts. No more stickers. These are absolutely unnecessary. Just because other hackathons give out swag doesnt mean you have to do it too. The change has to start somewhere. The nwhacks team has another hackathon coming out in March. If you see this post before then please don't go or if you do please don't accept the swag they give out. They need to start taking this seriously.","#12921

First they let some member who has a conflict of interest ask for funding on behalf of NIBC and how the other candidate who lost the presidental elections is trying to scam their way into free flights??? Im sorry but JDC West competitors had to pay for half their trip themselves...why should I let you waste my student fees and take that opportunity from competitors who are my friends too. They are pissed that you already got a free flight to the competition back in January which wtf why did you even go? You had no reason too and same with the current CUS president. It's not like the both of you did anything there. Board members dont know what the fuck they're doing - i swear all of them either dont care enough or are in it for clout, i havent seen or heard of 90% of them. I hope whoever becomes next year's president does a better job than this year's - you've let everyone down, you havent supported student's views, you've made yourself unresponsible for your team's actions by not stepping up and doing your fucking job and being a leader. espeically because it seems like these dumbasses can't guide themselves.","#12918

I like to catfish people on dating apps. It’s just I never had the courage to talk to people I like by being the real me. I am unattractive, ugly, not smart, out of shape, lonely and I have nothing interesting. There are people who are completely the opposite and I know they would not give me the time of day. By being a catfish, for the first time, I finally get attention and compliments. Sometimes, we would talk all night and I’d laugh like a schoolgirl in love, but I know that eventually, my online relationships would have to end because they almost always lead to offers to go on a date, which obviously I have to reject. I don’t want them seeing the real me. I want to remain behind the beautiful image of the person they think they’re talking to.
I want to stop it and I will. You’re probably thinking that what I do is terrible. Yes, it is and I guess I deserve to be alone.
P.S. Make sure you verify each person you talk to by asking for their social media or having them take a random photo (three fingers held up, for example). Any excuses to do any of that mean that they are very likely to be catfish.","#12915

I understand that being victims of sexual assault and harassment that we want to stay anonymous and private, so that’s why I’m going to SVPRO to give an anonymous statement towards his predatory behaviour. It would be even better if you do the same as well, because all of our statements together act as concrete evidence against him.

TW: sexual assault
So there were two confessions made recently. One was about three boys being kicked out of the Portfolio Management Foundation (PMF) in Sauder recently and another about a sexual assault that occurred at a Commerce Undergraduate Society event. What you might not know is that these two confessions are connected. These three that were kicked out of the PMF were outcasts in Sauder and generally disliked. They would constantly go to parties with first year girls (they're all fourth years) and brag about how they were in this exclusive program to try to take advantage of them. One of them, let's call him “NO” (because apparently he doesn't know what that word means) was the worst. I met him in my first year at UBC and he tried this whole routine on me. From what's circled around Sauder, he was at the afterparty of this CUS event (that he wasn't invited to/knew no one there) and made advances towards another UBC student that was overly intoxicated and could barely stand up. Even in her state, she kept telling him no but he would not stop. Multiple people saw this happening but did nothing. He kept groping her, grabbing her, and attempted to kiss her but she pushed his face away. He still didn't stop until security guards came and scared him. On top of that, he was feeding other first-year girls so much alcohol, with the intent of getting them drunk so he could take advantage of them. With so many CUS representatives that were present at this event, I do not know how he has not faced consequences seeing as he is also someone in a position of power within the organization. From what I've heard and what he did to me in my first year of UBC, I was so angry but I felt I could never do or say anything because he was so much older than me, involved in the CUS, and was apart of the PMF. This was only one time. I know this happens often because it's almost become a joke within Sauder. ""Oh look, NO's doing it again. What are you going to do."" Him and all his friends are disgusting pigs. Now that he's in his final year at Sauder, I feel like I can't let him get away with what he's done to so many other girls but I don't know who to report it to because the CUS has done nothing about it. In fact, the incoming CUS president is best friends with him. I always see people from the CUS writing back to reply to confessions and I hope one of them replies to this. If I can't take it to the highest authority within my student organization, who am I supposed to talk to? I know there are other girls who this person has assaulted, because it seems like every Asian girl in Sauder has a story about this guy. I'm asking you to share your experiences, here anonymously on UBCC or any other way. You're not alone.","#12911

I'm living in Place Vanier and I just cannot understand some people around here. Before I start ranting, I want to say that it's 4 am rn and my brain is not working properly and thus I'm so sorry if my grammar is garbage and this post does not make any sense in general.
Why the hell in the world would someone need to speak that loud, for that long, at that early in a floor lounge that is not even yours?
Yesterday night, I came back from the overnight event that I barely got any sleep so I desperately needed a quality bedtime. I went to bed around 11 pm and I woke up at 1 am because a group of people was screaming on my floor. Ngl, I thought there was a murder happening or something. Because, well, otherwise, who's going to scream in the middle the night? I tried to tolerate their noise for an hour and also left a note to ask them to be quiet, but they did not get any quieter. Not that, but when I left a note, they crumpled it without hesitation and started to talk louder. I wasn't able to understand why they were saying because they were using their own language, but now that I think of it, maybe they were screaming some sort of swear words or something.
Anyways, the problem was not solved and I tried to call the RA on duty to ask if they can solve this problem. I called them three times, and all three times, they rejected my call. Not ignored, but rejected. I was able to hear someone picking up a phone but just decided to hang up right away, without listening to anything from me. I know it was really late and I also feel very sorry to call you that late, so I don't want to blame you for anything especially since I'm not sure if that's the duty of RA on duty. I just wanted to thank you, whoever you were, for leaving me at that hell for another 2 hours and thus making me hate this place more than anything.
This nonsense actually has been around since the beginning of the school year, and I've talked to RAs about it multiple times. And they tried to quiet them down but after going to them for the 5th time, I knew this will not work out.
Also, I didn't want to talk to them directly because they were a group of 5 I think, and I was by myself, and I didn't want to risk my safety. Also, I have to say that the fact that they crumpled my note right away quiet violently made me worried more about my safety if I would go talk to them directly.
I really want to know if anyone has the same problem as u do, and if so how did the person manage to handle it?
It's 4 am and I can still hear them talking and speaking. It's not as frequent and it was before but constantly hearing a burst of laughter, scream, swear words, and other voices every 15 minutes or less. All I wanted was a peaceful night during the reading week after getting a total of 6hrs sleep for the past two days. Please send help to people...","#12904

Because, well, otherwise, who's going to scream in the middle the night? I tried to tolerate their noise for an hour and also left a note to ask them to be quiet, but they did not get any quieter. Not that, but when I left a note, they crumpled it without hesitation and started to talk louder. I wasn't able to understand why they were saying because they were using their own language, but now that I think of it, maybe they were screaming some sort of swear words or something.
Anyways, the problem was not solved and I tried to call the RA on duty to ask if they can solve this problem. I called them three times, and all three times, they rejected my call. Not ignored, but rejected. I was able to hear someone picking up a phone but just decided to hang up right away, without listening to anything from me. I know it was really late and I also feel very sorry to call you that late, so I don't want to blame you for anything especially since I'm not sure if that's the duty of RA on duty. I just wanted to thank you, whoever you were, for leaving me at that hell for another 2 hours and thus making me hate this place more than anything.
This nonsense actually has been around since the beginning of the school year, and I've talked to RAs about it multiple times. And they tried to quiet them down but after going to them for the 5th time, I knew this will not work out.
Also, I didn't want to talk to them directly because they were a group of 5 I think, and I was by myself, and I didn't want to risk my safety. Also, I have to say that the fact that they crumpled my note right away quiet violently made me worried more about my safety if I would go talk to them directly.
I really want to know if anyone has the same problem as u do, and if so how did the person manage to handle it?
It's 4 am and I can still hear them talking and speaking. It's not as frequent and it was before but constantly hearing a burst of laughter, scream, swear words, and other voices every 15 minutes or less. All I wanted was a peaceful night during the reading week after getting a total of 6hrs sleep for the past two days.

To the assholes who have something other than a stick up their ass and were shouting on the fourth floor of Tweedsmuir House on Valentine’s Day,
Fuck you. What kind of mother fucking audacity do you have to scream and chant “FUCK RAs” at 1:30 in the morning?! And you have the balls, or lack thereof, to want to fight an RA when he politely asked you to leave?! Do you know what it’s like to hear a motherfucking fight between guys in an all girls house, or just wake up to guys screaming? There’s a reason why some of us in an all girls house.
You inconsiderate assholes should think about what you do before you do it; it doesn’t matter if you’re drunk, high, or stoned, just have an ounce of decency and respect for others. You’re at UBC—have some fucking self-respect. If you don’t, you might as well go to SFU, or better yet, KPU.
If it’s attention you want, go to daycare. I’m sure they’ll give you brats plenty of it.
Sincerely, and fuck you,
the girls in Tweedsmuir.

In addition to a somewhat old post re: TAs in a 100-level CPSC course.
I don't know if it's just me, but a lot of the TAs in this particular CPSC course I'm taking are so impatient and condescending. I know they know all the answers to our questions, and I'm aware that they have a policy where they can't give away any direct answers. But GODDAMN. I'm not asking for a direct answer. I want to figure it out myself too. But can they even understand basic English? Are patience and basic manners out of the question in CPSC courses? I've read through a lot of questions on Piazza, and I can honestly say it confuses me even more than before I went on it. Either they completely miss the question asked, or they'll resort to saying ""read it again"". That's super helpful, as if I haven't already re-read everything the last half hour. Does it really hurt to give students a small push in the right direction? Listen Linda, I'm not looking to be spoon fed here. I'm here to learn and I do the work by myself. I don't resort to going on Piazza for help unless I've tried everything else independently. But sometimes I get lost, and I could use a little help. That's all. I've asked my friends taking the course with me and when they post questions online, they all notice there's a subtle snide tone about the way they answer. Haven't the TAs also been through this learning stage when they were taking this course, where they don't understand the problem and needed some guidance too? Just because they're in a place where they get everything doesn't mean anyone who doesn't understand is dumb or lacking in any way. I just wish they were more understanding and patient. For some, it can be really discouraging. And others, very frustrating.
I've come into this course super excited to delve into a new area of knowledge. And I still do enjoy it. But the people in this field are not exactly who I'd like to be around. I hope people who work in this field aren't all like this.
TLDR;
I will only go on Piazza for my CPSC course if I'm looking to get shit on.","#12900

I'm so sad and so angered by what has happened. Read post #12857 and #12838 regarding the election posts of a candidate, seeing the results, and it made me feel like I finally felt less alone - but also so fucking upset and mad that I wasn't the only one.
I think we're all talking about the same person. Super friendly, so nice and helpful, until he started guilting me for not reciprocating him. Looking back, our ""friendship"" was all a cover for his predatory behaviour and his taste for asian girls. I'm so sad that someone like that is now going to be so prominent on campus. This alone with his bragging, arrogance and creepiness.
If anyone is reading this, I hope you stand up for the right things. If your friend is a creep, is predatory, is purposely hurting people - say something. Call them out!!! Don't normalize this fucked up behaviour. Please. I'm begging you.","#12897

I might get backlash for this but hear me out. The way UBC Engineering is trying to recruit more women into engineering is very questionable. There is funding going into event and painting this glorifying picture of UBC engineering as a happy and accepting case, when that is the opposite of reality. There is still blatant sexisms from profs and TA/s. However there is no way for anyone to take this seriously because the majority of higher ups are male. Sure there are a couple of women here and there but they are wolfs in sheep skin. Prospective students should be given a chance to sit in classes for a week for getting a taste of the atmosphere before applying to UBC.","#12896

I don’t understand clubs at UBC sometimes, ESPECIALLY on clubs day. I thought the idea was that you go talk to the people the booths for the clubs you’re interested in, and they’ll tell you a bit about it and then you can sign up or whatever. But almost every single time I’ve gone to one of these booths for a club that sounds super fun and that I’d love to get involved in, the people there look at me like I’ve just stood on their table and taken a shit all over it. I say hello, and they’ll look a bit caught off-guard but say hello back, and nothing else. Maybe it’s just me, but it seems like I’m always expected to lead the discussion rather than them, which seems bizarre because I just want to know what they do in their respective club and assumed they’d be the right person to ask since they’re representing their group on CLUBS DAY (which is MEANT to attract new people, no?). I guess what I’m getting at is that most of the people participating in clubs day, in my experience, are not very approachable at all and make the whole experience a bit uncomfortable. For myself, I’ve been wanting to get involved in a few for awhile, but I’m always put off by the idea of having to have such weird fucking interactions with people who almost give off the impression that they don’t want you there. Unless I’m completely misunderstanding how clubs day and clubs in general work at ubc, it all seems very off to me. Why are you there if you aren’t going to make any effort to engage people who clearly WANT to be a part of the group?","#12894

This was back in 2017 and I was only grade 11 at the time. I walking on grounds to track and field event that UBC was hosting, during that time getting off the bus I got lost and realized this place looked like a city. Saddest part was I was nearly late for warm up and eventfully I missed my event, as the sunset fell, I finally found the track after walking for an hour, I saw no point being here. Walking back I stopped by the building called ""Life's building"" which had a starbucks were I just sat there and looked for the nearest bus station. A young woman approached me, blonde and blue eyes, I can only remember them because she was acting very odd, I looked at her my eyebrow up and noticed she had an audience from the distance, she asked me as she approached me ""Do you go here"" within seconds, my geeks went red and I was socially awkward person, I didn't know what to do but i replied with a ""yes, I do, I study engineering"" the woman sat down with me and started conversation. This was prob the most uncomfortable moments of my life, it was pure silence and the woman continually asked me weirdest questions like ""Were do you live?"" ""What's your favorite position?"" or ""Are you an virgin"" I honestly had no fucking idea what to say or do other than to hold her off as the bus was coming 15 minutes. I replied to them quickly and short, but before I can get up to leave she quickly grabbed my geek and layed her hand on my neck started kissing me. I don't know about you people, but I don't think I felt disgusted by having someone's tongue in my throat, I was very submissive person and after 4 minutes making out, I briefly let go and said I need to go. She said ""no"", I looked at her ""oh really?"" the next thing you know, her two friends follow along and start walking to this apartment across the building, we end up in the stairs, and at this point I'm fearing for my life, in my head I'm thinking ""Alright, I think I'm gonna lose couple kidneys but it was a good life till it lasted"". Getting to the door, one of the girls started grabbing on a no no spot and the other went to the washroom. The blonde girl throws me in the bed and I think i woke up the next morning with three girls in bed and 25 missed calls from my dad. We didn't talk much other than they had to go to class, but the blonde girl and I had breakfast, talked about yesterday and how everything went, and to be honest that was the craziest experience I had ever endure in my life. I bused home and was grounded for a month, I haven't seen the girls ever since and I'm proud to say that UBC was were it happened.","#12884

What I do not support is the way they handle complaints about members involved in their organization. One of my friends also in the CUS said there was an incident at NSCC where another member sexually assaulted her but have they done anything about it? No. I don’t feel safe seeing him around school and wish something could’ve been done already","#12883

So basically I own two clickers and when im in class I click both of them and my teacher see that there are 89 people in the class. The next time she asks us a clicker question in dont click one of them and she waits there for an extra 20-30 seconds waiting and then I click in secretly under my coat. We usually have 10-15 clickers and this allows for 7-9 min of free time for me and my fellow classmates to watch tic tick videos.","#12882

I was seating in the lecture behind the guy in a relatively close distant so I could see what’s happening on his screen. His laptop screen lighted up right in his mailbox and and there was a bold headline saying “The guideline on how to sell your soul to Satan”. I couldn’t read the rest since he quickly closed the tap being afraid that someone might catch him. But heeey I did! I totally understand that there’s so much educational pressure, midterm stress, life sucks, and maybe you visited UBC’s mental health service.

Thanks a lot. You're post created some copycat serial pissers now. There I am, 2 am trying to get some history essay done; window was open and a cool breeze was keeping me awake when all of a sudden: splat-splat-splat-splat!! All over my desk!!. At first I thought it was rain, so I shut my window and went to grab a paper towel to wipe it up. When I came back, it smelled. Really badly. IDK how tf I didn't manage to throw up, cleaned it up and went to the front desk, only to be told that they can only keep it in their records, since I had no proof. I mean, was I supposed to let the piss stay on my desk and bring you guys up to smell it???

In the light of Black History Month, I want to discuss the topic of race as a racial minority.
I have always wanted to be white.
My culture embraces whiteness so much. If you’re white, you’re considered beautiful. Even better if you have blond hair and blue eyes. I remember a relative saying that she’ll never marry her own race, saying she prefers someone with light skin. This white worship overwhelmed me so much and at a young age, I knew that I wanted to put whiteness on a pedestal.
For a long time, I wouldn’t embrace my culture. I wouldn’t embrace my foreign language. I wouldn’t embrace my looks. I wouldn’t embrace my heritage.
This desire to be white had become so toxic. I wanted attention from white people. I wanted white friends. All my crushes had been white. I wanted to be with a white person and have half-white kids. I would embrace things that a typical white person would embrace. Heck, I even wanted to go to a white-majority university like Queen’s (so many WASPs) but significant factors led me to stay at UBC. I just didn’t want to be seen as a foreigner. I wanted to be seen as one of the whites.
I don’t know how to battle this white worship and it has been a struggle. I know my life is sad but I really wanted to confess this because no one else knows. I know this topic is probably not something you want to hear but I really hope that it’s going to spark a continued discussion about race and what it means to be white or non-white in our society.","#12877

I just had the most fucked up experience at the UBC McDonald's. So me and my friend go to make a McDick's run around 9PM and we ordered a six piece of Chicken nuggets, among other things. As we were waiting, we saw the cook serving up our order and I shit you not, he SPAT into the box of our nuggets. He was then about to serve it up when his coworker saw what he did, pulled the box back and threw it out before they gave it to us. After that, he walked away into the back of the kitchen and blew his nose into his hands and started making food again without washing them (Mind you, no one at McDonald's wears gloves, especially him). We were so shocked that we told several employees and none of them seemed to care at all. We then got the rest of our order and were so disgusted that we asked for a refund and told the manager what happened but she didn't seem to care at all and just laughed it off. She asked if we wanted a 20 piece box of nuggets instead - after we just saw the cook spit into our last order. We also asked her 3 times if any employees ever wore gloves and each time we asked, she just shrugged her shoulders and smiled but NEVER gave a response. That whole thing was fucked up because we realized if we ordered from Uber Eats or some food delivery service, we wouldn't have even caught it and ended up eating some nasty ass chicken nuggs with spit sauce on top of them. Next time you order at the UBC McDonald's, just watch what the person making your food is doing or else you might end up with spit, leftover shit from their last bathroom break they didn't decide to wash their hands, or crusty-ass boogers to make your snackwrap extra crispy.","#12876

I tie my scarf in a certain way that when I'm wearing it, I can feel a slight tension around my neck choking me, but the scarf doesn't appear to be tied too tight. Furthermore, it's tied in way then when I take it off I'm being choked super hard for a few seconds to the point where I'm turned on. It brings a wave of memories back to my last ex when they would say ""Yes! Choke me Daddy"" as I start choking them while we're having sex.

- Sitting upright at desk
- Listening to classical music while sipping green tea
- Taking 10-minute exercise and healthy snack breaks
- Face mask: on
- Happy. Sense of purpose and hope. Motivated and driven to succeed
Grad school:
- Laying on couch under blanket. Jumbo beer in hand (it’s 10:30am).
- Rick and Morty playing in the background
- Defeatedly plugging numbers into excel
- eye bag city
- dreaming about dropping out and moving away to somewhere I can make a living without any education, maybe as a farm hand in belize, who knows??","#12866

I've finally arrived in Canada after leaving Hubei province (not Wuhan, but from a township that is not yet quarantined in the province thankfully). I decided to isolate myself for 2 weeks just out of respect for the UBC community, the Chinese community and Canada as a whole, which I'm very very thankful to be here as an international student (Thank you for accepting me with open and friendly arms, and to the CBSA officers that gave me information on what to do if I turn out to be infected). I'm actually feeling fine, maybe a mild cough but I think that's from smoking more often than usual.
After deciding not to go to lectures and work on the material on my own, I asked one of my profs for copies of her slides. Instead, she sends me back an email saying if I miss anymore classes, I will not be able to pass the course, tells me her slides are her own copyrighted materials, and that she expects me to come to class tomorrow. She criticized me for taking an unauthorized holiday right in the middle of the term and that it was a stupid idea to begin with. With my grandma almost at age 86 and in frail health, I felt like I didn't have an option but to visit her, but okay, criticize my life choices.
It is frustrating that UBC has no standardized policy on academic concessions for those of us returning from China and need to isolate ourselves to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. Anyways, I'm forced to attend that class because I can't afford to fail a course and push back my degree. So, thanks for nothing, Dr. idiot.","#12859

I have stayed silent about a certain person running for a particular position, but after seeing post #12838, I felt like I also have to share my experience with that same particular candidate. It was very difficult for me to see his election campaign and promotional posts, especially because some of my friends support him without knowing about the fact that he harasses girls on a regular basis. And now, with one day left in the election campaign, I feel like making this post would be my last chance of making a difference.
This particular candidate pretended to be a “good friend” while lying to me about his intentions and experiences. Throughout the course of my “friendship” with this candidate, this candidate sexually assaulted me while intoxicated, harassed me via messaging/texting multiple times despite my rejections to his advances, and ignored my requests to be left alone. Though I always tried to reject him politely, he mistook my kindness as a sign of me still wanting to interact with him. He never apologized or acknowledged for his actions, and the fact that people who know about his sexual assaults still support him saddens me. As a result, I never felt comfortable about sharing my experience with others. It doesn’t look like he has changed his behaviour, either, judging from the anon’s experience from post #12838. I don’t know what I would feel (as well as how the other girls he has sexually assaulted would feel) if he won his election, because we would no longer consider our school environment a safe place.

Probably the first real confession for UBC Confessions. Not your usual petty bantering and ranting.
I stole 14 boxes of surgical face masks from the hospital I volunteer at. I saw they were in a cupboard with no one around and stuffed them into my backpack, and came back for more. The hospital has hundreds, maybe thousands of boxes, so my theft barely puts a dent in the hospital's supplies. I just mailed them to China by private courier, assuming the depot staff didn't just steal them from me too.
I'm not proud of it but I feel so powerless to help my family and friends back in China. My dream is to become a doctor and help other people, but for now, this was the only way I could make a difference. One day, I'll pay the debt back.
I honestly don't regret it, but I still feel awful. I'm in my bed right now, contemplating whether it was the right decision and I can't make up my mind. I lied to my family and said I was able to buy them at the pharmacy at UBC, in my head I can't bear to tell them I stole the masks from the hospital. I'm terrified I'll get caught, and that I'll never get into medical school because of it, it's not like Canadians have much sense about these things, they don't know what a Chinese family is like. They'll cry about a few dollars worth of supplies going missing if it means feeling righteous.
If your family was at risk of dying, wouldn't you do the same thing? Canadians love to get high and mighty on their horse, but when your fellow citizens are actually dying by the hundreds/thousands, wouldn't you feel the same way?
You would do the same thing. That's how much of a crisis we're in.","#12854

Sauder has an elite finance program called the Portfolio Management Foundation (PMF) where a group of ~20 students from 2nd to 4th year manage $12 million by putting the money toward stocks and bonds. More importantly, the program sets you up with finance internships that you otherwise could not get because they have a really good network in Toronto and the US (job markets that are generally inaccessible to UBC students without knowing anyone at those companies). So, given all this, you can imagine it being really competitive to get into with ~100 people applying and 6-8 people getting in every year (only 2nd years can apply).
Recently, HALF of the senior students were fired because of “improper conduct and use of funds”. What pisses me off as someone who applied to the program and is still actively struggling to get a job in finance is that these students who abused their position will be fine. Because it's their last year of school, they already had internship experience with full time return offers lined up. Sure, they don’t get the certificate they’re supposed to get when they graduate as part of the program, but they reaped all the job-related benefits while breaking the ethical grounds they said they would uphold.
As a program that supposedly admits people on the sole basis of “fit” and “being a good person” (the hiring process has no skill-based component), this left a really bad taste in my mouth. After applying to 100+ finance jobs without any real luck, it hurts that people who basically have everything they need career-wise, still try to take advantage of their position in such ways.
To the people in charge of hiring, think more carefully about who you decide to let in. To the students still in the program, be grateful for the position you’re in and don’t push your moral boundaries.","#12849

This also applies to the ones that not only abstain from using soap and scrubbing but literally just run their hands over water for 5 seconds (I’ve even seen cases where they’re only dipping their fingers in the water or just with one hand) before using those same stank ass hands to open the door and touch who knows what across campus.
Y’all are disgusting.
And I just have to ask: what’s the point of wearing masks to “prevent” contraction of the coronavirus (which by the way are not effective tools at all) if you’re not even going to take the time to wash your goddamn hands properly while repeatedly touching/adjusting the mask throughout the day?!
If you’re feeling guilty while reading this confession- I advise you to practice better hygiene out of courtesy to fellow peers, faculty and staff around you.
In addition, if you’re sick, feeling sick, or recovering from a cold/fever- stop and think for yourself whether or not you should go to campus and risk exposing whatever you caught to others at the cost of you missing classes.

I can only speak from the experiences that I had today from within women’s washrooms of different buildings across campus but I’m sure this pertains to men’s washrooms as well.

Just comparing how beautifully organised the math courses are compared to all engineering courses is just sad.

Sitting in my stats class with a bunch of engineering students and I came up with my own probability problem that I think our prof should put on our quiz:
The class gender split is as follows: 35% female, 65% male. The population of females in engineering is 18%, and the class is 40% engineering students. If there are 86 students (myself included) registered in the course,
a) what is the probability that I sit next to at least 2 female engineering students after 9 classes, if seats were randomly assigned?
b) suppose that if I sit first, the probability of a female sitting next to me is 6%, yet if I am late to class, there is a 74% chance there is at least one empty seat next to a female classmate. Given I sat next to a female engineering student once in the past 10 lectures, what is the probability that my bus was late that day?","#12843

Getting into Sauder was cool, but I wish I considered the toxicity of the environment before I rejected Rotman and chose Sauder.
I'm a first year student, and the hardest thing about being a first year student without your close friend circle is making new friends and starting the cycle all over again. I want to be the genuine person I am, but I'm just thinking about lying about my faculty now. Why is it that you can hold such a nice conversation with someone, but the moment you tell them you're in Sauder, they look like they choked on a knife.
""But you're too nice to be in Sauder,"" were the words that came out of her mouth. I shrug it off thinking that people just view business students to be cunning.
""Sauder students are such snakes."" This is where things start going downhill. She starts staring at me with a disgusted look on her face.
""You guys are such ssssssssssssnakes,"" fuck– that was the last thing I wanted to be associated with.
""I'm poor, why don't you lend me some money because you all walk around in such fancy suits?"" Well first of all, I'm poor as fuck too. Second, my suit is from H&M thanks.
And to the CUS, you're not helping at all. With your terrible track record, we're forever going to stay as snakes. Re-brand yourself before Sauder's acceptance rate becomes 100% because people are going to pick somewhere else.
I chose the wrong school. Thick skin is needed in this industry, but a first-year trying to find their way doesn't need to be beat down in order to tread on water. I'm just going to lie and say I'm in International Economics.","#12842

TW: sexual violence
Seeing the election post about a particular candidate, sometimes we have to protect ourselves and be wise for who you should trust. His ad is just really bothering me lately because I seriously don't want to see his face ever.
There's one candidate who was trying to take advantage of me last year. I thought he was a friend until he almost rapes me.
Report him to the Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office (SVPRO) and some other offices, but didn't start the investigation for some personal reasons.
But just to remind you, SVPRO still kept the documents and I also went to do some examination afterwards. I really hope that you learn how to respect women after that incident.
A NO is a NO, even when a girl is intoxicated.
Like honestly, boys if you don't want to ruin your bright future, think twice. No matter how drunk your friend is, it doesn't mean she wants to hook up with you.","#12838

To Ella Meyer, the author of the Ubessey article ""Which Buses Are Best To Cry On?"":
1) It sounds like you cry a lot; I hope it's because you're good at knowing when you need to release emotional stress and not because you're sad a lot. If it's the latter, I suggest chocolate and hugs.
2) You're hilarious
3) Did you know your article made it to the NUMTOTs Facebook page?
3) You forgot to mention that the best place for public-transit crying isn't on a bus. It's on the sun-deck of any large BC Ferry. If you haven't cried there, I suggest it. Depart Schwartz Bay for Tsawassen just before/around sunset: an astounding view, the ocean, the colourful sky, and, (since everyone leaves the deck at dusk for some reason), privacy to wail into the oceanic abyss. As you approach Vancouver you'll get to see buildings lit up against the night sky - nostalgia in a redemptive sort of way.

I told this story to a couple of my friends but honestly I think everyone at UBC should know. The washroom in the Student Life Building are completely disgusting. One time I walked in, did my business, and washed my hand. Afterwards I dried my hands and I was about to toss the used paper towel into the garbage bin when I saw what looked like fruit flies scattered all over the bin. I thought maybe someone had left a banana in the bin and fruit flies had multiplied over the course of the day. But when I threw the paper towel in NONE of the flies flew away which I found strange. So I decided to investigate and moved closer to the bin. This is when I realized that the tiny flecks on the bin weren't fruit flies but lice. About a hundred lice scattered were scattered all over the bin. Thankfully a custodian was around to empty it, but that ladies and gentleman is why I'll never use the Student Life Building washroom ever again.","#12836

Stay tuned for the most unfortunate story during exam son when I forgot a notebook while studying late at night...
Ok so I find one of those ghetto ass vending machines that gives out notebooks. So I go up there and I realize it only takes loonies, toonies, and quarters, so I go beg my friends for all their change and I go back and put my money in. It only takes exact change. So then I have to sit there and fucking figure out with the other vending machines how I can break all my toonies by buying candy and getting quarters back. so I am doing all this math and I realize it just can’t be done. I will get the right amount of change back but then I will be short overall for the 3.25 notebook. So I decide to go upstairs and ask the front desk to break my change. great. Come back downstairs and put the money in but now the machine has decided to start at a fucking .05 cent credit. So no matter what I can’t get to the price 3.25 because It doesn’t accept 10 cents or 5 cents so it kept just going to 3.30. at this point im really annoyed. So I climb behind the machine and hit the reset button and unplug it. success. It restarts and the 5 cent credit is gone. Then I put my change in, finally successfully hit that E5 button. And it starts dispensing the fucking one beside it. E4. Im hitting E5 over and over again and it just keeps circling E4. Moral of the story I did not get my shitty Ubc notebook.","#12830

UBC is trying to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly which is great and I 100% support! But, I don’t think all of their staff are being very caring towards this because in my case they went through the motions but put no thought in. I went to pier2 the other day and I saw a little sign that said bringing your own plate was 25cents off which got me thinking oh yeah, I really just need something for them to place my pizza in, I don’t need them to give me single use (although paper) plates! I don’t go often to pier2 so I was unsure of their system that they place the pizza into an oven for a short period of time before serving it to you.

SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH FOOD AND SHOULD KNOW AT LEAST BASIC FOOD SAFE WOULD PUT MY PLASTIC CONTAINER INTO A OVEN.

UBC is trying to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly which is great and I 100% support! But, I don’t think all of their staff are being very caring towards this because in my case they went through the motions but put no thought in. I went to pier2 the other day and I saw a little sign that said bringing your own plate was 25cents off which got me thinking oh yeah, I really just need something for them to place my pizza in, I don’t need them to give me single use (although paper) plates! I don’t go often to pier2 so I was unsure of their system that they place the pizza into an oven for a short period of time before serving it to you.

I don't think UBC students are are overly-entitled when it comes to complaining about transit, but I think you need to have a bit more insight on this issue. Metro Vancouver voters (mostly the older population) voted against extra funding for transit expansion in the plebiscite five years ago. They knew they would be screwing up the future of the next generation, but they were too cheap for a 0.5% sales tax. The previous provincial government has been cutting transit funding for over a decade. Many municipal governments have been reducing their investments in infrastructure and maintenance ever since the 2008 recession, hence the pathetic snow removal. Due to these decisions from the past, we are feeling the crunch as TransLink is playing the catch up game in a world of constant worsening traffic.
I agree that the service can be be better, but you as members of the community have to keep our elected officials accountable. They are the ones that set the mandate for TransLink. Plus, we need more representation to balance out the whining and bitching from the boomers.
As for the CEO's 25% raise, I think it's a bit high, but my PERSONAL commute has greatly improved since he became CEO. The compass cards make getting my upasses so much easier. The Evergreen Extension shaves an hour off my daily commute. I even took transit to my 4am shifts, to class at UBC and to my co-op out in Langley. Our transit system still has areas of growth, but it is slowly improving. However, you need to ensure your politicians (mainly the municipal and provincial ones) are making policies and decisions that support public transit.","#12827

After working at a bank as a teller/Customer Service Representative, here are some experiences I would like to share. Banking is pretty much on your phone/online now, even if you have to do transactions, you have an ATM that can pretty much do anything if you don't like phones or w.e. Loans, mortgages, GICs, investments, anything, you can do online, get pre-approved, and all you really need to do is go to the bank to set-up accounts or sign a few documents. I'm pretty sure in the future this will all change too, or perhaps is already happening.
There are a lot of customers who are assholes, and pretty much 90% of them are. They are entitled, rude, ignorant, arrogant, and quite frequently show symptoms of the Dunning Kruger Effect.
Here are some common questions that arise (consider this a rant):
Q:""The only reason you put holds on my cheques is because you are making interest off of them""
A: As far as I'm concerned, you just gave me a piece of paper with some writing on it, I'm going to wait until the cheque is cleared (a.k.a. whoever gave it to you actually had their money taken out of their account and transferred to you), before I release any funds to you.
Q:""Why can't you just tell me if so-and-so has an account here?""
A: I don't know, can you tell me the names of the people that live at your house, and I'll just write it down in my phone real quick, no reason, just asking?
Q:""Banks should be free, why am I paying so many service charges?""
A: You ever try working for free? Doesn't this building cost money, these people who work here have to be paid, the memory, electricity, and hardware/software required to keep your information accurate and immediate not cost money?
Q:""Why can't I have a loan/credit card/chequing account?""
A: Not my fault your credit score is 2 digits, and you basically steal money from banks at this point.
Q:""Why can't I cash a cheque, it's my money?""
A: If I gave you a piece of paper, would you give me money for it? (Payday, Cash Money, Money Mart etc. actually provide these high risk services, so you're at the wrong place).
Q:""This other bank told me I could do this, why can't I do it here?""
A: Maybe because we're different companies?
Q:""I don't have to show you ID.""
A: Sure, next in line please.
Q:""I don't have to tell you where I got $20,000.00 cash from, just put it in my account.""
A: Sure thing, I'll just write up a financial crime report after all this, and likewise, I don't have to tell you why your accounts have been frozen, and the CRA/police are trying to contact you now.
Q:""The questions you are asking are very invasive.""
A: Don't get a bank account then, you're not forced to tell me. I ask because I record all this down in my phone, and sell this information to hackers, not because I need to keep your money safe, and protect your account from possible fraud.
Q:""I don't trust you.""
A: Neither do I. And guess what, at least I have a corporation that you can sue if whatever I did was unlawful/fraudulent. You have nothing.
Bizarre Claims Include:
Q:I think your internal system is getting hacked.
A:I wonder why we're still in business. The IT people went to school and trained in software engineering for years, and we spend millions on external audits. BUT, you have caught something that all of us were obviously way too incompetent to detect, good for you!
Q:I didn't do these transactions, why are you guys stealing from me?
A:Yup, I took your information and started going to every liquor store possible, casino, and payday advance. I have mastered the skills to rob you undetected, and I choose to rob an account that never exceeds the balance of $500.00.
Q:I saw you put that money in your own pocket.
A:Damn, you got me! Not only do we not do end of day balancing, but we also weigh a fast $20 dollars over the rest of my years credibility, reputation, and career. Takes one to know one.
Q:Don't photo copy my cheque, it's not for you.
A:I was hoping you wouldn't catch me, because I wanted to deposit this in my own account later- a black and white copy of a cheque with watermarks indicating non-negotiability. Also I was going to change my name to yours so the tellers wouldn't notice. Not because I need records to show for my work when audits happen.
Q:Just give me the cash first.
A:Nope.
Q:Why do you need to charge me interest?
A:Why do you demand we give you interest on your savings accounts then? Btw, if you can introduce me to whoever gives you money free of charge, I'd like to know them as well, and it's surprising how that person hasn't driven us all out of business yet.
Q:The whole banking system is just a Ponzi scheme.
A:Yes. The money we make from mortgages and interest payments, all fake. In fact, the government that loans us money at the end of the day to cover our differences/vice versa if any just gives us free money. Did you know that the government/Canada is in on it too?
Q:How can you justify making profit from us, you don't do anything!
A:You're right, banks are overrated. I keep all my money underneath my mattress at home. I lend money to strangers that pay me interest, and borrow money from strangers and agree to pay them back. But here's a little secret, don't tell anyone, I actually don't pay them back LOL! Who's gonna stop me eh?

To relive ourselves from our workloads, two of us decided to build a smol snowman, across from Buchanan A.
We rolled up and rounded out two snowballs, stacked them, and picked out branches for arms and tiny, angry eyebrows. We made sure to shelter him from most of the sunlight throughout the day so he wouldn’t melt so easily. We named him Mochi.
I checked on him every now and then, before I started classes and before I left school. Mochi lived out his first day in peace.
Tonight, as usual, I decided to check up on him again. This time, I found his head shattered into 3 pieces, the largest piece several feet away from his lifeless body. It was clear a murder had taken place.
Albeit short, Mochi’s life was one of joy... until right before his sudden end. To the friendly and very lovely people who Mochi had the misfortune to meet with his last breath, may your frosty exams terror-ice you forever. 🙂","#12824

For those that assume engineers are smart, let me tell you a thing. I once dated an engineer from UBC. We lived together and paid $900 total for a two bedroom suite in Vancouver. He had a conversation with our landlord one day in passing, and somehow ACCIDENTALLY gave him the impression that we were moving out at the end of the month. We had maybe one conversation together about eventually moving closer to UBC, but were not actively looking at places or planning to move out. I didn’t find out until the end of the month, when our landlord asked what day we’d be leaving. We had a couple of days to find a new place and ended up having to live in Delta and commute 1.5 hours to school one way.","#12815

I experienced sexual misconduct from someone attending UBC over a week ago.
SASC:
THANK YOU for being more supportive, responsive, and effective than the police and SVPRO combined. students are the real MVP.
while I'm here and venting, just a few things to add-
SVPRO:
why does my report (contact info included) get sent to my assailant if it goes to investigation? I am not comforted by ""Policy 131 Section 1.9: UBC will not tolerate retaliation against anyone involved in a disclosure."" your protections for this are a) health & safety options, and b) 911... really??
also, thanks for that automated email response - your two support options (medical or report) are useless to me, and your referral to campus security refers me back to you.
VPD:
...you can't take action ""yet?"" wow. the word ""yet"" has never been scarier to me. I'm curious, what WOULD it take?
PS - really, really want to know if this guy is a repeat offender. so, if someone in PoliSci with a very strange youtube channel (searchable under his name) has stalked you, sexually harassed you, or anything worse, please feel free to speak up in the comments. I can DM you and, with your permission, add your experience to my report - of course anonymous if you'd like.
totally understand if you choose to stay quiet- I probably wouldn't even submit this if SVPRO wasn't about to send my report to him anyways. hopefully you can at least get a bit of comfort knowing there's a report and a (possible) investigation underway.

So as a UBC student and someone who prides herself on caring for the environment I decided to buy an electric car last year. Plus I thought it would save me a bunch of money on paying for gas. Instead of making charging stations free and encouraging more people to buy electric cars, UBC has now decided to charge vehicles for charging their cars in the parkades. This is so unfair. Im already paying 1200 dollars for a parking pass for 8 months and now you want to charge me extra for charging my car? Seriously?? This is ridiculous and unfair.","#12810

The elevator in (my residence building) is truly a gift that keeps giving. Every time it’s Chonky metal doors slide open, I am welcomed with a new... aroma. A fragrance. An assault on the olfactory senses. This glorious scent(s) is often accompanied by it’s very own complementary questionable stain/puddle on the elevator floor (of varying colours and textures, sometimes all at once). I know not the origins of this mélange of solids, liquids and gas.
Everyday, I stand by the elevator, trying to guess what is to come - I am always surprised - an overwhelming amount of Axe body spray, boiled potatoes, spoilt fish, armpits, chlorine, I could go on and on.

It was a snowy, cold, and windy day. My friends and I leisurely walked to our ECON class. As we settled down, Ratna was setting up the projector with his slides. There were weird pop-ups about Norton security but no one thought anything of it. I looked down at my phone for 2 seconds, and suddenly I heard a loud gasp followed by laughter in unison. I looked back up at the projector, and to say the least, there was an extremely explicit and let’s just say, NUDE, and inappropriate pop up. It was obviously a virus on the computer (or we hope so).
Yeah that was pretty embarrassing and awkward for Ratna but hopefully the tech people fixed it lol.","#12806

I'm opposed to the Arts Student Centre. Why? Because the AUS isn't even capable of maintaining its own tiny Buchanan lounge as it stands. It's consistently a mess.
For example, the microwaves. SUS cleans out its microwaves. The AUS has never cleaned out the one microwave they've had for nearly half a decade, and when pressed with student complaints to clean the microwave, they announced plans to buy another microwave instead of trying to clean out its current one.
AUS Execs act incredibly high and mighty when it comes to cleaning out a microwave. They all seem to have the impression they're too good for it, and that other Arts students who aren't execs should be responsible for regularly cleaning out the microwaves for the benefit of the community.
No, you took on that responsibility. Being an exec isn't just about going to council meetings and debating what meaningless bylaw about what proportion of the people running for elections can own a car. You also just as well took on the responsibility of maintaining and supporting the student space that all Arts students have on campus.
The AUS Buchanan Lounge is cluttered as fuck. It's filled with grungy old couches laid to the side of the space, and stupid giant letters. There's significant room for the layout to improve, the couches don't necessarily need to be aligned with the walls and you could add a pool table or something with the amount of wasted space we have.
If the AUS can't even bother to clean out the one microwave they own, they certainly aren't capable of operating a multi-million dollar student space. I mean as much as we give the SUS shit for how badly they treat the Abdul Ladha space, at least they've added worthwhile fixtures, clean their space, and clean the microwaves.","#12803

After class I like to change into gym gear before heading for a nice workout.
Normally I would use the change rooms or something by the ARC but on this particular day I had to pee pretty bad as well so right after class I flew to one of Buchanan’s glorious seemingly empty washrooms, quickly spotted a stall and took a piss while stripping my clothes.
At this point my bra, shirt, pink freaking dress is all strewn across the floor when from the stall next over I hear a male voice making grunting noises as this dude was taking a dump.
I froze.
“...why is there a guy in the girls washroom”
But I quickly let go of that thought because well, a washroom is a washroom maybe he just really had to go. Then next thing you know I hear more male voices.
This time I really froze.
Rooted to the spot.
Suddenly the extreme cleanliness of the stalls, voices barely above a whisper, no period silver boxes made sense to me.
I quickly peeked from below the stall to see male legs and began to panic.
I was stuck in the guys washroom.
My friends were so unhelpful they just made fun of me on text while I quickly picked up my clothes before someone saw.
I didn’t know when to leave because I really couldn’t tell what was happening so finally I thought enough was enough, after all a washroom is a washroom, so I stepped out with my gym gear and strode right out of the washroom. As I walked out I noticed the urinals that I missed before and as soon as I was out I ran as fast as I could before finding a sink to wash my hands.
That being said I wish the women’s washroom culture was more like the
Men’s. No going in packs, bloody tampons and blood marks everywhere, super loud voices.
I learned a new lesson today: I should just keep going to the men’s washroom.","#12797

At this point my bra, shirt, pink freaking dress is all strewn across the floor when from the stall next over I hear a male voice making grunting noises as this dude was taking a dump.
I froze.
“...why is there a guy in the girls washroom”
But I quickly let go of that thought because well, a washroom is a washroom maybe he just really had to go. Then next thing you know I hear more male voices.
This time I really froze.
Rooted to the spot.
Suddenly the extreme cleanliness of the stalls, voices barely above a whisper, no period silver boxes made sense to me.
I quickly peeked from below the stall to see male legs and began to panic.
I was stuck in the guys washroom.
My friends were so unhelpful they just made fun of me on text while I quickly picked up my clothes before someone saw.
I didn’t know when to leave because I really couldn’t tell what was happening so finally I thought enough was enough, after all a washroom is a washroom, so I stepped out with my gym gear and strode right out of the washroom. As I walked out I noticed the urinals that I missed before and as soon as I was out I ran as fast as I could before finding a sink to wash my hands.
That being said I wish the women’s washroom culture was more like the
Men’s. No going in packs, bloody tampons and blood marks everywhere, super loud voices.
I learned a new lesson today: I should just keep going to the men’s washroom.",,1579304833,,,139,14,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2947082428643364&id=1287650764586547,

Expected the transit delays would be reduced after the strike but buses are still a shitshow. Honestly disappointing that in a city as nice as Vancouver, the publiv transit does not understand the concept of punctuality. To those that defend this by saying: ""you should be grateful for what we have""/""there are so many countries that have it worse"" just stop. Being satisfied with what we have by comparing it to those that have it worse is
just being content with mediocrity, and it's a way to justify a shitty system that needs significant improvement. I shouldnt have to leave my house 10 minutes earlier just in case the bus decides to come early and leave. There are many examples of countries where transit is actually on time, Germany, Austria, Japan, Korea being prime examples. If a bus is supposed to arrive at a certain time, the driver should arrive within a minute or two of the anticipated time, not whatever time they please. This is not on the bus drivers, rather Translink's incompetence. With the CEO Kevin Desmond giving himself a 25% raise, I think it's a fair argument to say that the public expects more efficiency, and an improved transit system. Shame on Translink executives who have no idea how to run a punctual transit system.","#12795

I hope you guys are happy about the new RapidBuses. I got to try one too!
It all started because Translink decide to cancel the 480 outside of rush hours. But the jet-lagged me waking up at 11 in the morning needed to get to the first day of class on time somehow. So the ""smart"" me had an idea: why don't I ride the Skytrain and try the R4 line?
I never stopped at the Oakridge station before, but for some reason today I thought it was a good time to try. Luckily, I was able to get onto the R4 as it was about to leave. As I went in and out of a half-asleep state, the rain covering much of the scenery outside, I felt that I didn't recognize the bus stops at all. I thought it was fine, this is a new route after all.
Until Google Maps told my dumbass I was in Burnaby.
By the time I realized my fuck up, the bus was already at the unloading site. Scarred from my last experience, I was forced to board the R4, this time actually bound to UBC. I arrived on campus half an hour late, hungry, and in a much more miserable state than intended.
The worst part was I had to take the R4 two more times leaving campus.
So dear Translink, please re-instate the 480 outside of rush hours. Please do it in consideration of those who have no sense of direction and are naturally slow-witted.
Sincerely,
[redacted]","#12793

Now imagine this: I'm just coming back from the holidays and already in a pretty shitty mood because classes start tomorrow. I also come back to a room I still need to clean. The laundry is piling up and I need to do that as well. So I go and quickly put in my load and resume unpacking. Now, here's where it gets fucking horrible. I go open the washer door to transfer my clothes to the dryer and lo and behold, THERE'S A FUCKING USED CONDOM STUCK TO THE THE RIM OF THE WASHING MACHINE! I CAN SEE THE FUCKING CUM IN IT!

For those looking for a wholesome confession:
To the Indian girl in the red sweater who comforted me and gave me a hug in Irving’s Music Arts and Architecture library washroom on December 15th at around 4pm: thank you so much for your kindness. I don’t know if I made eye contact with you while entering the stall or if I was too loud even though I tried to cry silently, but you somehow figured out what was going on. You came out of your stall, washed your hands and waited around until I finally came out. You asked me multiple times if I was okay, if I wanted to talk about it, if I needed anything, etc. even though I kept declining your help. Then, when you were about to leave, you came back and asked me if I wanted a hug.
You have no idea how much that hug meant to me and how much I needed it. Thank you. The past few weeks had been very emotionally draining/painful due to finals, relationship problems and my severe depression. That day, I was skyping my ex in one of the MAA study rooms and was crying since he dropped some very unpleasant and unexpected news on me (knowingly less than 2 days before my hard bio final, shoutout to him!!!). I had to go to the washroom during the skype call so I tried my best to not look visibly upset, which evidently didn’t work.
I didn’t think anyone would pay attention anyway since I’ve often cried at the 4th floor tables this term and no one had ever approached me before. But you did. You spent your valuable studying time and energy on me, a complete stranger. You were so patient when you tried to comfort me several times. Even as you were leaving, you STILL came back and tried one last time. And I’m very glad, because I love hugs. That hug was so so comforting and made me feel better. I was also blown away by your empathy and you reminded my cynical self that people can still be kind to each other during stressful times. I was really hurting because of my ex, worried about studying for my final in my mental state and I’m so grateful that you were there when I really needed it. Thank you.
I hope your finals and holidays went well, you seriously deserve some good karma. And if possible, I’d like to treat you to some coffee or ice cream and express my gratitude in person so PLEASE comment below and I’ll message you!!

i can’t quite put my finger on it but it’s a little odd that UBC’s Free Speech clubs keep inviting speakers who write for neo-Nazi sites that have praised Hitler, talk about ""superior"" white genes and inferior black/brown IQ, repeat the rhetoric of mass killers who have shot up mosques and synagogues, and keep pushing the conspiracy theory that Jews are letting in immigrants to Canada to replace white people 🤔🤔
not concerning at all that their latest speaker has called Africans “barbaric”, non-white countries “shitholes”, is against race-mixing and interracial relationships, and has said that Richmond is becoming like Asian cities which are all “inhabited by hordes of people releasing waste and spitting in every direction”. His blog is still very active on the alt-right social media platform used by the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter and he has written for multiple neo-Nazi sites that have published articles such as ""Hitler Made Us Holy Again"", and ""Racial Differences Are Real: Whites have Greater Lung Capacity than Negroes"". I'm sure it's just a coincidence! 🧐🧐
also totally normal that at one of their events inside a UBC classroom, the idea of going back to racially segregated communities was openly discussed without any disagreement from the speakers, audience, or club moderators 🤨🤨 i'm sure it was just an honest mistake on everyone's part though! there's no way anything bad will occur if this trend continues!","#12781

I was taking POLI 110 with Justin Alger, who with his heart of gold, never said no to any requests from a voluntourism agency to talk about volunteering abroad. He was a fantastic instructor, but unwittingly enabled us to go into unsafe, and stupid situations abroad.
We fund raised and poured much of our limited personal funds to go on a stupid voluntourism trip abroad. I won't name the specific country since I don't want people to shame a country that quite honestly didn't do anything wrong (and treated us with respect throughout the process).
By the time we got there, it became quite apparent that the only support we got within that country getting around was a sketchy dude with a minivan, who wanted to extract more cash out of us. He made us pay for all of his incidentals, and went slightly overboard with it. Adding to it, the Himalayas and the general remoteness of the place we were going to within the country meant that we were stranded if something went wrong, and we would have a ton of trouble reaching the agency for support, let alone the Canadian embassy. In fact, we were told that the embassy in the country had limited ability to provide assistance, and frequently relied on the High Commission in New Delhi to deliver emergency services. So the first thing that went wrong was hiring sketch people as guides and taking us into the bumfuck middle of nowhere.
We honestly didn't do any meaningful volunteering. Much of our volunteering actually put unskilled labourers out of work, and quite frankly we were shit at it. We didn't make much of a difference, Voluntourism is basically that, it's the guise of tourism under the idea of doing good, when in practice, we weren't. We played around with the local kids but in reality, our positive experience was limited to our community interactions. We did more harm than we ever did good.
On our way out of the country, we were stopped. One of the group members admitted we were volunteering, and they immediately detained all of us at the airport. It turned out that the voluntourism's agency's advice to get a tourist visa on arrival was actually incredibly illegal. We weren't the first ones they've seen pulling that crap, so we pleaded our right to consular assistance, from Canada, and 1 from Australia.
Lo and behold, a Canadian consular officer shows up, takes us into a room, and fucking shouts at us for being dumbasses, and told us that we were going to apologize, get on our knees, admit our mistake and promise never to pull that off again, in a show of pure humility and stupidity. We were going to beg. The border officers laughed, shook hands with the consular officer, took a 30th copy of our passports and visas, took a photo of us together (and some bunny ear photos just for shits and giggles - guess it was a slow day), let us go, but banned us from re-entry for 7 years. On the way out, we thanked the consular officer, probably thinking he's pulled out dumb young foreigners out of sticky situations by humiliating them before, and we got the fuck outta that country. The Australian consular officer never showed up in time, so bless Canada?
Never fucking do unskilled voluntourism.

I have a severe pet peeve with comments on UBC Confessions & r/UBC trying to justify rude, unfair or anti-social behaviour from international students.
Every time I see a post involving ""International students cheat"" or ""International student sneezed on me"", I always see a dozen or so people showing up to try and explain this behaviour, or at worst, justify it. Things like ""Oh, it's normal in Chinese, Icelandic, French, American, etc. culture to do ____, so they probably don't even realize what they're doing is ___"".
Are you serious? We don't need an explanation. We're venting that some asshole sneezed on us and didn't even apologize, or cheated on an exam. We're not looking for a justification, an explanation, wtv. We're asking people to not sneeze on us.

When he makes you dinner its a whole new level of thoughtfulness. It takes serious confidence, time and consideration to prepare a dinner at his place for me to eat upon entry. He tidied up the place despite roommate messes. He didn't want me to help because it was supposed to be my night to relax.

Now don't get me wrong, everyone has bad days, but you shouldn't be belittling students or telling them they can't succeed in their classes just because they don't understand ""easy"" concepts.

I’ve noticed that occasionally there are confessions complaining about UBC’s advising or some form of administration / support, so I want to share my experience too.
I failed out of UBC Science years ago but through really hard work, was readmitted to UBC engineering and recently graduated. When I failed out, I met with general advisors and science advisors to try to make a plan on what to do to get back in to UBC. I obviously knew that I would need to make drastic changes to how I learn and prepare for exams. I went in to those meetings hopeful to hash out a plan to attend a smaller local college for a year and then reapply to UBC. The reception I got, however, was incredibly discouraging to me.
I will never forget the advice I received, word for word: “Looking at your grades since you started school, it might be pretty clear that you’re not cut out for academics. But that’s okay! You know, there are a lot of options out there for people like you. Would you like me to email you some sources to research the trades offered at some B.C. colleges?”
Honestly, I don’t know if this is normal, or if others would find this normal. I don’t think it’s appropriate to tell someone they’re essentially too dumb for science education.
I walked out of that meeting extremely shaken. I cried on the commute home and broke down infront of my mom. It was my family’s advice that helped me out, not UBC advising. My family pointed out how strong all my science grades were before, and that I could do it again with tweaks to my studying and learning. It was my family that pointed me to other really successful people in science and engineering that could offer me pointers and tips. Soon after, I enrolled at Langara, did the engineering transfer program, and got into UBC mechanical engineering a year later. The point I want to make is that it seems “advisors” are only ever good for the most general of advising. I honestly think they should just be axed out of their jobs and the money spent on their salaries put towards other things. It seems as though students have to figure out everything for themselves entirely anyway, so what’s the use of these people soaking up the university’s money to marginally help people. Or in my case, not help at all.
Take the advice of “advisors” with a grain of salt. These people don’t seem to know what they’re doing and all too often seem to brush off students with failures in courses as lost causes. We’re not lost causes, sometimes we need a push in the right direction.","#12773

This is my last night at UBC so I just had to write this.
Thanks for all the lovely memories I made here. Vancouver was super rainy, often cold, and being on exchange is quite hard sometimes, so not every single day was happy. But that didn't stop me from meeting great people. During the past four month, I met people who literally changed a part of my life, the way I think about myself, and the way I judged my past. I did not meet the love of my life (didn't even get a single date), neither did I get 50 Facebook friends, but there are little traces that will remain inside me, for a long long time.
The midnight conversations that I had with my favorite roommate (hopefully we were not intruding the other roommates), the way my friend cheered me up when I was feeling down. Being able to converse with people freely about my political opinions, my identity as a racial minority, and as a LGBT person. Being at the pride without worrying about hatred and violence. Speaking about the scars of my past and my mental health without being afraid of being judged. Having lived in a quite conservative and extremely homogenous society, I cannot say how much I valued this time.
I felt very safe, welcomed, and respected during my time here. Thanks to everyone who I have met here, like the people who opened the door for me at some point, or just people who smiled at me, although we don't know each other.
Last but not least, I want to thank Ben. Your classes were one of the most inspiring and humorous courses that I ever had, and they just helped me a lot. I understand myself, my family and my friends much better now. Also, you were the warmest and most caring professor I ever had. Just knowing that there is somebody who you can ask for help, when you feel very depressed, overwhelmed, or sad, was a precious experience. I will miss cultural psychology. Wish you would be on a Ted Talk or Youtube channel some day, just that I can get another little lecture with you :)
So thanks, UBC. I will miss you.","[Admin note: this was submitted on December 18]

Being able to converse with people freely about my political opinions, my identity as a racial minority, and as a LGBT person. Being at the pride without worrying about hatred and violence. Speaking about the scars of my past and my mental health without being afraid of being judged. Having lived in a quite conservative and extremely homogenous society, I cannot say how much I valued this time.
I felt very safe, welcomed, and respected during my time here. Thanks to everyone who I have met here, like the people who opened the door for me at some point, or just people who smiled at me, although we don't know each other.
Last but not least, I want to thank Ben. Your classes were one of the most inspiring and humorous courses that I ever had, and they just helped me a lot. I understand myself, my family and my friends much better now. Also, you were the warmest and most caring professor I ever had. Just knowing that there is somebody who you can ask for help, when you feel very depressed, overwhelmed, or sad, was a precious experience. I will miss cultural psychology. Wish you would be on a Ted Talk or Youtube channel some day, just that I can get another little lecture with you :)
So thanks, UBC. I will miss you.",,1578330480,,,295,13,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2919452318073042&id=1287650764586547,

A PSA for everyone out there waiting on UBC Counselling appointments: the AMS health plan covers psychology visits! At any clinic! As long as you're talking to a qualified person. And if you go though the student care network, you can get almost all the costs covered.
I literally got an appointment in 48 hours.
Please take care of yourselves. You deserve better.
Also, take your vitamin D! You can buy them in gummy candy form and I was blown away at how much it helped my mood.","#12764

APPLES > oranges
Because you've ever heard of orange pie? No... What about caramelized oranges? Noooo. I don't understand you Orange enthusiasts. Like wtf is orange chocolate or orange flavoured chocolate? You a masochist or something?
Orange chicken? WHY?
Apples are the fruit of the gods. You can add it to your food as a natural sweetener with no weird hints of sour. Making a Japanese curry? Add apples. Making Maangchi's dakbokkeumtang? Apples. Life is already quite a few nodes sour and apples make it sweeter.

You people better secure your data!
Arts ISIT provides students with the ability to create eportfolios – which I think is pretty nice of them. Students are provided with a [studentname].ubcarts.ca address and can modify their site (to a certain extent) using a skimmed down version of WordPress.
I really wanted to customize the heck out of my website. However, Arts ISIT has a lot of the conventional WordPress features locked. So I decided to poke around at the URL to try to access pages I do think they wanted me to access.
Interestingly, the wp-content directory is freely accessible, and I can see all the stuff I posted – and all the stuff EVERYONE ELSE has posted!
https://anystudent.ubcarts.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/
After browsing through peoples stuff (some of you all have some nice projects ngl), two things come to mind. Firstly, why can I do this? I don’t think I should have access to everyone’s directory. Maybe Arts ISIT can fix this? I don’t know – I am not a professional in CMS.
Second thing is why do you all post your student numbers on work you share publicly? I can use your student number with your nice headshot that you uploaded onto the website and maybe get myself a UBCcard under your name if I am lucky.
I am posting this as a warning – cause I know it makes people uncomfortable that I (or anyone) can snoop around their data. Secure your data!","#12760

Hey all,
I'm one of the 900 exchange students and I'll leave UBC after term 1 in the next week. After I've read all the negative comments in this channel about so many things that happen at this university I want to share a few positive things with you:
THANK YOU for...
- welcoming exchange students on campus. I had only positive experiences when I met new people at UBC. I never felt that I was treated differently than regular UBC students. That's a big achievement!
- making it so easy for us to find things to do at UBC and in or around Vancouver. It would be a lie if I said that I never was bored during my time here but I had definitely more to do than in my home town. This is also thanks to the great work of the UBC Exchange Student Club!
- pretending that you didn't hear that I'm not a native speaker :)
- new experiences and new friends
...everything. It was great!
Thanks UBC! Tuum est.","#12759

He's really well cleaned-up and quicklu introduces himself as ""I'm blahblahblah, a student at BC and a prospectice somethin blahblah"". He reaches out for a handshake and I robotically accept because it's 9am. I shake his hand and felt something wet, and it was cum. WTF. This piece of shit came on his hand and got off on strangers touching it. He 180ed and ran into the skytrain station while I stood there shocked and cum-handed. It was so gross my god.

Lots of the confessions here are more towards the pessimistic side of things but I have something happy to write about.
I have friends now.
Four to be exact.
I didn't before, I mean there were days I'd commute to school, attend my classes and commute back and I hadn't spoken at all to anyone.
But now I actually have people to talk to, people that want to talk to me.
And it feels so nice to walk back from my exams not silent and lonely but with my friends congratulating me for finishing up or telling me that thought they're not there, they're excited to see me.
Or give big bear hugs while making fun of each other and being sarcastic.
It feels nice to be able to show my personality and know that people appreciate it.
It feels nice to stay up at night and discuss theories and myths and cool weird things that isn't just ""which faculty are you in?"" *all conversations halt when I say I'm in arts* -_-
It's just that...you may be having a hard time but when you surround yourself with good company, people that you genuinely like that like you too, you will actually feel alive for once.
So yes, I'm actually enjoying school.","#12750

Next, came the hyperventilation. Have you ever wanted to feel high without drugs? That’s how you do it. Lastly, to put it all together, because things were getting a bit wet at this point, I was wiping it all away with my hand. Guess what?

And y'all know how much of a grind it is, but today i can proudly say that I sit atop hundreds of connections. However recently something came to my attention: do y'all consider having a LinkedIn connection being friends? This is because there's this girl who i find mighty fine and as any normal human being i asked to follow her on instagram. She rejected my follow request ( D: ) but then went on to ask me to join her f****** network like b WHAT?
Anyway yeah, just wanted you guys' opinion and by the way, to my bros, do y'all think i should go in? and if so best believe ima do it on linkedin itself, ima start that a conversation with my new connection.","#12739

After using grindr for a couple months I'd say that I can’t count the number of dick pics, sexual and sugar daddy propositions from older men. At first I was really uncomfortable getting these messages but recently I’ve found this behaviour fascinating. I want to know what's going on in these guys heads, so I decided to do a little field research for myself.
It started when I responded to an older mans faceless profile. Long story short, he claims to be a UBC prof in my faculty and we deduce without revealing his identity that he hasn’t taught me. We talk a bit more and he asks me to lunch. Now I see this going one of two ways, either he’s cute enough and I just fucked a prof, or he’s a total creep and I got a free lunch. I decided I'd rather not miss out on fucking a hot prof and agree.
We meet up and let's just say he didn’t look like prince charming, but he did turn out to be a prof in my faculty. He starts lunch by asked how my grades are, not a question I expected from a grindr lunch date. I decide what the heck, I tell him how schools going and he responds by telling me I needed to get straight A’s for the rest of my degree if I wanted a good job. Already he isn’t the most charming guy out there, but I’m here for data so we move on. The conversation takes a turn to him repeatedly asking me about my ex. Explicit questions you don’t ask someone you just met. I quickly change the subject, he asks me what my hobbies are. I mention I’ve been really into swimming recently, he cuts me off and asks me if I've ever “had fun” in a pool locker room. I was not surprised at this question, if you mention this to anyone on grindr, they will ask this without fail. I say no and he proceeds to look me up and down and say i have a “swimmers body”. I continue to change the subject as to try and figure out what is going on in this guys mind. We had a conversation about his life and honestly it sounded pretty sad. TLDR: He has no family and works all the time. I'd feel bad for him if he wasn't so arrogant. We finish lunch and I’ve now gathered a lot of data, but I still didn’t know what his name is. I mention I've got a class soon and he says he's going to his lab. This is my chance. I tell him I’d like to see it (I’ll be safe as there are plenty of people around, he’s not gonna touch me). He agrees, smirks and says “wait till you see my office”. Ugh jesus gross, I laugh it off. We go to his lab, I see his name next to the door and am ready to get out of there.
I make the mistake of taking the elevator down with him. I quickly retreat to the corner but he either couldn’t read my body language or completely ignored it. He comes over, strokes my face and says I’m “adorable”, looking me up and down again. I felt so gross but honestly wasn't surprised. I leave the building, block him and go on with my day.
Lots of profs at UBC are great, some are creeps. Such is life.","#12737

More creepy men on busses stories! My friend (and roommate) and I went shopping downtown and took the 14 bus back to UBC where we reside. Exhausted from a day of activity, we sat next to each other at the front since the back was relatively full. We were both earbuds in individually listening to music when a shaggy older man seated perpendicular from me began to talk to me. He asked if I’m going to school at UBC and what I’m studying. I reluctantly told him. People make conversation on busses all the time. He then proceeded to ask for my name, which I then stupidly gave him :’) Instinct, I suppose. Anyway I quickly killed the conversation and put my earbuds back in. He kept talking to me so I half heartedly reacted to what he said. He was telling me that he came from a sketchier part of town where “if you’re not assertive enough people will take advantage of you” ????? He also said he used to do the pharmacy program at UBC (sure ok) in two years (false). He said his plans ended early and he might see me around later on campus. I told him I’m going home with my roommate and ended it there. At this point I was highly uncomfortable so I told my friend I’m going to sit at the back of the bus as I saw a few seats open. Two were next to each other, and a third empty seat was in a group of college boys. I decided to sit with the boys. The man then followed me to the back of the bus and sat in one of the two empty seats left. People around started to notice. My friend also followed him to make sure I was okay. I was really freaked out at this point so I went to the middle of the bus with my friend. We found a set of empty seats a little bit later and the man followed suit. He sat behind us, perpendicularly. He was staring at me the entire time. My friend and I discussed what we should do, since at this point it was extremely likely he was going to follow us home. We decided to not get off the stop we normally get off at to go home but to go to UBC instead, so he can’t find out where we live. Sure enough, he did follow us off the bus at the bus loop. We walked, arms linked, and decided to go to shoppers, where we could maybe talk to the security guard there. He followed us into Shoppers, walking extremely close to us, maybe a few feet. I had 911 ready at the press of a button in case we needed it. I bought a few things and he kept standing at the end of the aisle staring at us. My friend then turned around and told him to quit following us. He mumbled “yeah sure okay” and turned around. He ended up continuing his stalking shortly after. While heading out, I spoke to the security guard telling him he’s been following us and if he could do anything about it. He tried to hold him back but the man just brushed him off. We’re right outside of shoppers at this point, and once again my friend turned around and told him “i told you to stop following us” (what a badass) and again he mumbled “oh ya sorry” and turned in the other direction. We stared at him for a few seconds to make sure he wouldn’t turn around. I dragged my friend to turn the corner towards the hospital since that way is a more secure way to get home without him following us. We turned the corner and stood there for a moment. Then we saw him SPRINT towards our apartments direction (the mcdonalds area). He was actually trying to fake us out and he thought he lost us so he sprinted in the direction he thought we went. My friend and I stood by the corner with our mouths hanging open, terrified. We managed to get home without running into him again. But what an experience, stay safe on transit everyone and please try to help someone out if they were in our position!","#12733

TW: mental health, suicide, self-harm
A little back story first… in the past, I have always had friends. I was the popular girl, and was always invited to all the parties. I was happy, and mental health was never a problem for me.
So back to the present, I came to UBC with a couple of friends from high school, but I was excited to make some new friends at uni. At first, I had a couple of friends - or so I thought. Gradually, my “friends” began drifting away from me. It started by them not including me in their conversations; I told myself that they didn't intend to. The disclusion eventually led to them not inviting me when they would all hang out together. At this point, I decided that they weren’t good friends, and needless to say, I was devastated. I decided to reach out to my old friends from high school, but they were all too busy hanging out with their new friends. I have never felt lonelier in my life. I didn't have any friends willing to hang out with me, I was flunking all my courses, and I just couldn’t handle it anymore. I was in so much pain and I didn't know how to handle it anymore; so I began cutting my forearms and thighs. I tried my best to work harder on my courses, but with seven midterms and multiple papers I needed to hand in, I just couldn't do it anymore. I stopped going to class, and my self-harm eventually led me to get stitches. I lied to the doctor and told him that I was cooking and my knife slipped. I could tell that he knew that I was lying. I went home after going to the hospital and began slitting my wrists, and rummaged through my closet to find the kit I’d prepared earlier in case I ever needed to kill myself. I grabbed my pills, alcohol, and the pre-tied noose. I began opening the bottles of pills, while my arms became covered in blood. I placed the noose around my neck when suddenly, my dog came running in holding his leash in his mouth. At that moment, I knew that I had to stay alive for my dog, even though I wanted to die.
I am now seeing a therapist, a psychologist, and a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and generalised anxiety disorder. Although I still struggle with self-harm and suicidal thoughts, I know that I need to stay alive for my dog; I didn't want him to lose me, I’d rather have me lose him.","#12702

Dissimilarly to OP, I cashed in on my love for exhibitionism and my genetics. I sold enough custom nudes to pay for the whole year's tuition and got my then-best friend, now boyfriend and I both switches.
I don't really do it anymore, because we became official and it didn't feel right, but still kind of feel a sense of accomplishment knowing that my naked body paid for me to crush my bf at Splatoon.

To the man who decided his small dog was Usain Bolt:
I watched you biking down main mall with the speed and determination of someone in the Tour de France. I also watched your tiny, fluffy dog running like his life depended on it to keep up with you (he was attached to your bike with a leash, so his life most likely did depend on it). Why did you decide this is appropriate? The world may never know. But I truly hope you use more than one brain cell next time you decide to bike 200mph down the entire length of main mall while making your small dog exert his entire life force to keep up.

I can’t believe that AMS booking reps prioritize paid bookings over student club bookings. This is completely unacceptable. I heard that 3 clubs had to share 1 space because the film production bought out multiple event spaces that had already been booked by student clubs. The booking reps FAILED to send an email stating that the space had been paid for and is no longer available to said clubs. They also failed to email clubs that had been relocated due to this fiasco, and multiple clubs showed up to the same event space thinking they had booked it.

CW: Depression, suicide
Does anyone else find it slightly off-putting when people say that depression ""can become manageable"" or is ""treatable""?
Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that people who try to encourage depressed people by saying these things have nothing but the best intentions. I appreciate the gesture.
However, I just find these sorts of encouragements to be quite vague. Like, what does ""manageable"" even mean? In some ways I'd say that I'm pretty good at ""managing"" my depression in that I'm, all things considered, quite functional in performing day-to-day tasks (i.e. I get good grades for the most part) and interacting with people in an amiable way. However, none of that changes the fact that I can't get through 10 waking minutes without thinking about killing myself and generally feeling miserable, and it's been that way for almost 2 years now (I had dysthymia before that). If managing and getting treatment just means pressing on through constant mental torture with no foreseeable end, I don't really see the point. Maybe the issue is that my depression appears to be treatment-resistant.
It feels kinda awful to say this, but I often feel as though most encouragement of this sort is given more for the benefit of those who would potentially be left behind by a suicide, rather than suicidal people themselves. It's probably a noble goal to want to preemptively save people from the pain of losing someone they care about to suicide, but I feel like this goal doesn't particularly benefit me (not that everything has to be about me, of course). The fact is, I want to kill myself, as killing myself would likely yield the result that I want (being nothing is better than being in constant pain). I choose to ""manage"" and seek out treatment because I don't want my family/friends to suffer. But I don't know if I can keep this up for much longer.","#12659

Where to even start. I'm feeling such a mix of disappointment and frustration that this is probably just going to end up as an incoherent rant.
So I'm aware there's rampant cheating and academic dishonesty going on, but during my time at UBC I've never really encountered it. But now that I've actually been more exposed to it, I'm extremely disappointed. I guess both at how money really runs the world and academic institutions for letting it happen.
Without revealing too much, my boss's family does a side job of being an agent for international students as well as a ""tutor"". And I can say none of these students take studying seriously at all. ""Tutoring"" as in my boss and her MIL who actually runs the ""tutoring"" place literally completes all the assignments and online quizzes for the students. They justify it with the excuse that the students' English are so bad they don't understand lectures nor homework questions.
Now I'm probably going to come off as xenophobic, but if your English is so bad that you can't understand your classes nor your homework and have to rely on paying your way through, why should you even be here and rob someone else of the opportunity? Not to mention being deadweight in group assignments. But it's well known lecturers and TAs don't do jack shit regarding near illiterate group members as many people have testified. A 3rd year friend of mine had a group member plagiarize their entire paper section - straight up copy pasted from Google. I'm guessing the reason you're even third year is because you've paid to have your essays written for you in the past two years? At least have the decency to do the same for group assignments instead of dragging everyone else down.
At the same time, I feel like the reason my boss is caught up in this is because it ends up being such a vicious cycle (and good money). Since other people in her life didn't treat education as something important, I feel like she doesn't see anything wrong with cheating either. Whenever I try to talk to her about the issue, she comes up with so many examples of cheating and the ""at least I don't do that"" excuse. From talking to her, I've learned of some of the more drastic ways of cheating such as some of the more wealthy students paying someone to stand in for them for their entire ungrad. As in they'll apply to UBC with their name, but will have someone else come in and their face printed on the student card, so this second person can sit in at exams. She's also a UBC grad and tells me how an old classmate of hers had his dad make multiple generous donations to UBC to take his son off academic probation and graduate safely.
I don't know where I'm going with this but my rant is getting too long. Anyway, she's tried to get me in on it by asking me to help her complete student assignments - hell, no. I've made it abundantly clear I wouldn't be doing anything even mildly academically dishonest.
I'd really like to report her and the entire list of names of her students, but I can't lose my job.","#12645

As in they'll apply to UBC with their name, but will have someone else come in and their face printed on the student card, so this second person can sit in at exams. She's also a UBC grad and tells me how an old classmate of hers had his dad make multiple generous donations to UBC to take his son off academic probation and graduate safely.
I don't know where I'm going with this but my rant is getting too long. Anyway, she's tried to get me in on it by asking me to help her complete student assignments - hell, no. I've made it abundantly clear I wouldn't be doing anything even mildly academically dishonest.
I'd really like to report her and the entire list of names of her students, but I can't lose my job.",,1574975702,,,95,21,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2812401365444805&id=1287650764586547,

It rattles me sometimes see some of the coldest people I’ve encountered post about mental health awareness. Cute trendy posts with lots of emojis and suggestions for self-care, but no sense of real-world application when it comes to treating others with kindness. Recently asked my group project partner to take on his fair share of the work (right now the split is 30/70 him/me), explaining I was in a tough spot with workload right now and struggling to hold myself together. I thought he would understand. He barely blinked when I told him I was having a hard time, then told me he didn’t know much about the section I was asking him to take over and couldn’t do it. This is a research project... we have to teach everything to ourselves. We’re somewhat friends and I know for a fact that he has the time to help me out. Worse is that when we were paired for a group project last year, I knew he was in a tight spot at that time, so I offered to do a larger portion of the work because I genuinely wanted to take some stress of his shoulders. I didn’t do this to bank favours for later, but it feels bad to know that when the tables are turned I can’t rely on him. The truth is that self-care is important, of course! But support from others is what we need to help us through the tough spots. I’m happy to see a more progressive stance on mental health become mainstream, but it’s so frustrating to see people preaching this stuff while refusing to acknowledge making a change starts with how you treat the people around you.","#12643

There's this girl that I like in my class. I asked her if she wanted to be in my LING group for a group project at UBC, and she accepted. I doubt she'll ever like me, but the closest we have been was being in the same cell and masturbating.
Sometimes it's by accident, but most of the times I will intentionally go to the place that she's in and start fapping. She'll be typing in data for the project, and I'll just be there for her, if she needs anything. It feels really nice, being there... with her... feeling like I'm inside her. Sometimes I'll go to the cell beside hers, and it still feels really nice being really close to her. Yet, it still sometimes feel like I'm so far from her, since we're just in cells. It feels like we're in a bedroom when I'm jerking off in her cell, but nope... we're just in a cell, not my bedroom. Sometimes, I think these cells are small rooms and we are prisoners locked up... or maybe we're a monk and nun sleeping together. But no, they're cells in a sheet. I sometimes imagine the sheet being a bed sheet, and... we're having sex in the sheet. But, no it's not a bed sheet. It's a Google Sheet, sadly. I wank really hard every once in a while we are working on the same cell for our group project in the same bed - I mean google sheet. I would like to thank Google; if we get married, it'll all be thanks to you.","#12641

I have seen so many confessions talking about mental health problems. I'd like to tell my own story and hope it might be helpful to some of you.
I was admitted in to a very competitive program under Sauder. After two weeks in Sauder, I found myself really unhappy because I didn't like the vibes there. It started to affect my mental health. I didn't like it when most of the Sauder kids seemed to care about nothing but grades, internship experiences, VP positions... I never visited any counselling service in my life because of all the stigmas in the society and the culture where I grew up. But I did. I went to the Residence Counselling (highly recommended if you live in any campus residence), after which I did a thorough reflection of my life and myself, and decided to switch from Bachelor of Commerce to Bachelor of Arts to study what I'm passionate about.
People around me couldn't understand. It's indeed challenging and difficult to get into Sauder and the title of the degree is decent. But it wasn't what I wanted. People always make jokes about my major and about how it will end up with unemployment, but I'm happy with my life now. I'm living my own life and I don't feel anything that can negatively affect my mental health. I guess one good way to take care of your mental health is to ask yourself what you really love and what you really want, then start bravely pursuing it. If something makes you unhappy, stay away from it. Perhaps this choice means risks and giving up something, but your should always prioritize your health. If your mental health is being taken good care of, you can actually have more energy (e.g. to strive for better grades) and uncover more potential in yourself.
Also a random comment on the endless commerce-arts hierarchy battle: honestly, I think studying arts can be more challenging because it requires more intellectual thinking and understanding. Commerce courses are intense and dense, but your grade reflects the time you have invested. But this is not the case with Arts courses. I got full marks in two quizzes when in Sauder...now? No Way.","#12637

So I'm staying on res, right?
This morning, I try to sleep in a little (been heavily sleep deprived, it's that time of the semester, you know the drill) and set my alarm 20 minutes before I'm supposed to be in class.
I decide to get dressed before going to the bathroom so that way I can just brush my teeth after and go out the door.
I get my pants on, and suddenly, without warning, my bladder decides it needs to relieve itself. Like, now.
I'm standing there, bouncing up and down, trying my best to hold it. I know if I start to walk, it's just gonna go. So I try really hard to focus and get a grip so i can hold it and then make a dart for the bathroom.
But unfortunately, my bladder has other ideas.
And it just let's go.
Into my only pair of pants that I currently have...
Class started 20 minutes ago. I'm almost failing this course. But all I can do is lie pantsless in bed, waiting for my hand washed pants to dry just enough that I can go into public without having wet pants that smell like urine.
Mom and dad, if you're reading this: your adult child peed their pants today!!! Aren't you proud?!?","#12636

I went to Science advising last year. I was struggling in my classes because my admission offer was withdrawn right before the fall semester was about to start. I appealed but they approved it after school had already started. By the time I got here, I was behind in all my classes. I thought my life was over when I got withdrawn and it was the most difficult time of my life, I shut out anything from my life that reminded me of UBC.
The advisor listened to my situation and deadass asked me why I wasn't studying the materials covered in class at UBC from Canvas during the time when my appeal was ongoing.
I just stared at her with no words. She made me drop a class and advised me to take it next term even though I was doing terrible in it. Next term I failed that class. So it was a total waste of $8000 (international tuition).
Now I really need help with some things regarding what classes i should be taking because I'm on academic probation and I don't think I'll have good enough grades to qualify for any specialzation but I'm honestly scared of going back there.","#12630

Hello, your friendly Philosophy Major here!
You think that your degree is best? Think again! ""Ohhh I'm a science student. We have everything figured out. We only deal in concrete realities that we can empirically prove"". Cavemen. Your studies would make no sense without a philosophy of science. Do you ever stop and evaluate how the scientific method could be flawed? It can't show causation at all, only conjunction. Y'all can't even precisely measure the position and momentum of a particle. How do you deal with all that uncertainty? I'll tell you: philosophy.
Sauder... Do you ever think about the point of what you're doing? Trying to make yourselves affluent enough to impress people with your Black Astrum business cards and fancy suits? Why do you want that? Does wealth actually have intrinsic worth, or are you using it instrumentally for something else that you value? Why do you value that other thing? Does that other thing truly have intrinsic value? You need value theory to evaluate that, which means - you guessed it - philosophy!
Political Science... what the hell does science even have to do with politics? It's just the application of political philosophy. Y'all can argue over the best way to create an electoral system that gives everyone an equal voice, find ways to support free speech, and create a ""just"" judicial system. Why the hell would you want to give everyone an equal voice? And free speech, why do you think that's a good idea? What is justice? To determine those you need philosophy!
Engineering... You jerks. You know that you got better grades than I and you have to go flaunting it around with your red jackets and iron rings... Have fun being useful, getting a proper wage, and gaining the admiration of those around you while I face a lack of professional employability and a decreasing number of available positions in academia. I wish I could be like you, but instead here I am paying tuition so I can argue about the ontology of fictional objects.
Sincerely,
A Philosophy Major","#12609

Gentle reminder to take care of yourself before midterms and finals. I know you’re stressed and cramming, but for god’s sake, eat before you come to write the paper, and get your flu shots. If I hear your stomach growling or you coughing, sneezing and sniffling the whole time, I might just call you out publicly.
Also special mention to my people who stress themselves into an upset stomach. FYI: we can tell hunger sounds from imminent explosive diarrhea. I feel for you though. No shade, just eat something fibrous and basic. And try some mindful meditating/challenging irrational and stressful thoughts. You will get through this. We all will.

I bet dollars to doughnuts UBC is the must-try place with interesting people based on what I've seen in UBC Confessions.
A UBC professor did the Naruto run in front of his or her student (#12080)
A UBC couple acknowledged they were having sex on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Musqueam people (#12569)
Pennywise tried to lure poor and broke UBC students by offering free tuition and all sorts of surprises down in the sewer at UBC (#12561)

A UBC professor did the Naruto run in front of his or her student (#12080)
A UBC couple acknowledged they were having sex on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Musqueam people (#12569)
Pennywise tried to lure poor and broke UBC students by offering free tuition and all sorts of surprises down in the sewer at UBC (#12561)

People act as if LGBT people who are straight-passing should have some sort of humility because they have the privilege of passing as straight. I notice it especially in Vancouver for some reason. Honestly wtf? I'm not any less gay just because I'm currently in a heterosexual relationship. Have any of these people ever considered that LGBT people who are straight-passing take advantage of their privilege in order to protect themselves from homophobic family or peers? Like I'm sorry that I'm apparently ""not gay enough"" because I currently love someone of the opposite gender and don't want to be disowned lol","#12603

Resent to UBC Confessions in case UofT Confessions doesn't post this.
I'm an exchange student from UofT studying at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
I can't leave. I've been desperately trying to escape but can't because I look Chinese. Myself, as well as normal mainlanders and Chinese-Americans, are trapped and unable to leave through the only authorized exit because we'll be arrested and beaten by the police.
I love Hong Kong, but I don't want to die here. The protesters have mostly accepted their fate, but I don't have the ""I don't have anything to lose"" mentality here.
A truck tried to ram into the barricade and the protesters are keeping us safe, but I don't have much confidence in their ability to hold this off for much longer.
There's talk of an armed attack on us by the police. Make no mistake, the protesters will lose. They're outnumbered, outgunned and outmatched.
I just want to leave but I can't reach anyone at UofT, and the consulate has limited ability to help us right now.
Please help us. We're trapped and we don't want to die here shot to death by a foreign police force.","#12602

TLDR; Never set off a fake fire alarm, once set an actual fire.
In all my time at UBC, I have never set off a fire alarm. I always thought the dozens of people who triggered the detectors over popcorn in my first year at Vanier were fools. It is my fourth and last year, and I thought my record would go unchanged.
I moved to a house with especially sensitive fire alarms, and all my roommates have set them off at least once. So when I was cooking, waiting for the oil to heat up, I left for a couple minutes to take off my contacts in the bathroom (right next to the kitchen). When the smoke detector started blaring, I figured it was finally my turn, after four years, to set off a false alarm.
I got out of the bathroom, expecting a bit of smoke that had somehow escaped the stove fans. I was ready to grab a chair and manually turn off the smoke alarms.
My entire. Fucking. Frying pan. Was on fire.
I'm talking flames half a foot tall, filling the entire circumference of my neon colored frying pan. I grabbed the handle, not really knowing what to do after. Would dumping it in the sink kill the fire or burn the kitchen down? But as i waved it around in the air, and the pan was away from the stove's surface, the fire started dying bit by bit. There was a moment where a bit of flame fell onto the stove burner and lasted for a couple seconds, before it thankfully died out.
My frying pan was charred. My roommates were hysterical (or in hysterics, because they have no sympathy) It was chaos.
Anyway, don't leave your cooking unattended kids.","#12598

As of the few days of the strike against Translink, I love seeing our bus-driving homies in turtleneck sweaters or hoodies. It makes me feel right at home to be driven to UBC by a lad in a baseball cap.
I'm incredibly glad that it's just a maintenance and overtime ban, and not a full-scale strike. I'm grateful of the transit system we have in moments like these. (I just got my bike stolen right before the strike, thanks Vancouver)
Also, I'm not for/against Translink or the union - I'm just incredibly amused at the situation right now, where both sides are playing ""I'm baby 🥺🥺🥺"" and looking to win over the public.
---
Using my pea-sized 3rd year Undergraduate brain, here is my opinion:
Unifor at this point is probably run by delusional social justice warriors. Solution: Hire a Goddamn chimpanzee, give them a calculator and it'd figure out that the additional 680 million over 10 years as a result from 15.2% wage increase compounded over 4 years for bus drivers among other demands - is equivalent to a kid throwing a temper tantrum. You are chopping off the hand that feeds you. How do you expect Translink to perform, and keep the same level employment if you're sucking them dry? Defined and reasonable breaks for your union members: Reasonable! Essentially sabotaging your employer: Lunacy!
Translink holy FUCK, have y'all heard of the SECOND WELFARE THEOREM? Give those hard-working, workers with high-marginal utility a peace of mind, and some breaks. Also, do you read your own annual reports? (https://www.translink.ca/About-Us/Corporate-Overview/Corporate-Reports.aspx). Can't you just funnel a bit of that accumulated surplus into helping out some workers? Just hold it out and show some decency before AI operated vehicles?
All in all, can we get an F in the chat for our bus-driving homies? Thank you.

Somebody hold my lab goggles cause I'm about to start a riot from a whole spread of students who brag about being on the Dean's List. Obligatory ""why are so many of y'all so judgmental when we're going to have the exact same barely above minimum wage job after graduation anyways"".
I'll get this out of the way because it's what spurred this whole argument: behavioural neuroscience is not just glorified psychology. I don't know why there is an impression that the entrance average is low to mid-70s and so the whole cohort can barely generate one action potential to store a single fact using our net two synaptic connections. Half the people I know in this major are gunning for med school, have part-time jobs and executive positions in clubs, won NSERC awards while working in two labs, all on top of having 30 credits with three 3 hours labs per week (shout out to 2nd year where I aged from a sweet, summer child to a starving war veteran with only one lung that I have to use while wheezing through 370). Do we take a lot of PSYC courses? Yes. Do we also take physics, chemistry, biochem, anatomy and biology at the same time? Absolutely. Name a general PSYC course that will allow you to hold someone's brain. Direct me to a syllabus that says the exact mechanism for memory encoding will be covered. Tell me who knows which experimental method is best for mapping functional connections. Every time I have to sift through a 60 page reading and practically rediscover how you hoes know how to see, I want to blind myself whenever I see people talk about how CAPS/PHRM/ISCI are the end all be all of this existence and that everyone else is going to be jobless. Newsflash: no one is exempt from our dying economy and inflation of life science students. Employers do not care if you got 91 on a 30% midterm. Sir, this is an Arby's.
I have literally no idea why some people believe that they are above others in this faculty when we all take the same courses. And get the SAME GRADES. But some people will only care about wack ass titles. If physiology accepted 300 people per year, do you still think students would feel the same way? I rejected my CAPS offer because I didn't want to be surrounded by people with a ""grades are everything"" mindset and there's practically no advantage at the end of the day - it all depends on what you do on your own time. You're really gonna sit here and tell me that being in your cohort of 20 people who will likely bald by 40 is an invaluable privilege. On the other side of the spectrum, the fact that there are people who can customize their entire degree so that they will only take courses with high averages/easy assessments/straight forward content, and STILL humble brag about their GPA. I know you're taking 4 classes that aren't even related and are sleeping in lectures, but of course you're practically already a doctor! The future of healthcare are students who want to take the easiest route to an MD. The system plays itself.
You really be looking like booboo the damn fool if you think the major of your undergraduate degree makes you better than anyone else. We should be suffering together, crying together, wanting to die together; bringing others down gives you nothing but a superiority complex. Stop claiming that you're med school-bound when your MCAT score was 500, <redacted name>.","#12547
Somebody hold my lab goggles cause I'm about to start a riot from a whole spread of students who brag about being on the Dean's List. Obligatory ""why are so many of y'all so judgmental when we're going to have the exact same barely above minimum wage job after graduation anyways"".

It's about that time of year again where my school work has begun to make me question my life, but this year it is different. This year I have finally realized that school is all I have left. This is the only thing I am good at. I have devoted my entire life since the beginning of high school to getting good grades and now good grades are the only thing I judge my own self worth by. If I let my grades slip even a little I will officially have nothing I can be proud of. I have given up everything in my life just to focus on this one thing I am good at. No other skills because I gave up all my hobbies. No more real friends because I cancel all of our plans to study. I lash out at my family in an attempt to make them stop distracting me from my schoolwork. I have never been able to hold down a long-lasting relationship, or pretty much any relationship. I don't know if my grades will ever be useful or get me a good job or anything and I don't care. I just know that if I slip up for even a moment all of these years of my life and all the things I have given up will have been for nothing, so I just keep blindly working.","#12546

Below is the secret recipe
and I hope this would help you get at least 85% on a presentation:
#1. Put sunglasses on!
#2. Put a pair of jeans from Calvin K*eins or if you are a girl, you should put a pair of leggings from Lulul*mon.
Please note: For the protection of privacy, I am not revealing the full name of any company in the post.
Most importantly, if you identify yourself neither male nor female, you can wear your 2nd favourite pants, leggings or skirts that you could find at home :)
#3. Go to Youtube and search for, ""I am a barbie girl in the barbie world""
(Alternatively, ""I want it that way - Backstreet Boys"" should work)
#4. Listen, sing, and dance accordingly to either of the two songs I mentioned in #3.
#5. Once the song is over, go find the nearest Korean whom you know of.
#6. Ask with courtesy and respect, ""What does your father do for a living?""
#7. Go to one of: Cost*o, Wa*mart, Who*e foods Market, Save-On-Fo*ds, and Saf*way and purchase some orange juice for your happiness!
#8. Get out of your house in pajamas and stare at the sky at 8:53pm and say, ""Thank you, you're the best person on earth, OP, you're literally a living legend who lives in Vancouver!""
#9. Say with confidence, ""Ho-Ho-Ho! Merry Christmas and happy 2023!"" at the nearest Tim Hor*ons from your home.
(Do not ever say hoe-hoe-hoe at the Tims, okay?! I don't want you to sound rude to others!"")
#10. Type, ""Weird flex, and it's not okay"" after reading this post or
alternatively you could leave a comment with the information below!

TL:DR Don't be worried that you are still a virgin and single, live your life and love yourself, go at life at your own pace.
Going into uni (and pretty much all of high school), I've always been insecure that I am still a virgin and I will be single for life. So going into uni, I asked every second girl out and just wanna get laid. Rejection and after rejection, I felt worse and worse as I started losing hope in myself. I thought not a girl in the world will ever like me back. Why? Because I treated them as trophies and if I ever get laid, that means I am officially a man and officially earned the trophy of finally having sex with a girl. So I asked out girls as if they are just good job medals.
I am in second year now, and I had a whole summer to think over this. I tell people that I will definitely get laid this year, except something changed. I don't. Why should I bother about what others say? What if I am a virgin? Who the fuck cares? It was only me who cared. I cared about how society and my friends will think that I am a loser for still being a virgin. But do they really? Fuck no. They don't, in fact, nobody cares. (Well, if they do, I shouldn't even be friends with them in the first place). Girls aren't just objects to fuck, they are human beings too. Some of them are kind, some are funny, and a lot of them are just an absolute blast to be around with. All my friends are getting into relationships, I am happy for them, but why should I care that I still haven't found a girlfriend yet? I need to go at life at my own pace, not how the society wants and not how my friends are going.
I started to make myself more occupied. I started going to more clubs, discovering more interests, and found and met more girl friend that I genuinely enjoy hanging out with. My insecurity will also be there, but for now, I am gonna occupy myself and need to finish Link's Awakening before finals season.
Be happy with yourself first, nobody gives a shit that you're still a virgin.","#12121
TL:DR Don't be worried that you are still a virgin and single, live your life and love yourself, go at life at your own pace.
Going into uni (and pretty much all of high school), I've always been insecure that I am still a virgin and I will be single for life. So going into uni, I asked every second girl out and just wanna get laid. Rejection and after rejection, I felt worse and worse as I started losing hope in myself. I thought not a girl in the world will ever like me back. Why? Because I treated them as trophies and if I ever get laid, that means I am officially a man and officially earned the trophy of finally having sex with a girl. So I asked out girls as if they are just good job medals.

UBC is a very messy and dirty place confirmed.
I went to get blood work done to get checked for STDs at the UBC hospital (like HIV) before I began being sexually actively with my boyfriend. The guy was asking me if getting tested for HIV was a requirement for UBC students because literally everyone was getting tested?

Well I have a doozy of a story about how rude and down right crazy people can be here. I have submitted in this confession my statement of events which I submitted to campus security after a confrontation that occurred when I came to use a study room in Woodward. I walked into a study room with my headphones in and I had a student rudely tell me to leave, even though she hadn't booked the room and it was just her in the room.
""I came into a room at Woodward to study and proceeded to sit down when the person who was in the room told me to leave in a very rude way. I asked her nicely if she had booked the room, she said no. I told her that then she didn't have the right to limit others from using the room. She threatened to call security and I said okay, then i sat down and wrote this. I was on the phone with my girlfriend when I came in, I did not speak to my girlfriend as to not disrupt the student studying here, but my girlfriend was able to hear the exchange. As I went to work the student called security and said that I was being abusive and disruptive to her, and proceeded to insult me to my face (called me an asshole and what not). After her call with security she proceeded to keep the door open and play her computer at full volume while I wrote this and studied. ""
Afterwards when I was talking to security they informed me that she has called the police about the incident and was requesting a ride to the police station so she could tell them. I have rarely if ever in my life ever seen a stranger act over the top about such a trivial matter especially one where they are in the wrong. She wasted my time, her own time, campus security, an 911 operators time and that of the police. Over what amounted to a temper tantrum over someone wanting a large study room entirely to herself. I'm normally not such a suborn individual I don't think I could handle someone who acts like her get her way, just because she wants to make a fuss. So please everyone be kind to each other, share study spaces because we all need them and please be grown up enough to not waste other peoples time with such inconsequential bullshit.

The times you sacrificed study time to check in with a friend youre worried about, and the time you spend just trying to arrange plans to meet up. This is for you. You are worthy of a friendship where the other party is just as dedicated as you are. A friendship where they also understand that this isnt high school anymore and friendships take some effort. Where they value your love and care and return it as well. If theres a ""friendship"" or any relationship in your life where you dont feel like you are valued in, drop it. Sure, you might think youre ok with it now, but when push comes to pull, they arent going to be there for you when you have a bad day or do poorly on an exam. Theyll reply with ""oof"" if they even reply at all, and continue on with their selfish self. Its not up to you to change them, they have to learn themselves. They only deserve what they give.

I’m a science student. I’m taking an upper level course. The assignments are pretty tough and time consuming. Once, my friend took me to an off campus private tutorial for that course. I went with my friend since it was free at the first time. They gave us ‘lecture slides’ which was the solution of our future assignment. I was shocked and I knew that was cheating. I didn’t report it since I didn’t want to bring troubles to my friends. I decided to not study with those friends even though they are nice people.
One day, I went to a TA hour. Some people in my table talked about their hometown but not in English. TA was friendly and helpful. TA told us to be careful with plagiarism and reminded us of the collaboration rules when he was about to leave. Why? I’ve never heard that in TA hour before. I believe if those people want to cheat, they can get answers way much easier and won’t waste time in TA hours. Not all international students will cheat. Please don’t make assumption on every of us.

I would like to sincerely apologise in advance!

It makes me happy to see this because I am the most evil person you could ask for when it comes to transit HAHAHAHA!

Then I'd scream internally and be like, ""Yes cheers amigos! The weather is so bad and they just missed their bus!"" Or when they have their kinesiology or chemistry exam and miss their bus and don't make it to the exam on time and their prof doesn't allow them entry to their midterm and give them a zero for not showing up to class on time!

Trigger Warning: death of family
It's been years since my dad died, and honestly I thought I should have gotten over it by now. But lately, I've just been dwelling over it non-stop. I've been having dreams about him; one time it was when I met him for the first time (since I do not remember him, I was very young when he died), and when I woke up I just cried. Recently, I had another one where I was asking why he died, and if he even thought of me when he committed suicide, and all I remember what he said is that it had something to do with hate and heartbreak. My grandmother told me that as well, but I can't help but feel I don't have all the answers. I just wish I met him once, and I get so sad thinking about it. I come from a family with a history of addiction, and I am the first and only one to go to post secondary, let alone UBC engineering. It's my first year, and I already feel like an outcast. I see all these other students with well-to-do, loving families, and I just can't help but feel jealous. Many of them make fun of kids like me, how they all they its bullshit that kids like me get benefits because of our pasts. But many of them also don't understand what it's like; I would give it all away just to have him back, and have a normal family. Nobody knows the inner struggles I have to face everyday, but I so badly want to have that one person I could turn to. I kept telling myself I was over it, but that was just a facade to avoid the fact that I'm really not okay. I've never talked about my feelings like this... Sometimes I just stare in the mirror and wonder if he would be proud of me. Others say so, but I just don't know. Growing up without a male role model is tough; it's just so unfair. I know it sounds narcissistic, but I just want my dad back... My family tells me how much I'm alike him: I eat the same things, have the same hobbies, and the fact that I look exactly like him. I never had much friends growing up, and sometimes I wonder how different life would have been if he were around. I feel bad for ranting on UBC confessions, but I don't know where else to turn to right now.","#12087

Trigger Warning
I wanted to get some stuff off my chest. Second year was hard. I had a very good average in first year and was in a competitive major. But last year, I ended up failing half my classes and was kicked out of UBC. I know I definitely could have worked harder but I was dealing with a lot of personal problems that made it hard to focus.
I felt so inadequate and truly hated myself. I fucked up my life and I was letting my parents down. (They payed so much money to give me the opportunity to study in Canada).
After I wrote my finals, I felt very emotional and I wanted to do something really self destructive. I’m not proud of this but I went back to my dorm and got very very drunk. At one point I was laying on my back and could hardly move because I was so incapacitated. I threw up and probably would have died if I didn’t somehow force myself to roll over.
But I still didn’t learn my lesson, because my self destructive behaviour continued the next day. And I decided to hook up with a stranger who was 10 years older than me. I thought I could handle it but I was pretty uncomfortable and I started crying in the middle of it. He realized I was not okay so we stopped and I left.
I’m deeply ashamed of this and I keep questioning what is wrong with me and why I would do something like that?","#12085

So I went to the campus pool the other day and that place is trash. I am not a picky person and Ive swam in plenty of pools, used to swim competitively but holy shit.... The change rooms are dirty, the lockers are broken, one of the tanks is closed because the roof is cracked, only like one lane was open in the other pool. Sauna is barely warm, steam room smells like ass and the hot tub is slimy like someone dumped some jello in it. And all the lifeguards do is just stand around and talk to each other. I tried to ask one of them a couple of questions and they just scratched their ass and said they’ll talk to their manager. And after like twenty minutes of standing around they finally went into their first aid room, LITERALLY MADE OUT WITH another lifeguard for five minutes and then that other lifeguard came out and told me that if I have any questions(I was asking about the lane swimming schedule like they should know this) I should come tomorrow because all of their managers and supervisors have left for the day. It wasn’t even 5pm yet. 1/10 never going to that shithole again. Give me a city pool any day over that crap.","#12074

UBC confessions (its amazing, cool, fun and admins are creative, hands down guys, you make my days)
UBC New bus loop (it looks so weird and you can easily get lost, so need to go to any play land)
UBC construction (I don't think we can live without fences anymore, when i go back to china to visit my parents i put broken boxes on the way from the kitchen to my room, i became addicted) my parents think that i lost my mind
UBC crushes (its cute and sexy, those students that are struggling with their courses but are as well in love with their profs)
UBC Walid (the most amazing prof i have ever had, i think if you haven't had Walid at UBC, you are missing a lot, and you haven't seen a lovely caring person, supportive and so motivational like him, he really cares about you :), and OMG his stories are the best, Chem 233 was full of lovely organic chemistry stories- thank you love (love you) - a grateful fan of your students, you need to run for presidency 2019 #Walid2019

Happy rain season, it’s been 2 days and I can already tell some of you need umbrella etiquette classes so here we go.
1: You do NOT need a golf umbrella to walk to class. If it can fit 3 people under it you better have 3 people under it. If I see one more group of 3 Apple Theta Pie girls carrying 3 golf umbrellas side by side down main mall I’m gonna McLoseIt.
2: When walking through a crowd you raise your umbrella up. That way you don’t stab people in the eyes cuz you are oblivious to your surroundings. If you are too short to be able to lift it above peoples heads use a rain jacket or put it away in crowds.
3: Lastly, look around before you shake that thing off. Your umbrella being dry is less important than the 4 people you just splashed behind you.

Someone who would have been blinded today if I didn’t wear glasses","#12069

So my dad is a prof at SFU who just got transferred here to UBC where I study. So they pulled me out the dorm and now I'm living with my parents and triplet brother sister sister sibling set who go to U Hill school. And that's a problem cuz I went from being able to do whatever to basically going back to high school where I have to share a room with my brother cuz both my sisters share a room. That's a problem cuz in a house with only one bathroom I have nowhere to jerk off.
So I do it on the back row of HEBB in the aforementioned seat. So please don't sit there cuz you may sit on my seed. And if you are waman, I don't wanna get you preggers by you sitting in the wrong place during the wrong time of the month.

I must say that as a first-year at UBC, I am absolutely disgusted by the rape culture that exists at here. I've had so many friends tell me about being touched/groped/molested at events and it's sickening to hear. The fact that so many grown-ass men (and yes, they are grown-ass whether they like it or not, everyone here is an adult now) don't know how to act like gentlemen, the fact that so many grown-ass men lack class, dignity, and accountability, the fact that so many grown-ass men don't know that they should never touch a woman like that without their permission, speaks a lot about this university as a whole. We have unfortunately low standards. My emphasis is on class. UBC is a world-class university. It's time people started living up to name. You may have been raised in classless families that didn't teach moral values. But you are here now. So smarten up. No wonder society is so fucked these days, even in the supposedly elite communities people act like uneducated peasants.","#12062

We dont want to drag ourselves up that stupid hill after labs, classes and events bc we're so worn out at the end of the day. Many, many people live up on Academy now, including me.

I went to the bathroom today when I really had to pee on campus.
The sign said “male” and I walked in.
I couldn't help but thing that some people in the moment of distress of needing to pee cant because UBC is so backwards compared to other campuses across the country that our bathrooms (and this was a single bathroom) are gendered.
Why should some students have to forgive hydrating themselves and being healthy so they dont have to run all over campus to find a bathroom they’d be accepted in? Why in a place where people are supposed to be educated we care who uses a bathroom? It should just be a bathroom and non discriminatory. Anyone who wants to use it should be able to, no matter their identity or the discrimination they face (which I’m sure if u have to make a tough call when u need to take a leak, its not the only form of discrimination youre facing.)
Please UBC leave this archaic practice in the history books where it belongs and make the Johnny crapper for everyone","#12059

I find it alarming that the AMS turns a blind eye to the UBC Chinese Students and Scholars Association (an AMS club) and how close they've gotten with the local Chinese consulate in Vancouver over the recent years.
At clubs day, they openly admit to hosting events with the close support of the Chinese consulate in Vancouver and embassy in Ottawa. I'm not saying that this is wrong, because many cultural clubs do the same.
It's one thing to accept sponsorships, and it's another thing to effectively become de facto agents of a foreign state. I am a ABC and I asked my international Chinese student friends and it's an open secret that while they aren't paid spies or professionals, they regularly have meetings with the Chinese consulate that include discussing what is going on at UBC with opposition groups to the mainland, basically making them voluntary snitches.
For example, last year, they reported a law student at UBC to the consulate, which caused the Chinese secret police to show up at his family's home to threaten him into taking down some pro-Tibet posts. The consulate has implied that they should vandalize pro-Hong Kong installations if they could. On the flip side, they weren't responsible for the vandalization of the Falun Gong club's booth even though they were accused of it within some circles, so I get not everything is a Chinese conspiracy.
Yet the AMS doesn't give a shit. Even though the AMS deconstitutes clubs that are too closely affiliated with a charity or other external organization, they are somehow okay with a club basically being a cultural outreach arm of the Chinese consulate in Vancouver. Talk about double standards.
How are we all okay with a foreign government getting to control an AMS club? Yes, president Xi isn't plotting to overtake the UBC campus, but it's still infuriating that they're allowed to get away with it, and get to benefit with our student fees to the AMS.
And it isn't the fact that it's China that I'm upset, I would be just as upset if it turned out the Jewish clubs on campus regularly meet with the Israeli embassy to report on the activities of pro-Palestine groups on-campus.","#12058

I'm finishing up a year long exchange in Australia and my biggest takeaway is that UBC academic culture is RUINING all of our lives. Nobody here is stressing over finding internships and planning the next 20 years of their lives after they graduate... I've spent so many sleepless nights trying to figure out what I'm doing with my arts degree and if I'm wasting time or not and it's so fucked!!! Why can't we just relax like they do here and in Europe and be normal students for a change?? They can open as many 'wellness' centers as they want on campus but it won't change the ultra competitive culture in north american universities that's driving us insane!!!","#12040

My friend told me about a gigantic cheating web in UBC that she's part of too. Personally, I hate cheating.
It's unfair, it brings the reputation of the uni and the worthiness of the diploma down.
Now I know about this, I'm attempted to just report it to the uni and get the organizations smashed.
But I do not want to hurt my friend. It feels like betrayal, if I'm to use info from her to report and all, knowing that she will be impacted as a consequence. Yet she knows my position all along, it also makes me mad thinking that she's so sure of her influence over me, that she believes I won't harm her and would just let it pass.
My parents told me to keep a low profile, to ""unfriend"" her and to delete any group chats that we share. They don't want me to report because it'd be too much trouble, and b/c it's really big and they're concerned of my safety.
I don't know what to do. Suggestion guys? Anything would be appreciated.","#12038

It's been a couple of days, but the day still keeps bugging me.
I was playing ukulele on campus when a random ass dude came up to me and asked me if he could play my uke right in the middle of a song I was playing. Now I hate being interrupted mid-song and leaving a song unfinished, so I told him I need to finish the song first. He then proceeded to keep incessantly asking me to let him play my uke. Now I was hanging out with my stoner friends so there was a bunch of pizza coupons lying on the ground. The dude then picked up the pizza coupons and shoved them into my personal space saying he'd exchange for my uke. At this point, I was completely annoyed and my space was being invaded. I kept telling him no, eventually he got impatient and gave up thankfully. But before he left, he then said that once I was done to come find him so he could play.
First off, FUCK YOU! You are not fucking entitled to my ukulele or any of my possessions for that matter. You do not fucking ask to play my instrument when I'm right in the middle of playing a song. Second, NO MEANS FUCKING NO, you basically violated my space despite me saying no countless times. Even though I couldn't say it at the time for fear of escalation, so I'll just say it now, YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU ENTITLED PIECE OF SHIT.","#12013

Like every try hard high school student, I joined my school's Model United Nations club. For those who don't know what that is, it's a debate lifestyle for socially awkward private school kids to bond, dress up in business casual, and pretend they're making a difference in the world. I stayed for 3 years even though I would never join my school club's mock committees and would just sign up for conferences. Of course I never got any awards.
One day I got talked into applying for a staff position at VMUN (Vancouver Model United Nations) and was miraculously offered an interview. Man. The interview broke something inside of me that day. I was never the same ever since. At the fresh age of 14 I was grilled about 7 ways to use a red paperclip for purposes that it was not intended for, why manhole covers were round, what was my favorite movie and what kind of person did that make me, and forced to sell the interviewers' own pen back to them.
Those questions were a curve ball and I obviously flunked. Now whenever I have interviews, I PREPARE for those stupid ass questions like ""If you were to be any ice cream flavor, what would you be?"" Extreme interview anxiety can go fuck itself. Thanks MUN, I wrote about you on my Personal Statement and it got me into UBC so I guess it worked out.","#12001

He sat down in the priority seating area with his newly acquired industrial grade furniture dolly and proceed to look at everyone on the bus individually to determine their value in the world. At MacDonald St. a young couple boarded the bus with their stroller and young child and headed towards where Gateman was sitting. Most people got up and moved back in the bus as most normal, respectful people would. Not Gateman though. He continued to sit with his industrial grade furniture dolly and would not budge. The mother kindly asked him if he could get up to allow her to park the stroller. In true “I’m a sessional lecturer” fashion, Gateman simply pointed a tad his furniture dolly and refused to move. The mother then get a little frustrated and said “well this is where strollers go so you need to move”. Gateman sighed extremely loudly and then proceeded to say “where would you like me to go”. The mother pointed at a nearby seat and with some serious effort Gateman finally moved. He proceeded to stare at the young child for the whole ride with a highly disgruntled look on his face. @Gateman - I get that you’re only a sessional lecturer and you’re pretty content with making students cry but try to not be an asshole to the general public.

TW: Mental health
Hello I’m a third year and due to poor mental health I had a terrible winter semester. It was so bad I was required to withdraw. Now the month I was supposed to graduate is when I can reapply. I hate this, even though I was in contact with the centre of accessibility I felt like no one was on my side or believed in me. I’ve never felt so alone. There was no warning, I know I’m grown enough to be able to take care of myself. Counselling at school sucks. They made me feel like I wasn’t bad enough or suicidal enough for help. I don’t know I’m just frustrated and feel stupid. I’ll just work in the mean time. I feel like I’m falling behind and just messing everything up. Plus I’m 60+ credits in so I can’t go to another institution and transfer those credits (:
Idk why I shared this—I think I just want to hear something from someone who may have experienced the same or similar thing.","#11984

So, for relevant information, my friend uses they, them pronouns and I will be using those, so no confusion. My friend is also dark skinned and an imigrant, while I am a light skinned asian.
I still respect my friend enough to use appropriate pronouns, but I am feeling like shit right now, and I don't know what to do. So if you guys wanna give me flake about that, I'm having non of that.
It started with us meeting at an lgbt+ event. Anyways, from there, we found out we had a lot in common. They were also depressed, whether it's because we are lgbt+, I don't know, but we had a lot of hardships in common. We had the same interests, which I won't go into, and faced the similar hardships. But a few months in, I felt something change, that or they just hid it. Any time I had issues, they would also tell me how privileged I am and how my issues didn't matter because they have it worse because they were dark skinned and my family and culture was 'more' accepting of lgbt. 'At least your people don't try to kill you'. Sometimes, when they ask me for advice, they would tell me why my responses are naive because, 'I'm not like you. It doesn't work like that for me being dark skinned and from an oppressive culture'. But even that, I was willing to look pass. We all have flaws.
But then came the scariest time. I hate saying this, being depressed and suicidal, I wouldn't want people to think that they should just stop talking about it, but, I don't know what to do. One day, we met up. They were super drunk, and then they started talking about how worthless they felt because of a recent failure (again, not going into). I tried comforting them. I tried telling them it's going to be ok. but i guess i screwed up because they yelled and told me what a liar I was and what a shit friend I was with my privilege, telling them things were sunshines and rainbows. So I sort of lost it. I told them, well then, I guess why did you bother trying something new? They yelled at me and told me what a shit head I was, implying they should kill themselves. I guess in hindsight, it does sound like that. Anyways, they got a little bit physically aggressive, but in the end, I just stormed off and they didn't follow. So I guess that's that. but what do i say? they reject my tough love truth, and they reject my good will. and honestly, hearing suicide scares me. i'm not a therapist, i don't know if i too will get suicidal.
Later, I apologized, which they accepted, but not once did they apologize for all the putting down they did to me.
Anyways, I want to put it here, not because I don't think I'm wrong in that incident, but because I don't know what to do. I have been avoiding them, saying I'm busy, but truth is, I don't know what to do. I want to cut ties with them because I realize our relationship is toxic, no matter how much i love them, but at the same time, I know I am pretty much the opnly lgbt+ person they know who can talk about lgbt+ plus issue. i am so riddled with guilt. i feel like they are right, that my walking away is privilege in itself. I hear so many lgbt+ people dying and maybe if I cut ties, I will be the cause of it. I'm scared. but that drunken day also showed me that brief moment of what could have been violent scared me. What am I supposed to do?
I think my heart will break if I hear my friend is dead. I love this person. They are pretty much the only lgbt+ friend i have as well. but I have other friends who support me, and I don't know if they have any other friend. is it wrong of me to think that sometimes their situation is their own doing? they push people away, hating... i don't know what.
anyways, i have more to say, but i guess this is long. please help me. i am so conflicted...

Gotta pay those bills....and then with Sociology you have to get a master's to do anything with it right?""

As someone who is obsessed with books but has the attention span of a Chihuahua that's accidentally eaten the pot brownie left on the counter: I'm currently in the middle of reading 9 books simultaneously. It's taken a month and I've recently finished one. (An absolute win in my record)
One of the books is from the UBC library. I heard about the fact that you can renew books at the UBC library for an infinite period of time - provided that no one were to request the book. See, this is great for research, someone who wants to learn, or just a scatter-brained bookworm like me. See, the key is provided that no one requests the book.
So, what is happening is that I have to haul my ass to UBC during the few days of my break where I am finally off of both school and work. I haven't had a genuine break in 2 years. Due to the audacity of some absolute nerd who wanted to borrow a book during August (However, I applaud your studiousness), I have to make a 3-hour roundtrip to UBC in a sweaty B-Line bus, or spend a quarter of a million dollars on gas and parking to chug my bitchass, broke-college-student Honda Civic to campus just to return this book.
To the person at the David Lam Library who requested the book I was in the middle of reading: Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries. I wish a reasonable amount of foul karma upon you, hoping that you trip and drop your $1 Vanilla ice-cream cone from Mcdonalds, and that the bookstore runs out of paperback textbooks in all your classes - forcing you to buy hard-covers. Every time you miss your SkyTrain, or hand in an assignment late, think about the time you moderately inconvenienced a poor soul who just wants to enjoy his books and his summer.
Good day to you sir, and a generous ""frick you"".

This happened a while ago, and initially I thought it didn't matter, but I think with recent events, it is more relevant than ever. And sorry if it's long.
I was talking to a (Caucasian) busker down town. He told me of his travels around the world and then he asked me where I was from. I honestly didn't think much of him and told him I was raised here, that I was Canadian. I thought he was nice and so I thought he would be more open minded. And I would like to make a disclaimer. Let's not shit on this dude as a racist. He wasn't mean. I know he had no ill intentions. But he was ignorant. He seemed to miss the part about me being Canadian and kept going on about how he went to China and how he loved 'my culture'. I get it, we all come from some where, except maybe the aboriginals. And yes, I'm Asian, yes, I still carry cultures of my parents. Anyways, I shrugged and went along with it. Even though I don't really relate to what he was saying, in a way, I did. But only the superficial things.
But somewhere down our conversation, he realized I was born in Hong Kong. ""Well, why didn't you say so?"" he asked. ""Hong Kong is vastly different from China."" I shrugged. After that, we talked about other things. Wasn't much conflict.
Anyways, although this story doesn't have much conflict, it made me realize that there is so much conflict. To white people, and yes, even racist people, like actual racist people, I am no different than the mainland Chinese. This isn't a 'let us Asians band together and fight white people', this is a call to say that that we shouldn't let differences divide us. Why can't we focus on similarities? It's sad that Hong Kong people are fighting with mainlanders here because of recent events. Because, the shitty thing about the interaction with the white guy is, I realize we people have so much of this us vs them mentality. There are white people who hate me because if I look different and assume I speak Cantonese. And yet, Hong Konger's hate me because I can't speak Cantonese properly. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
As a child, I had mainlander friends, I even had Taiwanese friends. I saw no difference. In fact, like the white guy, I legitimately thought we were all 'Chinese'. If you want to acknowledge your heritage, good for you. But I'm no different than they any more than a Beijinger is different from some rural mainlander. We all grew up and shared each other's dim sum. We all went to watch hockey at each other's house. And you know what? I'm not a traitor to my kind. My home is here. Forgive me if I don't give a shit about dividing people. There are so many kind people in and out of Hong Kong. I am one of those poorer people. Communist or hong kong government, none of them has given to shits about people like me. So people be acting like how great the 'democratic' hong kong is, well, respectfully, I disagree.
I have no dog in this fight, and maybe that's why I think both sides are both right and wrong.

This happened a while ago, and initially I thought it didn't matter, but I think with recent events, it is more relevant than ever. And sorry if it's long.
I was talking to a (Caucasian) busker down town. He told me of his travels around the world and then he asked me where I was from. I honestly didn't think much of him and told him I was raised here, that I was Canadian. I thought he was nice and so I thought he would be more open minded. And I would like to make a disclaimer. Let's not shit on this dude as a racist. He wasn't mean. I know he had no ill intentions. But he was ignorant. He seemed to miss the part about me being Canadian and kept going on about how he went to China and how he loved 'my culture'. I get it, we all come from some where, except maybe the aboriginals. And yes, I'm Asian, yes, I still carry cultures of my parents. Anyways, I shrugged and went along with it. Even though I don't really relate to what he was saying, in a way, I did. But only the superficial things.
But somewhere down our conversation, he realized I was born in Hong Kong. ""Well, why didn't you say so?"" he asked. ""Hong Kong is vastly different from China."" I shrugged. After that, we talked about other things. Wasn't much conflict.
Anyways, although this story doesn't have much conflict, it made me realize that there is so much conflict. To white people, and yes, even racist people, like actual racist people, I am no different than the mainland Chinese. This isn't a 'let us Asians band together and fight white people', this is a call to say that that we shouldn't let differences divide us. Why can't we focus on similarities? It's sad that Hong Kong people are fighting with mainlanders here because of recent events. Because, the shitty thing about the interaction with the white guy is, I realize we people have so much of this us vs them mentality. There are white people who hate me because if I look different and assume I speak Cantonese. And yet, Hong Konger's hate me because I can't speak Cantonese properly. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
As a child, I had mainlander friends, I even had Taiwanese friends. I saw no difference. In fact, like the white guy, I legitimately thought we were all 'Chinese'. If you want to acknowledge your heritage, good for you. But I'm no different than they any more than a Beijinger is different from some rural mainlander. We all grew up and shared each other's dim sum. We all went to watch hockey at each other's house. And you know what? I'm not a traitor to my kind. My home is here. Forgive me if I don't give a shit about dividing people. There are so many kind people in and out of Hong Kong. I am one of those poorer people. Communist or hong kong government, none of them has given to shits about people like me. So people be acting like how great the 'democratic' hong kong is, well, respectfully, I disagree.
I have no dog in this fight, and maybe that's why I think both sides are both right and wrong. Just because you identify as hong kong, that doesn't mean people doing it are in the right because they are on 'your side'. and vice versa. Do I trust the extradition will not be abused? Of course not. But I also don't want my birth city to harbour fugitives. Gang is rampant in Hong Kong.

I can never imagine that the protest in HK has impacted emotionally this much. It is so sad to see that HK people have to fight this hard for justice and rule of law. It is even sadder to see how this protest has divided HK people from many people from Mainland China. Few weeks ago, a random SFU girl from Mainland China has contacted me on facebook, asking me to join their protest against HK students in Vancouver. Perhaps, she can see that I am from the Mainland from my last name and automatically assume that I will be against the protest in HK. I talked to her for a bit; some of her thoughts are quite violent and aggressive. The whole incidence is beyond me. Later I learned that these students even have organized groups on WeChat. Talking about WeChat, all the news on WeChat about HK protest is extremely biased and my relatives in China only believe those news. I can’t really explain to them the reality in HK because I am afraid that my chat is monitored by the Chinese government. It is very frustrating.
For all the students from Mainland China, please try to read news from different sources. It is ok to have different opinions but try express your opinions in a respectful way. I hope we can all calm down and have some meaningful conversations.
And for all the students for HK, there are still many mainland Chinese people who support the HK protest. Some of us may be afraid to express our support openly because of the government censorship but we support you in your heart.","#11952

So I’m back home for summer break. I identify as mostly homosexual, and while I don’t keep it a secret from others, I’m not openly out to most people. Now, my country is not exactly homophobic but the heteronormativity is pretty strong here and some of the conversations I have here really make me miss Vancouver and its queer-friendly culture. It’s like people over here don’t even consider the possibility of you not being straight unless you’re very Camp Gay.
For example, me and my older coworker were talking about children.
Me: No, I really don’t want children.
Coworker: I didn’t want children at your age either. Sometimes you change your mind, sometimes it just happens…
Me: (getting as close as possible hinting at my sexuality without outing myself in a casual conversation with a person who barely knows me) Uhuh, no, I’m pretty sure that can’t happen to me.

Before you know it, you'll find yourself trying to seduce someone with the best Sauder snake email writing skills you have.This is why I am so grateful for UBCC honestly I have no idea how I could get this off my chest otherwise.",,1563051180,,,134,67,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2553893714628906&id=1287650764586547,

I am a lesbian and my closest friends (who are all female) have no idea. There are a number of reasons why I have decided to remain in the closet. Firstly, while I don't think any of them are particularly homophobic, there is a part of me that is certain that once I tell them, things will get subtly awkward between us (i.e conscious hugging). Secondly, I have gotten so good at acting straight that I even got into the habit of checking out random guys in front of them. Sometimes it gets to the point where I am fake drooling over a guy so hard that they have to snap me out of it. The other day I even followed a ""cute"" guy in IKB to overcompensate. Lastly, its so easy to check out girls in public when you're not out. No friend would tease a straight-looking closeted girl for staring and complimenting other girls.

Clenching my fists a tear rolls down my cheek, I try hard to keep myself together but I can’t help burst into more tears. Don’t get me wrong I’m not ungrateful for anything in life, I want to succeed and work hard and make use of the opportunity I’ve to study at ubc. But it just gets so hard sometimes. More than sometimes now. I’ve made such good friends so far and had the most fun times but those waves of sadness, stress, discomfort just seem to make life seem not worth it. It was never this bad during IB, but now no matter how hard I try my efforts are never enough, something always goes wrong. Being a guy from an Asian family the pressure is insane, now I’m not saying this applies to everyone cause I’ve Asian friends who’s parents are so chill. But on my case it has come to the point where I don’t have mild anxiety it’s gotten way worse, I despise being home over the break and the smallest judgement or criticism makes me so sensitive. There is financial pressure, pressure of not getting into my major, pressure of failing courses and having to hear my parents criticize me for it for years to come.
Before exams I get so stressed not because I’m not prepared for the exam but because I’m scared I won’t be able to please my parents. The anxiety makes it difficult for me to breath, I clench my fists so hard that my nails leave scars on my palm. It’s a very dark place that makes you feel like you’ll never be good enough for anything. I am always the one to apologize first in fights with friends because they’re the ones who don’t judge me and I don’t want to lose them, they’re more of a family to me than my parents. There are so many secrets I keep due to the fear of my family disapproving my choices, this comes from past experiences of them doing so. My choices aren’t necessarily wrong, it’s a difference in mindset but putting another person in a situation where they stick to their choice or live with guilt for the rest of their life is absolutely disgusting. I want to get out of this. I moved out of Honk Kong so I would be away from home, but seems like the home will never get away from me or I guess the criticism won’t get away. I’m not giving up on life itself yet, but slowly learning to accept the way it is. Standing up for myself never worked so I guess it’s time to back off and quietly tolerate the pressure till I’m at my max breaking point and finally give up on life.","TW: suicide, mental health, family problems

But on my case it has come to the point where I don’t have mild anxiety it’s gotten way worse, I despise being home over the break and the smallest judgement or criticism makes me so sensitive. There is financial pressure, pressure of not getting into my major, pressure of failing courses and having to hear my parents criticize me for it for years to come.
Before exams I get so stressed not because I’m not prepared for the exam but because I’m scared I won’t be able to please my parents. The anxiety makes it difficult for me to breath, I clench my fists so hard that my nails leave scars on my palm. It’s a very dark place that makes you feel like you’ll never be good enough for anything. I am always the one to apologize first in fights with friends because they’re the ones who don’t judge me and I don’t want to lose them, they’re more of a family to me than my parents. There are so many secrets I keep due to the fear of my family disapproving my choices, this comes from past experiences of them doing so. My choices aren’t necessarily wrong, it’s a difference in mindset but putting another person in a situation where they stick to their choice or live with guilt for the rest of their life is absolutely disgusting. I want to get out of this. I moved out of Honk Kong so I would be away from home, but seems like the home will never get away from me or I guess the criticism won’t get away. I’m not giving up on life itself yet, but slowly learning to accept the way it is. Standing up for myself never worked so I guess it’s time to back off and quietly tolerate the pressure till I’m at my max breaking point and finally give up on life.",,1560296460,,,20,11,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2497188986966046&id=1287650764586547,

Hello guys! I am a student from University Hill Secondary school just south of the campus. I would just like to take this time to make a confession about UBC. I’m not a UBC student, but I have been freeloading and leeching off of UBC facilities since 2014. Using the spaces to study, libraries to read books without borrowing them, and free internet to prep AP, I thought I could be a parasite forever. But, all good things come to an end. I’m graduating high school, and UBC got the last laugh as my tuition fees are used to develop drugs that cure parasitic infections. I cannot be a parasite for much longer... I will miss these days. Sigh....","#11837

I would like to share a story with you. It is a story that is close to my heart, so I beg you for some patience and some sympathy.
I went to a party, and the host owned a cat. The cat was very beautiful, as many cats are. As we lounged in his living room, I commented on the pet and asked if it was usually amenable to physical touch from people. The host replied, “Yes”, and followed with, almost as an afterthought, deadpan with mirth tickling the corners of his eyes, “but be careful – he doesn’t like immigrants”. Laughter flitted across the group, and across my face as well. I reached to pet it, armed with the notion that this pet would be comfortable in my presence – born roughly two decades ago at Royal Columbian Hospital during a particularly bitter winter, never living more than thirty minutes from the place where I arrived on this bright earth, screaming and kicking, to a mother of one and eventually more. And yet, as my hand neared him, in search of the particular brand of apathetic affection that only he can supply, he reared his head and hissed at my offering.
“See? I told you – he doesn’t like immigrants”. Laughter bubbled into the air.
In my naivety, I explained “But I was born here.”
A voice full with laughter, from a white-passing immigrant who moved here when they were young explained, “Yah, but you don’t look it”. I laughed reflexively. It was a harmless enough statement said in ignorance, with no malevolence in its intent. Yet I found those five words resonated within me, tapping on a dormant part of myself that had been buffeted and sheltered. They sat uncomfortably in the back of my skull, pressing, stubborn, refusing to let me enjoy the remainder of this evening. And so I spent the night feeling slightly ajar, failing miserably to keep some vague crushing emotion at bay. It is only later on, when I look back on this instance can I identify what I was so desperately hiding from. I had felt abandoned.
I have known nothing else but this great city in this great country. I am homegrown, born and raised, filled with pride to call myself Canadian; my childhood, my teens, my young adult years, all spent within the borders of this land. I have always called this place my home, but only after that night did I start to see my position as a guest. A borrower. I am viewed as temporary, only here for now, for a little bit, just a while, until I go back. To where, I ask. Because I have only known this. I had believed, by virtue of being born to parents who are citizens of this nation, that I would be accepted as a member of this sovereignty, fully and wholly with open arms and wide smiles. But will that time ever come? Or is it something I must earn, despite having already fulfilled the very requirements that would be sufficient for my neighbours to be deemed worthy of welcome.
The hospital of my birth, the preschool I took my first steps in, the mall I got my first job at, where I graduated high school, all the milestones, evidence of my life lived, are details forgotten, unimportant, a footnote. The genetics that coloured my hair, that carved out my bone structure, that flattened my nose and painted my golden skin, the features lovingly handed down from generations by my ancestors and carefully crafted in the womb of my mother will always stand between me and my citizenry. I exist in this limbo, severed from my ethnic roots while rejected from my home – never fully accepted by either countries I could possibly tether to. A foreigner, in its purest. Adrift across this globe in desperate search of a sanctuary where I feel safe. Loved. And can finally rest.
That very same night, I watched as my friend, the white-passing immigrant who moved here when they were young, held a purring, content, furball in her lap, blind to the implications of its acceptance. And I couldn’t help the shame that settled heavy in the pit of my stomach as it ebbed and flowed and swelled until I felt it knocking on the base of my throat, in the corners of my eyes, threatening to spill out into the world. I remember chastising myself, wondering why I was so moved by this rejection. The wisdom of retrospection told me I was just coming to terms with rejection from something else – something I would never forget, something I would always hold dear, close to my heart, and I beg you for some patience and some sympathy.","#11834

I never really questioned why I wasn’t putting myself out there, just figured I didn’t have enough time or wasn’t really interested in a relationship at this point in my life. A few weeks ago a thought creeped into my head that I might actually be lesbian (never really considered it before). It kind of makes sense retrospectively.

Mmnalright. So this is how I ended up giving a homeless guy a ride to a prostitute. Now you’re probably wondering, how did I get myself in this predicament?
So last week, my girlfriend and I went out to her parents place in Burnaby and while driving back to campus we went through Hastings for some reason. And it was late and we saw this hobo with a walker shuffle by. Normally, I can stifle guilt by girl was with me and she gives me the “uh are you really that big of a piece of shit?” look and so we pick him up.
He asks us to take down Carrall street which is “where my girl lives” as he put it, going on to add “I wanna get some booty!”. Btw if your looking for whores and smack, Carrall is where ya go. It’s the fucking Disneyland of whores and smack. So this guy introduced himself as “Jon with no H”, and I introduced myself as Tyler (not my real name). So at this point, I’m pissed cuz it’s way more than I bargained for, I just wanted to be a good guy and now I gotta get a hobo some ass. Delicious.
Then he asks if we can grab a bite. So we pull into McD and he orders $25 worth of food, which I HAD TO FUCKING PAY FOR because I was scared he may hurt me, or worse, my girlfriend, because he kinda looked like he was a guy with nothing to lose you know what I mean?
After which, he plops back into the car and Jon has the audacity to ask for more money, and I fucking lie and say I don’t carry cash and he says “there’s an ATM over there!”. Right at this point, we kick him, his shitty walker, and his smorgasbord of food out and go home with my lady. And she agreed that it was a bad idea and we get home and fuck.
And then it turns out I ended up with a big mite infestation in my car. So that’s lovely. Moral is, stay the fuck away from Hastings.","#11821

As I see a lot of my friends graduating, and a lot of their families coming to be a part of it, I begin to get worried. Next year, that'll be me, and lots of my family will be coming to attend. It's not that I don't want my family to come here; I just worry that the secrets I've been keeping from them—that I've been having sex, drinking occasionally, not keeping up with religion—will find their way to the surface. I'm not ready for that.
I went away for school for a reason. I could've stayed closer to home, but I wanted to be able to live without my actions being scrutinized. ""Why were you out late?"" ""Do I smell booze on your breath?"" ""Aren't you supposed to be studying?"" ""Why are you working so many shifts?"" The list goes on, and on, and on. I didn't want that to be part of my reality, and I'm grateful to've had the resources to prevent that.
But... what if something slips out? What if, when meeting a friend of mine, they mention my ex? My parents don't even know that I've dated, much less that I've had a long-term relationship, or that I've been sexually active.
If this is your reality right now, I feel for you. I wish you the best of luck. You are an adult, and privacy is a privilege of adulthood. Your family doesn't have a right to know your secrets. Take comfort in that.
If you have a friend or roommate whose family is conservative, and you know that you'll be meeting their parents or whatever, ask what topics are off limits. This is especially true for LGBT+ that haven't come out to their parents, people with substance abuse problems (or even those who use recreational drugs responsibly), and people whose parents are super religious.
If you're their friend, it's not necessarily your job to protect them. But, if you're an actual friend to them, you'll appreciate that their privacy is important. Be supportive. I know you can do it.","#11820

I saw someone post about increasing the prices of grad tixs from $2 --> $9. This is my response to it.
Personally, I do not see anything wrong with selling grad tixs for $90+. Face value is $2 apparently. When there is so much demand, why can't I exploit the people who desperately need it? This world is cruel- trust no one. I will not be afraid to exploit anyone for the sake of my loved ones. This world is HARSH and one must do whatever they can to support themselves and who they love. What I learned is that being soft means you will be eaten up. As a person, I will do anything in my powers to ensure the people who matter to me are taken care of.
Selling grad tixs for $90+ is absolutely okay. Do I care its for celebration for our successes and efforts. Absolutely NOT. Now is the perfect time to take advantage of the weak.
Try your best to not show weakness else others will bite you on it.","#11817

I was TAing this one class with a pretty harsh curve. I was told that I had to stand my ground when grading and not to waver when students inevitably ask for higher marks. So I graded one students paper who wasn't fulfilling all the criteria (albeit there wasn't much of a rubric). They had messaged me and were practically guilt tripping me to give them a higher mark. Saying stuff like having an extremely high average and if they even get a *slightly* lower mark that they couldn't get into their graduate program. After I had declined and told them to talk to the Prof they messaged me again implying a trade of sorts. They had basically told me they would give me n00ds in exchange for a higher mark. I won't tell you if I accepted or not but they did get in the top percentile of the class.","#11813

TLDR: I almost drunkenly puked my guts out all over Gateman.
In first term I showed up to ECON 101 with gateman absolutely hammered, he totally knew and was having an issue with his microphone and called me up to help him fix it (to be fair it was a 4pm lecture on a Friday and I was going to a party after, I shouldn’t have even attempted to go to class, nobody should do this, my judgement was heavily impaired and I did it for shits and giggles). I proceeded to clumsily dial the tech support number as he watched me with a shit-eating grin on his face. I went back to my seat and was lapsing in and out of consciousness for the entire lecture.
My drunk ass then decided it would be a good idea to go ask him a question during his “mobile office hours” after class. Not 15 seconds after speaking to him (I think he was just humouring me) I opened the fire exit that lead outside and proceeded to puke my guts out. I stumbled on to a bus home, showered, and somehow made it out that night.
It was both a humours and absolutely mortifying experience. Don’t pre-game and then go to class kids.","#11810

I had the worst flight today. I wanted to use the lavatory but guess who sat at the aisle seat? My mean strict dick professor that I was scarred of asking for him to give way for me to leave because he’s such a mean and scary person and gets annoyed really easily even when you ask questions. So I figured I would go when he goes especially since he drank a glass of beer. But NO. He didn’t get up to go once for our flight to Japan that I held my pee in from Alaska (I had to go around mid flight after a tasty lunch with beer) to Tokyo that I stopped drinking water and FREE booze (Asian carriers have such nice drinks) for the rest of the flight. Worst of all he kinda knows me because he got mad at me asking for extra office hours and gave me weird looks when I kept moving my legs due to my bursting bladder. You could tell he was annoyed at me even just sitting there fiddling never mind asking him to move so I can go pee. Lessons learned :1) never choose a window seat unless you want to hold your pee and 2) never sit next to a professor","#11809

So I am born in Canada and do not look my ethnicity at all. I am constantly mistaken for being ""white"" or mixed, but I'm far from it. As a result, I have never experienced discrimination based off my ethnicity before. That was until now. I was on the phone with a government service attempting to figure out some miscommunications. My full name is very ethnic and over the phone the lady was already being quite rude but asked me ""well how long have you been in Canada for?"". I was taken aback and didn't understand what she meant at first. What did that have to do with explaining a simple mix up? I asked her ""what do you mean?"" and she just said ""Maybe you don't understand how this works. When did you come here?"". I understand this isn't necessarily a rude question, but for her to assume that just because I have a different sounding name I must not be from here really threw me off guard. I was very offended. When I told my friends they just said ""you're lucky you look white"". I just want to apologize to anyone who has ever experienced discrimination of any kind. I know this isn't a big deal but for me it was. I was shocked and embarrassed. It also really opened my eyes to how some people are treated just based off appearance. No one chooses to look the way they do. No one deserves to be treated any differently based off their appearance or background. All this from a simple phone call. I hate the realization that people experience much worse in person. I'm sorry.","#11802

I loved Xi so much, I had a top score on Study the Great Nation and had conducted human flesh searches on dozens of toad fans.
I'd pray to Xi every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given.
""Xi is love"", I would say, ""Xi is life"". My dad hears me and calls me a foolish bitch. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Xi. I called him a grass mud horse. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep.
I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me.
It's Xi. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, ""This is my South China Sea"".
He grabs me with his powerful honey-covered hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Xi. He whips my one road with his one belt. It hurts so much, but I do it for Xi.
I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Xi. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love.
My dad walks in. Xi looks him straight in the eye, and says, ""very erotic very violent"", so Xi quickly leaves through my window.

Finding the right person, that perfect person. Like most of you, its something I'd been looking for, and only recently did I finally realize how much that ideal is actually hurting my chances of finding a good relationship.
Almost 2 years ago, I made the leap to go out to talk to more people and expand my social circle. After a year, I felt empowered - I'd talked to enough people to be able to quickly tell whether someone has that ""resonance"" with me, that feeling of you and I would get along as good friends. I started using that as a criteria of whether I'd date someone, I mean, it makes sense, to find that person who's right for you, that they'd be someone who'd resonate with you really quick.
And wow, things sucked afterwards. I was mostly unimpressed by pretty much everyone. It took a few weeks of thinking back before I realized, actually, alot of my good friends, and pretty much everyone I've had closer relationships with (both romantic and none romantic), we never really resonated or even found common ground very quickly. It was always through the slow process, of seeing each other once every few days in class or in the labs, slowly getting to know each other, and for their well being to mean more then a random stranger, that the relationship formed. Now that I look back at it, this ideal of ""finding the perfect person"" seems like a complete arbitrary requirement that has been preventing me from actually finding a good relationship in the last 2 years, and now I really wish I had those 2 years back to do things differently.","#11799

As a female in STEM, I have many burdens. Many of those burdens are inherent to the politics of operating within a climate that doesn’t always make me feel welcome. I’ve spent a lot of energy learning about the injustices that I experience (and will experience) daily in my education and career, and that includes re-learning what it means to love myself as a female. Spending extensive time within/around many males who harbored less than favorable views on women gave me a warped outlook on feminine things – I spent a long time believing that “girly” was synonymous with “stupid”, “dumb”, and “airheaded”. That liking “feminine” things and enjoying academically rigorous subjects were somehow mutually exclusive. I’ve met a lot of girls who thought the same, and I understand where they come from. It’s isolating and exhausting working in a space where you feel like you don’t belong, where you have to prove yourself over and over to colleagues, supervisors, underlings that yes, I belong here, and yes, I deserve to be here. These associations between intelligence and womanhood permeate throughout everything and in order to overcome even a fraction of these preconceived notions, I (and many others) chose, whether consciously or subconsciously, to disassociate ourselves from these characteristics. To sever our ties to traditionally girly things to get our foot in the door, to be taken a little more seriously, to be just a little more accepted. Until now, I’ve accepted this as a fact, albeit sadly, and it has been no problem. I am in no position to coach my fellow women on how they should express their own femininity, and by extension, many of these wonderful women are no less of a woman for choosing to do so.
Honestly, there are bigger things to complain about when you’re in my position, but since I’m dramatic and needy I’m choosing to rant about this, here. You see, over the past couple years I’ve grown to really love traditionally feminine things. I love planning outfits, doing my make-up, and painting my nails. I’ll clothes shop as stress relief (arguably, this creates more stress down the road but I’m not the best financial planner). I have more lipsticks than I will ever need and I don’t remember the last time I could actually close my drawers without having to shove them from the excess spillage. I’ve been seriously debating dropping 700$ on a pair of really cute boots I saw online, just because they’re really, really, pretty. I adore sparkly jewelry and gushing over boys; my drink at starbucks is fifty miles long and my favourite drink at any bar is even longer. The list goes on, but it’s all the same: I love being girly.
What I don’t love is how lonely that can get. Because many of my female friends are members of the industry, close to all of them have no interest/actively shun the idea of participating in these activities. Whether it is because they refuse to be slotted into a category they’ve heard be berated and degraded by their fellow co-workers time and time again or because they reject traditional femininity as part of some quasi-enlightenment crusade (newsflash: there is no one right way to be a woman, and no one expression of that is better than any other), I’ve found that whenever I speak about a topic even tangentially related to traditionally-girly things I get some snide remark about how they “don’t do that kind of stuff”. Great. Awesome. That’s fine. The rude, judge-y tone? Not fine. Look, I just want someone who can shop for make-up and bras with me in-between panel discussions at ISAR, someone I can get manicures with while we gossip about the asshole who keeps cutting in line for the flow cytometer, or someone to binge-watch The Bachelor episodes with as a de-stressor after 14 straight hours in the lab because my control group started to show something funky in every replicate, is that so much to ask?
There is no shame in loving girly things. They don’t make you any less of a nerd in your field. It doesn’t make you any less credible or deserving or hard-working. It does, however, mean that every now and then you regret choosing to wear heels that one day but only god knows why your gel looks Like That and you are a triple AAA premium Fool for thinking it was going to be a short day but damn if these shoes don’t make your outfit bangin’ and your ass POP. So girls, specifically girls in STEM, I love y’all. Seriously, I do. But could this disdainful aura that exists around girly things please dissipate? Maybe we could all channel this energy into karmic revenge on those who cut in line for lab equipment, because I’m about to chokehold slam the next person who does. Thank you for listening!","#11798

So I'm switching majors. I'm the type of person that has to have plans A through Z when it comes to my direction in life, but I haven't been listening to myself. So I'm switching from Computer Science to History and for the first time in months I can breathe. The enormous sand bag of stress that was sitting on my chest is gone, and I finally don't feel inadequate anymore. Mind you, I was doing well in Computer Science, a 76 average is certainly not cause for concern, but I haven't been honest with myself. This last semester I've worked incredibly hard, harder than I have in any other semester before, and my grades dropped my average by 3% and I came to hate what I study. I've been stuck on my plan A - working in software where there are many job opportunities, and I've come to realize that life isn't about following everything according to plan, it's about being able to pivot.
After thinking about it for a few years and wrestling with myself over it, I've decided to try to get into law school to become a lawyer, and I would love nothing more to study history on my way there, no matter how much I've denied my love for the subject and passed it off as inferior in my mind. There is the possibility that I won't get into law school, and then I'll have a degree in something that's hard to make a career out of, but I'll figure it out. Maybe I'll come back and do a graduate degree, maybe I won't.
I've been extremely fortunate to have parents that are supportive. My dad isn't the most outwardly affectionate person, a fairly serious guy with a degree in sciences who heavily advocates for an education in science, but my parents were behind me completely. It was a moving moment for me, as someone who has always tried to make my parents proud, it turns out the only one with extremely high expectations was me.
So take it from me, don't be so hard on yourself. You can't change who you are, and don't feel inferior for following a path that suits your talents. I promise you'll feel better in the end.","#11792

This last semester I've worked incredibly hard, harder than I have in any other semester before, and my grades dropped my average by 3% and I came to hate what I study. I've been stuck on my plan A - working in software where there are many job opportunities, and I've come to realize that life isn't about following everything according to plan, it's about being able to pivot.
After thinking about it for a few years and wrestling with myself over it, I've decided to try to get into law school to become a lawyer, and I would love nothing more to study history on my way there, no matter how much I've denied my love for the subject and passed it off as inferior in my mind. There is the possibility that I won't get into law school, and then I'll have a degree in something that's hard to make a career out of, but I'll figure it out. Maybe I'll come back and do a graduate degree, maybe I won't.
I've been extremely fortunate to have parents that are supportive. My dad isn't the most outwardly affectionate person, a fairly serious guy with a degree in sciences who heavily advocates for an education in science, but my parents were behind me completely. It was a moving moment for me, as someone who has always tried to make my parents proud, it turns out the only one with extremely high expectations was me.
So take it from me, don't be so hard on yourself. You can't change who you are, and don't feel inferior for following a path that suits your talents. I promise you'll feel better in the end.",,1558020900,,,272,24,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2450212024997076&id=1287650764586547,

Here is the tale of how a 16 year old girl tried to fuck me.
I skateboard. Well. I go to the skatepark on campus and shred some salad grinds, nosepicks and the occasional kick flip. I was learning how to do a darkslide (where you flip your deck such that you’re now sliding grip tape side down vs board belly side down) and a pack of high school looking chicks come in.
As a street skater, I can only admire vert skateboarders but these girls could shred the ramps. I was impressed but I kept doing what I was doing. Then, one of them came over and introduced herself as <CENSORED_FOR_PRIVACY> and she asked me to teach her how to crooked grind (get your head out of the gutter) and so I did.
About a month goes by and we all know each other. The one who first approached me kinda became a friend to me cuz I thought she was cool to chill in a skatepark with. One day she invited me over cuz she lives on campus.
I say OK cuz I thought we were just gonna hang, maybe play a video game (we’re both gamers) and that’s it. But when I stepped away to use the loo, I returned to her being butt nude and she said “well?”. So I did what came naturally.
I screamed because I had no inclination to fuck a minor and ran out screaming “you’re 5 years younger than me!! what’s wrong with you??”
I am now looking for a new park. But did this make me a pedophile?","TW: pedophilia

I was hosting a house party and the first person to show up was some super fucking hot blonde chick, but we started talking as if we've been friends for a long time. For some reason she showed up early morning so I'm like ""ok one sec I need to shower"". So I got to my washroom to shower and as I close the door, she turns the lights off and joins the washroom, takes off her shirt and we start making out and I play with the titties as one does.
While this is happening, I hear the doorbell ring, so I have to answer right away. People start coming in and I'm like ""shit, I missed my shot"". Once people start eating/drinking at the party, this chick pulls me into the washroom again, and she's like ""give me your hand"". So I do it. She moves my hand through her hair, across her body, and to her crotch.
She says ""Do you feel that?"" It was at this moment I was like ""OH FUCK YOU HAVE A PENIS"" and in the background I hear everyone scream ""HAPPY NEW YEAR"" and then I woke up.

So I came out to my dad sometime last year and after a bit of time he seemed to be okay with it. I was pretty worried because his parents are very religious and would in no way accept me if I came out to them - so I was okay with him never mentioning it if it meant he was semi-ok with it. But I just got home and found a Bible in the office with only one section bookmarked with a sticky note - the section about sexual sins. I don't know if I'm reading too much into this or not but now I don't know if he truly accepted my sexuality, or just choose to overlook it because I'm his kid. I don't know how to bring this up to him or any of my friends ...","#11772

Dearest lovers please sit tight,
listen closely, hear my plight,
in couplets a confession told,
misadventure to behold.
This tale starts as many do,
my first girl and my first screw,
around in bed and with her snatch,
the deed to be done, excitement to match.
Not to toot my own horn or blow my own wood,
when it comes to oral pleasure, I'm pretty damn good,
my tongue sings songs echoed only by her moans,
not long till she comes in shudders and groans.
My issue is not in foreplay you see,
but rather once we move onto part B,
the dog in the hot, the ladle in the pot,
the stick in the pink, the plumber and sink.
As you might notice, I quite like wordplay,
I like it a lot - a loose tongue, you might say.
And when it comes to talking quite dirty,
Or to being physically connected yet flirty,
I find it quite hard to resist the temptation,
to quip in iambic, or alliterate my dictation.
See prose don't turn me on half as much,
As a dirty rhyming couplet whilst I fuck her up the butt.
Back to the story, this was my very first,
We nervously laughed; embarrassment almost burst.
In an attempt to lighten the mood,
She quietly mumbled ""yo talk dirty to me dude"".
She obviously must have had no idea,
The damage that would be wrought, and the tears,
That would flow from her face shortly after I stutter:
""Y-y-you nut sucking cum-bucket better fucking enjoy being filled the fuck up by my slut-cut nut butter"".
We both froze for a moment, slip out Roger did,
Then cascades of laughter broke through to my id,
Soon after we called it quits for the evening,
Bedmate crying, rolling, in stitches, in a small puddle of semen.
My next bed adventure I'd sworn off the Poe,
Yet just as I'd prepared another condom to go,
My new partner in slime uttered those fateful words:
""Talk dirty my darling, ain't this slut a fine bird?""
""Did the bird ask for permission to squawk?
""I think not, nor should you talk,
""Your hot as an angel with the purest of souls,
""But utter just one more word, and I'll stuff your face hole""
Shock was followed by anger, then amusement,
And yet another partner began to comment,
On just how ridiculous my wordplay does seem,
When she's sitting on five point five inches of peen.
Thus begins the third cautionary tale of mine,
A major in english, a connoisseur of rhyme,
And just as I shove it in her behind,
She moans ""Talk dirty darling, help me unwind.""
""So soft! what light through yonder rectum breaks?
""It is last night's feast, and my manhood is the sun.
""Arise, fair sun, and stab the anticipating wound,
""That be already wet and slobbery with lube,
""That thou her clutch art far more fair than the stink:
""Stick not the pink, since it be loose from misuse;
""Her vaginal livery is but sick and mean
""And none but fools do use it; cordon it off.
""It is my lady, O, it is my slut!
""O, that she knew she were!""
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
As I double back down like the cat in the hat:
""Given the choice of Thing 1 or Thing 2,
""Thing 2 is for me, Thing 1 is for you,
""For I'm sure you will see, with me it is true,
""You can pleasure Thing 1, and I'll stick it to Thing 2.""
Her face now a-glare, my mind in a bind,
I think of one saving throw - splitting the line...
""The flowers a-bloom, thy rectum a-pink,
a little raw from the motion of thy sphinct-
-er rubbing up against my cock.
Oh look, it's slut-o-clock!""
That famed literary trick did that day save my bacon,
Hostility left, replaced by emotion forsaken,
A face of sheer and utter disbelief,
At stupidity unheard of, without recourse or relief.
Alone, in tears, as she walked out on our canoodle,
Just a bit of brown biscuit left on Danger Noodle,
I sobbed as I mopped up the mess we had made,
and swore off rhyming dirty for the rest of my days.
But this be a cycle - the parts number four,
And so I encountered a wonderful whore,
Don't worry, she mind not the use of the word,
In context she calls me much worse than you've heard.
We hit of off great and soon it was time,
She asked for bad words, I suppressed hard my rhyme,
Instead I spurted a weak ""come for me, girl"",
Yet when I heard her response, my heart took a whirl.
""Is that all you've got, you limp water hose?
""Your cum-pipe is weak, like your plain unrhymed prose!
""How's your little Johnson meant to make me let go,
""When my short verbal spar left you out on the road...?""
A feeling of joy swept straight through my nads,
Then I shudder and stutter and mutter ""my bad"",
As I empty my load at the slightest verbal provocation,
Yet never before had I felt such an exquisite sensation.
Not long after, and I went for round two,
This time I knew what I had to do,
And so as she began to moan out as well,
I knew it was the end of my miserable spell...
""Art thou my slut, guzzling my cum?
""Thinking you'd won just because I had come
""Before I had a chance to respond to your flaunt.
""Yet now I shall haunt and now I shall taunt,
""Your sweet little spot, get your hot clot in a knot,
""Till you scream a lot and eventually lose the plot.
""Now you have seen, and now you have heard,
""You may have been a fast bird, but I'll still get the last word""
And so as she howled in exquisite pleasure,
Unable to answer back to such literary treasure,
She curled up in my arms, made me her personal glove,
And for the first time I knew what it must mean to feel love.
Fast forward four years, happily married are we,
Still studying I am, graduated and working hard is she,
And every night when she comes to my bed,
The words fly hot and hard, as we join our hearts and our heads.
I guess the moral of my story is simple my friend:
Whether your fetish be feet, red beet, fingers up your rear-end,
Don't give up, keep searching, for one day you'll find,
That person whom exceeds the limits of even your fucked-up mind.","#11769

I guess the moral of my story is simple my friend:

Hey everyone, please consider what you say to your friends as sometimes it ends up being the last thing you say to them...
My friend was stressing over his finals and marks, and i stupidly told him to shut up, to ""calm the fuck down"" and ""take a chillpill bro"" and just downplayed all his worries just because i thought he was being annoying. I didnt consider how stressed he was at all and now hes not around anymore. How fucking dumb could I be. Dont be a dick to your friends, or to anyone. It should be common sense omfg, i wanna die aha.","#11765

YEAH THAT'S RIGHT GO ON AND JUDGE ME. TELL ME THAT I WON'T MAKE MONEY AND WILL REGRET THE DECISION FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
But seriously, for the entire year I have been plagued with existential dread every 5 hours. These CS assignments and programming in general sucks the life out of me. I don't want to code anything but everyone says I should start a personal project. Why would I voluntarily put myself through that kind of pain? I failed a CS midterm (got 36% when the class average was like 78%. This is the first time that I might actually ""fail"" fail a course.)
I know so many who people want to get into CS and I feel guilty telling them I want to leave. How can I be complaining about something I have that they so desperately want? But it'll be better this way; the department's resources can be used for people who are actually good at/passionate about this stuff.

I don’t understand how people are not talking about how terrible the International Student Advising is run at UBC. Some fun facts:
- There are 16,322 international students at UBC, more than 25% of the entire school population.
- There are two advisors that can give you limited advice before you can talk to a full advisor for … 16,322 people.
- Did I mention that the drop-in hours to talk to a real advisor is from 1pm to 4pm (3hrs) everyday? Typical wait time being 1 hr?
- Last time I talked to an advisor it was 45 minutes long and told me to come back. So in one week (assuming 5 advisors), they can take 100 students per week. They would have to operate more than 3 YEARS straight with no break before they can advice 16,322 students.
- Oh right! They also advise professors who have international students coming in the summer to work in their labs too!
THIS UNIVERSITY DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE IN MORE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS.
UBC, if you want to raise money through international students, that’s fine. But you need to provide better support to the 25% of students who represent your school.
The number of international students has risen from 17% to 25.8% in the past 7 years while the number of advisors has remained relatively stagnant. Please do something.

The stalls including unisex ones can be so gross to touch and the weird semi circle U shape seats on toilet leaving the Center exposed to pee dribble from other men was disgusting. I felt disgusted after seating on one. Then comes taking off your bag and jacket just to pee. It seems like such a hassle to pee for a girl that I feel bad they will never get to enjoy the fast pee of guys and how we don’t need to make bodily contact or take off our jackets. After one day I gave up and only sat down to pee at home and started using the urinal even if it meant creating a mess on the floor.

You in your brown leather shoes, you were standing there like a tiger awaiting his prey. I took the far stall so I wouldn't be next to you and quickly got to business. All the coffee I drank as I studied had given me major shits so once the floodgates had opened they wouldn't easily be closed, even when you started jacking off. I'm not going to ask you why you were jacking off. It's exam season and you're clearly very stressed. What I AM going to ask is why you waited for me to start peeing to do so, and why you didn't take off your incredibly noisy jacket? It sounded like a raincoat or a windbreaker which you would have had no reason to be wearing on such a nice day, and because of the material I could hear every pump of your arm as you relieved yourself to the sound of my piss hitting inside of the toilet. Phantom Jacker, I am not going to judge you for your apparent excrement fetish. However, I am going to ask from the deepest depths of my heart that you keep that shit to yourself and stop using random peoples' for your fapping material. Go on fetlife, you'll find someone just as interesting as you are.","#11720

hey listen up first. So it’s exam season and everyone is moving out and there are barely any people left. Campus feels barren and sad because of finals.
Nothing brings together a community like the joint agony and hate of pulling yourself out of your sleep. Everyone gathered in he commonsblock with their mismatched pyjamas and dead faces. We enjoyed it with live music and cheers.
I’m going to miss you all😍🥰❤️
Loved seeing all of your pained expressions.

How do I turn my white bf into a korean oppa?
So my idea of romantic comes from Kpop. Y'know when a guy taps you on the shoulder and you turn around and accidently touch lips and it's like the cutest moment ever.
Well I've been dating a guy for almost 2 years now and recently while studying for exams I started watching Kpop again and now I can't help but want a Korean oppa. I love my bf, but I wish he would do cute things with me so I told him I wanted him to be more affectionate in an uwu way. He agreed to try, but it's just not natural :(
Can a girl whose successfully made their white bf more oppa pls share some advice.","#11701

tw suicide
Now, I've never had depression, or been diagnosed with any mental health disorder, but I know people who have. And I knew people who ended up taking their own lives because of mental health issues.
Given the alarming amount of posts related to suicide I have been seeing throughout the past couple of years, I thought I would say something. Hopefully this helps even one person here on UBC Confessions...
Throughout a couple of years in high school, I was miserable. My family was dysfunctional (parents fighting very frequently), and on top of this, I was constantly battling both loneliness and academic stress. It got to the point where feeling happy for longer than a couple days would seem strange to me; in my head, I would tell myself that there was no way I could be happy for very long-- that soon I would feel depressed or anxious again. That truly thriving wouldn't be possible. From speaking to friends who have been clinically diagnosed with depression, I know now that I never had it myself. Nonetheless, even I found myself having suicidal thoughts at times-- particularly around exam season.
Then two years ago, a girl that I recognized from my high school took her own life. And just last year, another girl I knew from being in the same club on-campus ended up taking her own life as well. I didn't know either of these girls very well. We probably had never exchanged even a dozen words. But let me tell you, when I received the news on Facebook that yet another person I knew had committed suicide, I completely broke down. For hours and hours, I stayed in my room at home, sobbing and feeling utterly broken. Never in my life had my heart felt so heavy. I couldn't even imagine how the friends and family members of that girl must have felt. It was then that something switched inside me. From then on, I told myself that no matter how difficult life gets, I would never think about taking my own life again.
What I'm trying to say is this: You are loved. A whole lot more than you think. Your very presence on Earth makes a difference in someone else's life-- even a stranger's. I know life may seem really hard right now, but please, take care of yourself, and tell yourself that you can overcome whatever it is that you are dealing with. Everyone goes through battles of their own, but what makes life so beautiful is the journey of overcoming those battles.

tw addiction
I am very much actually addicted to weed. I know people think it's not possible, but it is in a low number of cases. You can also develop a psychological dependency on it. Anytime I have a lot of free time to myself, meaning I'm not running to appointments or meetings of any sort, I start smoking more weed. In the case of finals, when I no longer have classes to go to which fill my weeks and give me purpose, and am instead given loads of time to study, I end up smoking weed. A lot. Instead of studying. It gets to the point where whenever I find myself done with an appointment or meeting I have, and am thinking of what to do next, I just smoke weed. I don't even enjoy it anymore, I just want something to do. If I numb my mind to the world then I don't have to participate in it. I don't have to be active in it. I don't have to make my mark on it. I can just be passive and let it float by me. The problem therefore becomes when I smoke weed as a form of procrastination. I do this continually, and develop a habit of smoking. For example, I've smoked pretty much every day since classes have stopped. During the school term, I was actually doing much better: I smoked once a week, if that, and had a general purpose in life. But I've fallen back into my pit of despair again. Continual use of weed fucks your brain up: it affects your memory, retention, attention span, and motivation levels. So even when I'm NOT high, I can't really remember things, focus on things, or be motivated enough to do them. So I've really fucked myself over. I have a memorization-heavy final in two hours, and I've fucked my brain up so much that I haven't studied at all and am now trying desperately to cram knowledge into my head, but it's not fucking working. And I feel like a fat useless stoner piece of shit who deserves to fail. I haven't been working out this term, I've been eating too many donuts, I've been slacking off. I really need to get my shit together. Maybe failing this final will be my wake up call.","#11693

Tw rape
Just a preface this is the story of how I got raped by my girlfriend. It's detailed and Im sorry mods
I had just come home from having two finals in a day and was fucking exhausted. My girlfriend had promised to come over with dinner to cheer me up. We had talked about fucking because she had just come off her period and she doesn't have another exam until the last day and my last one I am fully prepared for.
But I was too tired and exhausted and was just gonna pass out on the couch afterwards while we both watched the new episode of GoT. So we had dinner and she and I shared a bottle and half of wine.
I passed out during the episode, and that's when I woke up to her pulling my sweat pants off and jerking my dick really hard. I was still drunk and I tried to stop her but she amped it up and gave me head. I tried to push her hand off but she just put her hand over my mouth and kept giving. I was too tired and drunk to fight so I just let it happen until I came. I thought we would be done
But then she climbed on top of me and I remember her telling me we were fucking and she ""didn't care I was tired, I'm her boyfriend.""
This was super uncomfortable cuz I was still sensitive from the exhaustion, wine and orgasm but everytime I tried to say something she kissed me and then shut up.
I don't know how long this happened but she was super horny and I just remember waking up at around 3pm when I fell asleep around 10pm/woke up to her giving me head.
So yeah, thanks for that. I've been a bit shaken up but she kepts texting me how awesome I was and how she wished she could take control in the bedroom some more. I'm scared to go to my own bed now and I'm afraid to go the police cuz my dna is in her...help","#11691

Okay, call me crazy, but maybe some amount of theft isn't the worst thing. I know, but hear me out. I'm currently on exchange at another institution which requires your student card to get into and out of the library, so only students ever occupy it. Perhaps partially as a result, theft seems non-existent, people leave their laptops on their desks while they go to the washroom, phones on chairs, full purses and bags, everything. Seems great, right? Well. Right now I am currently sitting at one of the limited number of desks. There is a backpack on the chair at the desk next to me that has been unattended to for TWO HOURS. I watch people walk by, hopeful to find a study space (happy finals szn), and no. A bag. No owner using the place to study. Just selfishly claiming it for themselves, without actually making use of it. If people actually had to worry and care about their stuff, this maybe wouldn't happen as much here, because we all know how much it sucks when you can't find a study space.","#11682

After dinner, we were all in the living room and he asked to see some of my projects and I excitedly agreed, making the biggest mistake of my life of opening my laptop and showing him. My girlfriend and I had recently recorded a video of us getting steamy and I had opened it this morning... and left it open.

tw rape, suicide
Hey guys. I thought this place would probably be the best to post this.
About a week before exams started, I took the bus back home. At the time, everything seemed normal, as it's something I usually did. As I got to a more secluded part near my apartment, a big, muscular guy grabbed me from behind and whisked me to a nearby alleyway, covering my mouth to muffle my screams. He began to fondle my breasts and crotch, and his penis was rubbing up my ass as he was doing this. After what felt like an eternity, he finished and dropped me down, running off. I proceeded to just lay there for about an hour sobbing my eyes out until I decided to head back to my apartment.
I've been really scared to talk to anyone about this, the event that happened has really scarred me and I don't know what to do. I haven't gone to class since the event as I'm nervous of having to encounter him again and a similar scene occurring. I've gotten about ten calls from my parents each day and multiple texts from close friends, all of whom I've ghosted. I'm too scared to talk to anybody. I've even started cutting myself just so I can think of something else. Thoughts about murder and suicide go through my head a lot more now.
Typing all of this took about two hours while having to go through the whole ordeal again in detail and just sitting down crying. I'm more so glad that I've been able to type this all out, though what has happened won't ever be erased. All I want is to not deal with this pain anymore.","#11666

My parents are away for 2 months so my mom told me to take care of the plants (we have random pots around the house that I never really pay attention to). She cares about them a lot so I made sure to water them every week or so.
While I was watering one of them, I noticed some part of the leaves were white and I was worried it was dying (mom will whip my ass).
Turned out that it was okay because it was actually never alive to begin with.. I'VE BEEN WATERING A FAKE PLANT FOR WEEKS. Told my mom what happened and now she's very disappointed at me. ;(","#11665

cw: suicide
drinking is fine but don’t do what i did and have it eventually turn into a solo hobby that only jet fuelled my depression. i get drinking culture but i fucking hate it when people shame others for not drinking or try and normalize drinking ourselves to a stupor.
anyone who jokes about alcoholism clearly didn’t grow up with an alcoholic or suffered from it themselves.
this shit fucking kills people. alcoholism has a death toll and y’all throw that word around like it’s a brag. your friend group may find it hilarious but there’s at least one person out there who hears your jokes every time and it isn’t funny to them at all.
eventually it got to when i downed a shit ton of whiskey and tried to kill myself in a drunken and super depressed stupor. my friends didn’t even suspect anything was wrong because i was known as (to them, as a joke) “that alcoholic” in the friend group. that was when i knew i needed help but i should’ve realized it MONTHS before that point. don’t get to that point.

Okay, so here's the thing, I can't study at home. I just CANNOT. I live a 90 minute commute away from campus and I study best when I am at UBC studying and I am productive there.
""Why don't you just go study there then?""
Well, that's the problem. It's not the commute that's the problem though. I'm 19, and my asian parents are controlling af. They think I'm going to the library to meet with ""boys"" and get pregnant, or get wasted. Like, ""DURING FINALS?!?! ARE YOU KIDDING?"" So I'm stuck at home, with a final tomorrow that I haven't prepared for and just thinking I may as well end my life.
""Just because you can't study at home?""
HAHA, no. It doesn't end there. Because at home, i got a mom that keeps reminding me every couple minutes that I'm going to fail my classes, my grades suck, I'm not like the other """"good kids"""" they know, I can't do anything right, are you even studying?, etc. She essentially lowers my self-esteem and self-confidence to a point I just can't get back up.
For example, my mom left the country for a week last summer and I decided to audition for a new group at UBC a capella. I know I can sing, and I know I can dance. Of course, my mom comes back a day or 2 before the audition and starts fat-shaming (freshman 15 what can I say) me and telling me how I failed as a daughter, my grades suck and I don't work hard at all. And of course, you guessed it, I felt like I was tied up at my audition, I couldn't sing my full range, I didn't sing the song the way I wanted, I left out the choreography I created, and my dancing was awkward af. (I didn't get in if you were wondering)
A little off topic, sorry, but you get the point. I have no idea how I can study for my 6 finals at home without my mom's audio on repeat telling me I can't do anything and it doesn't help that I was sexually assaulted and keep getting unnecessary flashbacks whenever I least expect it. Hopefully the admins post this because I seriously have no idea what to do and despite being on antidepressants already, I think it would be best if my life ended right now. I think I just need some pointers because I don't have anyone to turn to for help.
BTW, Good luck on finals everyone! Y'all will be great! :)","#11621

Exam season is hard. I study at IKB from morning until night - I bust my ass to the 4th floor hallway tables, and stay there until 2-3 in the morning.
I’m not a coffee drinker, nor do I take stimulants to help me study; I’m all natural, 100% hard work. But I do one thing - I jerk off 6-7 times a day.
Obviously I can’t do it when I’m at IKB alone because no one’s watching my stuff, but when it gets busy, random people share my table, and every two hours without fail, I head to the washroom and do my thing.
It’s always the third stall - the first one is too big and attracts too much attention, the second one is used often, but the third one is perfect. I pull out my phone, plug my AirPods in and get to work. Oh god, the sweet release of all the pent up energy and frustration is fucking amazing. I’ve learned to do it fast too - maximum 3 minutes, and I’m never away from the table for longer than 10 minutes.
When I finish, I usually stand up and cum into the toilet, or on the seat sometimes, or even on the wall if I’m feeling a little feisty. Sometimes I clean up, sometimes I don’t - It’s all a matter of how I’m feeling that day. Then I go wash my hands, and no one is the wiser.
Anyone who’s studying should try this out, trust me it works wonders. Sometimes people ask why I’m going so often, and I usually just lie and say bad food, small bladder, whatever. One time this little asian girl asked me, and I looked her dead in the eye and straight up told her I was rubbing my cock in the washroom. She got up and left after that.
Anyways, TLDR: don’t use the 4th floor washroom third stall.","#11611

I just wanted to give a little reminder to pay attention to your friends, especially if it's a birthday or other special event.
It was my birthday not too long ago. I wasn't expecting anything special because I normally keep it relatively low key, knowing most people are busy with exams or work and the rest of their lives. This year though, since it's my last year at UBC, I decided to invite all my friends out to have a dinner. I let them know that I knew people were busy with school but I'd really like it if they could even drop by. A bunch of people messaged me saying they would come out, so I made a reservation for 12 at a restaurant. I tried to be considerate of my friend's dietary restrictions, financial budget, & location so it wouldn't be too far. I also told people I'd be around from x to y time in case they wanted to drop by and have a drink or chat.
On the day of, maybe 30min before the reservation time, people started messaging me saying they were sorry but very busy or caught up in something. No big deal, life happens.
What they didn't know was I was sitting alone at the restaurant in a giant empty table for 3 hours. Not a single person showed up. I tried to remain positive and look happy but I guess I wasn't doing a very good job because one of the waitresses saw and sat beside me for half an hour during her break. She brought me a slice of cake (one of the dessert options at the restaurant).
I went home and cried myself to sleep that night. I don't know what I've been doing wrong with my life but I just don't understand how all my ""friends"" didn't even have time to drop by to say hi, when I always make it a priority to make people feel loved during their birthday. It hurts the most when I see snaps or Instagram stories of these people doing other things that same night. I'm about to graduate but I still feel so lost about my career, friends, life in general.
Basically what I'm saying is: message your friends regularly, especially if it's their birthday. Try to make them feel important and valued. You have no idea what other people could be going through.","#11600
I just wanted to give a little reminder to pay attention to your friends, especially if it's a birthday or other special event.
It was my birthday not too long ago. I wasn't expecting anything special because I normally keep it relatively low key, knowing most people are busy with exams or work and the rest of their lives. This year though, since it's my last year at UBC, I decided to invite all my friends out to have a dinner. I let them know that I knew people were busy with school but I'd really like it if they could even drop by. A bunch of people messaged me saying they would come out, so I made a reservation for 12 at a restaurant. I tried to be considerate of my friend's dietary restrictions, financial budget, & location so it wouldn't be too far. I also told people I'd be around from x to y time in case they wanted to drop by and have a drink or chat.

1. Learn to fucking citttteeeee, I know this is a first year course but that's called plagarism! Look up app, mla, or something and do it right.
2. It would be outstanding if you actually had a good argument and didn't base everything on your opinion.
3. Some of you papers were literally rasict/sexist or otherwise discriminatory
I didn't want to give bad marks but holyyyyyy hell.","#11599

This is related to the complaint about the Masters of Data Science program:
I'm not involved in the program so I can't comment directly about it but I do want to raise a word of warning about studying programs that claim to have ""hot job prospects"".
DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ ONLINE ABOUT JOB PROSPECTS AND SALARIES. Seriously, once a week I see some article claiming crap like ""Machine Learning Engineers are in high demand"", ""Why Data Science is one of the top paying job of 2019"". Here's the thing. We've seen this shit happen with web development 2-3 years ago. Before that it was computer and mechanical engineering.
At any point in time, the media will be hyping up X career path. X professional training program will conveniently blossom all across the country to charge people an exorbitant amount of money with the promise of a well-paid job. You know what happens next? Everyone floods into these programs with their student loans, the top 10% get a job either though god-tier performance or personal connections and many just settle for pretty average pay.
I'm not saying don't pursue careers that you're passionate about or will pay you well. I'm saying be VERY skeptical of the promises a program makes.
• There's a large pool of people willing to pay money for a better job.
• There's a government willing to make loans to fund those pursuits.
• There are profit-driven institutions willing to make money off opportunities.
• There are online ""journals"" and blogs willing to partner with them.
• There are employers more than happy to increase employee supply and competition so that they keep salaries down.
If you're good at something, or really want to be good at it, please do society a service and pursue it. Don't do it because a bunch of sketchy articles told you there's a money in it and end up losing money for it. I'm speaking from personal experience and I don't want to see anyone have to learn this the hard way.","#11598

This school year, I stole items from the residence dining hall about half the times I ate there. I live in totem, and I go to either feast or open kitchen to eat. The items that I usually steal are soft drinks, desserts, milk, and sometimes even chicken stripes. Each item is about 3-8 dollars, the total amount adds up to at least 600 dollars.
I am confessing this because I feel guilty for not stealing more. I know a lot of people are doing this because they're tired of the overpriced food here and don't know any other way to protest. I definitely understand that my behaviour will not stop them from charging us ridiculous prices (in fact this will probably make it worse), but I really don't care what will happen to the students next year, this is just my way to get even-steven.","#11596

The absolute worst student politicians are the ones that say ""if you want to make a change, you should get involved"" because they can't seem to take any criticism.
This usually happens when a student society has a serious issue with exclusivity and shitty event organization. Let me just say there are plenty of student organizations who've been able to improve how inclusive they are and there are plenty of first-time event organizers who organize killer events. The issue isn't that you don't have enough students to support your efforts, the issue is that you suck at your job.
I think smart students are smart enough to not join the clusterfuck of an organization that these types of student politicians peddle bullshit within. Saying something like ""get involved to make a change"" is an excuse. Don't forget less than a month ago, some student politician was caught bullying people who were trying to make the AMS executives accountable and accusing them of being coincidentally racist and misogynistic. There are so many reasons why students shouldn't get involved in these types of organizations, the first being that saying ""get involved to make a change"" is a total red flag.
So here are the real options. You can either resign if you don't like the criticism that you're faced with, or you can stop charging me student fees so I don't have the right to criticize you anymore. Don't ask me to get involved when you're clearly just going to cry wolf when I call you out on your BS.","#11591

About a week or so ago I saw a UBC Confessions post about someone who likes to ejaculate in personal belongings at house parties. I didn't think that there was anyone out here at UBC that was like me until I read their post.
All my life I have been a little strange, but I felt like if someone was brave enough to share their secrets with the world, then I can be just like them and share my story as well.
I've been living at UBC for a little over a year now, and a little guilty pleasure of mine is cumming on shower heads/sink faucets when I finish showering/using the facilities. There's something truly pleasing about it, yet some may call it gross/disgusting.
My daily routine is that I normally finish showering and doing my business, and then I'll ejaculate onto the shower heads and rub my stuff all over into the little crevices of the shower head or the sink faucet. I know it won't really cause much harm since whenever people use the showers they'll let the faucet run for a bit waiting for the water to get warm, but there possibility of my cum just getting on someone's hand or hair just makes it so much more amusing and arousing for me. Something that's less sexual that I also do every chance I get is when I finish showering, I'll fart as hard as I can onto the door knobs or anything that someone could potentially touch after me. Normally I'll try to fart as hard as I can onto the shower heads, but sometimes I'll try to do it on to the sink handles as well, but that's more rare since it's too hard for me to get close to the knobs. Sometimes I'll finish into my hand and touch all the door knobs on my way back to my dorm. It's just so dirty and exciting for me.
I saw a lot of negative reactions to the post where the guy would finish onto personal belongings at house parties, but for the first time in my life I felt like someone truly could relate to me. I feel as if I have a chance at making a friend even if it's anonymously through UBC confessions.
I am aware that this is out of the norm and I am currently seeking help regarding these bad habits of mine, but if someone out there could relate to me as well, I could sleep better at night knowing that I had made someone feel less like an outcast similar to myself.
PS I am HIV/AIDS free so no need to worry.","#11586

The spike in posts concerning substance abuse and suicide demonstrate exactly why a page like UBC Confessions is needed. There's so much stigma about these topics and people often feel like they're suffering alone. Nothing could be further than the truth. It's a stressful time for everyone when exams are near, so if you haven't reached out to a friend or haven't checked in a while, do so! If you see a stranger crying in the library ask them how they're doing. Not to be dramatic or anything, but you very well could save someone's life in that moment.

This school is full of narcissists. Life, and UBC wasn't the school I had thought it would be.
Where do I even start?
My major (not Sauder) is full of self-centered egomaniacs, robotic in a sense that their only goal in life is to make more money and have greater prestige than their peers -- bar none. So I guess I wasn't too surprised to see people putting each other and myself down by pretentiously rubbing off their accomplishments and co-ops, thinking that they're naturally smarter and better than others (even though many, but not all, secured jobs through nepotism). People even go as far as openly talk about how they cheated on tests and faked transcripts for scholarships and jobs, thinking that it's completely justified and that it's not out of the norm at all (maybe it is, I wouldn't know). For a while, never in my life had I wanted so much to be on the somewhat of the same level as my peers. I'd try harder in school legitimately, balance jobs and extracurriculars, only to get mediocre grades and ultimately become bogged down by unpredictable episodes of depression. Perhaps it was just all of their comments getting to my head. I guess the cynic in me finally realized that I was just purely intellectually inferior to them. I didn't fit in with the people in my major, despite having an interest in similar fields since my childhood.
Alright, I can't make fit in with peers in my major. What about in extracurriculars and clubs? Every executive position I've ever had only taught me that I was incapable of socializing. Every club seemed impersonal, with narcissistic members using it merely as a tool for others to pad their resumes (ex. every student society). Every club event or social I went to, I stuck out like a sore thumb, being the person who just didn't quite seem like the rest. Others being dressed well, genetically gifted with good looks and height, and highly personable, they seemed happy with their life. Whereas I look at myself every morning in the mirror despising my short stature (5'6"""" manlet), asymmetrical and fat face, disproportionate body structure, borderline anorexia (but somehow still fat in the belly), and hair whose genetic origin probably came from the great apes. Going to the gym didn't really improve my physique. Really though, even if I tried to make myself for presentable, it would be futile. You can only make your genes go so far (aside from getting plastic surgery, though I don't have the money for that). Guess I don't fit in with people in clubs either.
I think that if you were to ask much of the people I'm describing above whether or not they have been disadvantaged in life, many would say that they have it harder than most other people. I notice almost all people would simultaneously try to one up each other in guilt olympics, acting as victims of their own stories -- only to turn around a while later stepping on everyone else with confidence. Their attempt to downplay the role of their SES in life success by pretending to be disadvantaged and victimized probably strokes their egos hard. After all, everyone's a hero of their own story.
In one of my teams, I was the only person who didn't speak Chinese. We would conduct all of our meetings starting in English, only to switch to Chinese thereafter in a couple of minutes, and for the rest of the meeting. Sitting there smiling and nodding, yet inside feeling like a dehumanized second class citizen. I practically wasn't acknowledged, not even eye contact was given to me. Mind you, I am third generation Chinese thus I can't speak any mandarin aside from ""hello"". I wanted to fit in there, I guess that didn't work either.
Over the past few years at UBC, ""friends"" that I would seem to get to know very well for a year or so eventually distance themselves away from me. Were they just using me for academics, money, car rides, or just simply out of spite? Did they see the same in me as I did in them? Regardless, I tried to rationalize in my head for a while that they were just busy, or I was to blame for being socially cold (which is weakness of mine for sure, though I mean no harm). I guess I'm just merely an asset to these people. I've even tried to take long breaks away from social media to see who would actually contact me (guess what the answer to that is). Really, I don't know how to socialize legitimately with people, and probably couldn't pinpoint anyone in particular as close enough I could share feelings such as these to.
Currently, I feel as if my body is slowly breaking down. I am perpetually exhausted, depressed, lonely, directionless, and emotionally numb from years of constant abuse and failure. I sleep 12 hours a day and still have no energy. Nothing sparks any shred of happiness anymore. Things that I used to enjoy passionately seem like mundane tasks. The last 5 or so years of surprise cyclic depression has worn me down to my bones. I ignore my hunger at times, perplexed, because eating doesn't even feel good anymore. I feel no motivation to study for my finals. Seeing others do well constantly reminds me that I am a failure. My parents don't know about the multiple antidepressants, drug abuse, loneliness, and morally questionable things I've done. If I were to even mention depression, they would say that I'm ungrateful (and I know because they laugh at people who have ""depression""), and probably compare my struggle as minuscule compared to theirs. I would probably agree, given the luxuries and financial (but not emotional) support that they have given me growing up. They came to the Canada with very little cash, no education, and no family support. They've busted ass so that I could enjoy growing up middle class and going to a school far away, rather than how they started off living in slum-like environments. Yet, I've accomplished so little compared to them. I wish I could have an open and honest conversation with them, but I know that it's just not worth it -- Asian cultural values have been cemented too deep in their heads. I can't even talk to my older brother, him and I are not on speaking terms, perhaps because of a large age difference. We practically didn't grow up with each other.
I wish I didn't hate the social atmosphere of this school. I wish I could commit to doing something that I like. I wish I lived up to my own expectations, much less my parents. I wish I could blame my mental illnesses on shitty asian parenting growing up, though, I know that I'm an adult now, and I should be taking responsibility for every action I do. I really wished that this school would be a positive stepping stone towards a brighter future. Instead, I was met with hostility and indifference. Perhaps university is really just a microcosm of the ""real world™"", and that the struggles after university will probably be even greater. Clearly, I wasn't prepared for this, nor do I think I ever will be. This rat race is harsh, and very real. That's just the simple reality of this world. There is no true empathy in this world; the root of every action is ultimately dictated by self interest.
I've already started to slowly sell my personal belongings, hopefully to give back a bank draft of a small positive dent in the colossal waste of money my parents invested in me. Besides, my brother was their favourite child anyways, better for him to inherit the money.
In the grand scheme of things, and by all terms and definitions, I am a failure. Just like evolution and natural selection, those who are left behind get killed off. I am the branch of the evolutionary tree that should've been cut off long ago. Such is how the human race improves anyways. I'm probably going go radio silence and fly far, far, away to Europe just to experience life for a last bit. I'll finish these last finals, and when I inevitably fail those I'll probably finally commit to off myself for real. Please don't try to coerce me out of this, counselling didn't help nor did meds, and I've ruminated about this plan since high school anyways. Consider this as a net positive change to the gene pool.","#11579

Every club event or social I went to, I stuck out like a sore thumb, being the person who just didn't quite seem like the rest. Others being dressed well, genetically gifted with good looks and height, and highly personable, they seemed happy with their life. Whereas I look at myself every morning in the mirror despising my short stature (5'6"""" manlet), asymmetrical and fat face, disproportionate body structure, borderline anorexia (but somehow still fat in the belly), and hair whose genetic origin probably came from the great apes. Going to the gym didn't really improve my physique. Really though, even if I tried to make myself for presentable, it would be futile. You can only make your genes go so far (aside from getting plastic surgery, though I don't have the money for that). Guess I don't fit in with people in clubs either.
I think that if you were to ask much of the people I'm describing above whether or not they have been disadvantaged in life, many would say that they have it harder than most other people. I notice almost all people would simultaneously try to one up each other in guilt olympics, acting as victims of their own stories -- only to turn around a while later stepping on everyone else with confidence. Their attempt to downplay the role of their SES in life success by pretending to be disadvantaged and victimized probably strokes their egos hard. After all, everyone's a hero of their own story.
In one of my teams, I was the only person who didn't speak Chinese. We would conduct all of our meetings starting in English, only to switch to Chinese thereafter in a couple of minutes, and for the rest of the meeting. Sitting there smiling and nodding, yet inside feeling like a dehumanized second class citizen. I practically wasn't acknowledged, not even eye contact was given to me. Mind you, I am third generation Chinese thus I can't speak any mandarin aside from ""hello"". I wanted to fit in there, I guess that didn't work either.
Over the past few years at UBC, ""friends"" that I would seem to get to know very well for a year or so eventually distance themselves away from me. Were they just using me for academics, money, car rides, or just simply out of spite? Did they see the same in me as I did in them? Regardless, I tried to rationalize in my head for a while that they were just busy, or I was to blame for being socially cold (which is weakness of mine for sure, though I mean no harm). I guess I'm just merely an asset to these people. I've even tried to take long breaks away from social media to see who would actually contact me (guess what the answer to that is). Really, I don't know how to socialize legitimately with people, and probably couldn't pinpoint anyone in particular as close enough I could share feelings such as these to.
Currently, I feel as if my body is slowly breaking down. I am perpetually exhausted, depressed, lonely, directionless, and emotionally numb from years of constant abuse and failure. I sleep 12 hours a day and still have no energy. Nothing sparks any shred of happiness anymore. Things that I used to enjoy passionately seem like mundane tasks. The last 5 or so years of surprise cyclic depression has worn me down to my bones. I ignore my hunger at times, perplexed, because eating doesn't even feel good anymore. I feel no motivation to study for my finals. Seeing others do well constantly reminds me that I am a failure. My parents don't know about the multiple antidepressants, drug abuse, loneliness, and morally questionable things I've done. If I were to even mention depression, they would say that I'm ungrateful (and I know because they laugh at people who have ""depression""), and probably compare my struggle as minuscule compared to theirs. I would probably agree, given the luxuries and financial (but not emotional) support that they have given me growing up. They came to the Canada with very little cash, no education, and no family support. They've busted ass so that I could enjoy growing up middle class and going to a school far away, rather than how they started off living in slum-like environments. Yet, I've accomplished so little compared to them. I wish I could have an open and honest conversation with them, but I know that it's just not worth it -- Asian cultural values have been cemented too deep in their heads. I can't even talk to my older brother, him and I are not on speaking terms, perhaps because of a large age difference. We practically didn't grow up with each other.
I wish I didn't hate the social atmosphere of this school. I wish I could commit to doing something that I like. I wish I lived up to my own expectations, much less my parents. I wish I could blame my mental illnesses on shitty asian parenting growing up, though, I know that I'm an adult now, and I should be taking responsibility for every action I do. I really wished that this school would be a positive stepping stone towards a brighter future. Instead, I was met with hostility and indifference. Perhaps university is really just a microcosm of the ""real world™"", and that the struggles after university will probably be even greater. Clearly, I wasn't prepared for this, nor do I think I ever will be. This rat race is harsh, and very real. That's just the simple reality of this world. There is no true empathy in this world; the root of every action is ultimately dictated by self interest.
I've already started to slowly sell my personal belongings, hopefully to give back a bank draft of a small positive dent in the colossal waste of money my parents invested in me. Besides, my brother was their favourite child anyways, better for him to inherit the money.
In the grand scheme of things, and by all terms and definitions, I am a failure. Just like evolution and natural selection, those who are left behind get killed off. I am the branch of the evolutionary tree that should've been cut off long ago. Such is how the human race improves anyways. I'm probably going go radio silence and fly far, far, away to Europe just to experience life for a last bit. I'll finish these last finals, and when I inevitably fail those I'll probably finally commit to off myself for real. Please don't try to coerce me out of this, counselling didn't help nor did meds, and I've ruminated about this plan since high school anyways. Consider this as a net positive change to the gene pool.",,1555093800,,,34,22,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2392567177428228&id=1287650764586547,

So my sleep deprived self just walked into the bathroom, ripped it back and yelled ""nOT TODAY, GOBLINS!"". As the sound of that echoed around my empty apartment I caught a glance of myself in the mirror and took a good, long look at myself.

I was doing absolute garbage in all my courses and I had gone from being consistently above average in first year to consistently below. It was a huge pain in the butt getting the different departments to actually talk to each other to figure out what I needed to switch the major and getting approval for bla bla bla but now that I'm almost done one semester in this new program I cannot emphasize how much it was worth it. My average has literally gone up almost 30% from last semester and I actually love what I'm learning sooo much more now. If you're not quite feeling what you're doing, even if it was something that you once really wanted, make that change sooner rather than later. You'll be thanking yourself.

(I would like to first apologize to the admins for how sexually explicit this is)
Sometimes, I feel bad for straight women at UBC. I’ve spoken to some of you about your sex lives and frankly, it sounds boring af.
I would like to assume that in 2019 men are better about reciprocity in the bedroom, but experience has proven otherwise. You may think the sex is dece, but if it’s just decent then you can probably have better.
Sure, the dick may be bomb, but does he eat the kitty willingly? Would he let you sit on his face? Would he spend the entire time making sure you have the best orgasm of your life without anything in return? Has he ever made you cum so hard you go blind momentarily and can’t walk?
Would he let you top? And I don’t mean riding. I mean could you take control in the bedroom. Could you tie him up and just use his body as your own personal sex toy?
How freaky could you get with him? Would he let you eat him out? Finger him? Peg him? Their g-spot is literally up their asshole yet some of them are too scared of being seen as gay to experience an orgasm that makes them want to thank God.
For the ones whose boyfriends want a 3some, can it only be with another girl, or can you say you want a guy instead? If the answer to that is no, why not? Despite it usually being the girl that’s the active unicorn hunter, it seems awfully for the bf’s benefit. Would your bf get upset if you suggested another dude? If so, why?
Some of you might not even want these things, which is fine. I’m not gonna yuck your yum.
But for the ones that do, and are not currently receiving that, do you think about it?
After you’ve had sex with your bf who’s passed out beside you cause his refractory period sucks, and you’re lying there still kinda horny, would you say you’re satisfied? Or do you think that’s all there is?
Sweetheart, you deserve better. You deserve so much better. If you’re gonna chase after a guy because of the dick, the dick better be high quality and comes with various bonus packages, cause anything less than that will leave you wanting a refund.","#11554

Being around my family and friends made me feel good, so I came back with a more positive outlook and I was motivated to do better this term. However, here I am, in the last week of classes, and I have learnt that I will definitely fail at least 2 classes (9 credits). I don’t know what to do.

UBC should offer more online courses. The amount of courses I have taken both within and outside my own faculty, which can be run online, is quiet significant.
Online courses are more practical for poor commuter students and students who need to work during school. A significant number of domestic students and a handful of international students are in this situation. Online courses could be offered at much lower price, decreasing tuition prices, as well as enable more people to pursue a degree. It can help people with disabilities and mobility issues. Exams can still be run on campus. There is no negative outcome in making education more affordable and accessible.","#11536

This is my last week of school as a UBC undergrad, and it still amazes me how students here go to libraries just for socializing. Why are you even speaking or whispering your entire conversations in the silent study spaces?
I've been to many universities around the world in different countries in US, UK etc. and NEVER have I ever heard students chatting loudly in libraries - if they do at all. They would be courteous and step outside and bring the conversation somewhere else.
Some of my high school classmates who go to university elsewhere are always confused when I tell them that I can't study in UBC libraries because of the noise volume.
Sure, you might say that I've studied here for 4 years and should be used to the noise by now or found a silent study space on campus. At the same time, I simply don't understand how students casually meet up in libraries for a chat. Sure, IKB is a learning centre with classrooms and that's a different story. There should be clearer designation of areas group projects vs. quiet study vs. silent study.
Is there anyone else who advocate for more silent study areas on campus?","#11535

No chicken, no veggies, no nuts, no chocolate. Only cereal and milk 7 days a week. The only thing that changes is the brands from Cheerio's to Vector, and the different milks from the standard, to cashew to nut based milks.Coming from a perspective of someone who eats three balanced meals a day, I cannot fathom at how his body functions.

Judging by the low voter turnout in the AMS election, a large majority of students are been tryanised by the minority of students that did vote. Isn't the entire purpose of voting is that every single student get to have a say but due to our lack of participation, we are essentially being held hostage by the small group of students that did vote.
The shit happening at the AMS is entirely due to our lack of participation, allowing candidates to run away with corruption instead of candidates that truly want to change UBC for the better. If we as university students do not participate in our own student elections, what does it say as a whole to the country?
As less and less of our voice gets heard, candidates only need to persuade a smaller group of students to get themselves elected. Effectively letting a minority of the population to dictate the future of UBC. The purpose of having votes is so that we given the a chance to make a change, no matter no small it may be, every effort counts. With over 60k students in UBC, the voice of one doesn't matter but if we all actually put an effort into this, we can change UBC for the better and for future students.
Make UBC into what it can be rather than what it is, a student society filled with candidates that do not represent the greater community of UBC but rather positions for their resumes.","#11533

TW: drug use.
This is my third month on Modafinil. I’m a depressed, anti-social undergrad who struggles with my failing GPA cos I fucked up my grades when I first transferred to UBC. It’s already humiliating for me that I wasted 2 years before I entered college but now my GPA is shit.
I’ve received one warning for my poor academic performance last year, and desperate for a good GPA, I started experimenting with Modafinil with coffee (WARNING, do not mix 200mg of Modafinil with caffeine, you will not like it). It puts my brain on autopilot and allows me to stay focus and rocket thru 9:30am lectures that is theory-heavy without wanting to stab myself in the testicles.
The trade-off? It gave me pretty horrible bowel most of the times, and it doesn’t help with my introvertness. Modafinil does alleviate my social anxiety for a bit. It’s hard for me to explain the feeling but it’s like you taking the back seat and give orders to someone else to drive your car. This particular disassociation makes me less scared with social interaction ,but it makes me stare at people’s face or course slides without blinking so I end up looking like a psychopath.
I don’t know why I’m typing this here. I guess I feel bad for using drug to boost my grades. I’m happy that my grades are better than ever, but I worry that I’ll end up relying on drug for all my academic problems. I worry that people will reject me for taking drugs for my grades, not that I have any friends in UBC to begin with.
As I’m typing this, I just cracked another tablet of Modafinil that I’ll take tomorrow for my soon-to-due 10-page essay.","#11527

tl;dr UBC's Master of Data Science is really a crappy program.
We had a professor in our lab who was involved in the design of the UBC’s Master of Data Science program. During a lab meeting, he told us all the darkness behind the program. Apparently the program is designed without much approval from the professors in the statistics program. For those who don’t know, the program is only 10-month long. Given the short length of the program, of course, you can’t get properly trained in statistical modelling. Of course, they will omit probability and statistical inference (which are essential to the understanding of statistics) because it takes ***TIME** to train students about those things. Half of the program is teaching you writing up some random code in R so that you can fit some random regression model and generate some fancy graphs. And apparently no students can fail that program. So imagine students graduated from these programs get hired in the industry… Many important decisions may be made based on the crappy statistical analyses they made….. The 10-month program costs as much as my whole undergrad degree… It is obvious that UBC designed this crappy program just for MONEY.","#11524

As a Muslim on campus I was deeply offended by what happened during the vigil ceremony for the New Zealand shooting victims. The songs, performance is not part of an Islamic culture and I have never seen a vigil like this where people are promoting their own brand and not actually talking about the victims.
I was hurt to see that no one prayed for the elevation of their status, for the forgiveness of their sins, for the easement of suffering that their families are going through. Instead, after the Prof's speech the who vigil became a performance show with the drumming and chanting. THAT IS NOT ISLAMIC TRADITION. In Islam at a time like this, you pray to Allah for the forgiveness of sins, remember that one day we will all go back to him, pray for the families etc.
The thing that bothered me the most was that walk which was only to promote that group of men with black hoodies, it had nothing to do with the victims or their families or to show grief, sadness over the tragedy that had just occurred.
I have not seen such a thing in all my life, I have lived in way too many Muslim countries to know for sure that this is not the way to show solidarity, grief. If it was a promotional stunt, then please call it that and don't associate it with the innocent victims and their families because they got nothing out of it, and neither did you project the true image of Islam to our UBC community.
I sincerely pray that it was an honest mistake and that that walk/ performances had nothing to do with promoting your brand. May we all stand equal in front of God.","#11509

TLDR: If you live on campus, be aware: you can get booted at any time
Dear year round housing,
I'd like to thank you for this great month I've been having. You see, I am one of the many residents of Marine Drive Building 1 who is being relocated next month. For those reading this who are not aware, all of the residents of Marine Drive Building 1, floors 3 and 4, are being relocated as the floors are being renovated into Winter Residences, as Marine Drive needs to ""update and renovate"".
Now, this is not what I'm here to write about. I completely understand that the residence needs a revamp. Hell, the kitchen tile floors, which, I'm sure, were once a brilliant white, are now so stained that you could probably sell them at a yard sale as a 'styled tile'.
What I'm here to complain is the complete inadequacy of your response to your residents. First, you ask us to fill out a form, to state if we would like to continue living on residence year round, or if we would like a winter residence instead. Then you state that you will contact us on the 18th of March to confirm you got our request. Surprise, surprise, you did not.
And then, when you finally send us the offer, it states this:
Offer Date: March 28, 2019
Expiry Date: March 27, 2019

Some of you domestic students need to fucking realize not every international student is rich. Not all of us are privileged. Yea we're dependent on our parents, but what do you expect? That we can work full time, and study at the same time, and just be able to pay up 40K a year (just tuition btw)? Grow some fucking brain cells. And just because our parents are able to pay that much money in tuition doesn't automatically mean we're rich. Almost all of that money comes from lifelong savings of our parents' hard work. The reason they send us to a uni abroad, such as UBC, is so that we don't ever have to go through the struggle they did in order to come up in life.
So yes. When we see that tuition is going up every year, we're gonna be mad.
What pissed me off the most was the comment section on an article the Ubyssey FB page posted regarding international students getting angry over the tuition increase. Some of them literally assumed and said shit like ""sucks to be privileged"" or ""look at these butthurt privileged international kids"" (Yes. If you see this you know who you are).

Do any other girls in STEM specifically comp sci or apsc feel as though they are getting mansplained all the time by their male peers?
Sure, this doesn't always happen with all guys I work with, and never with other girls. But in a STEM field where the ego is largest, we are constently trying to prove to others how much smarter we are, and overall tend to automatically show off your smarts by dumbing down things for peers that you judge ""less intelligent"" than you.
The problem is that women tend to be portrayed as less capable than their male peers, resulting in a constant, hearty dose of mansplaning everyday.
When studying programming or math in small groups, my output often gets completely brushed off, even when it is right.
In some instances when i solve a problem that we all have been working on, it quickly gets brushed off as unlikely, and when everyone ends up at that same conclusion later, they proceed to explain to me the same solution of the problem which i literally solved a few minutes ago!
Guys in STEM probably mean no harm, but please stop trying to explain obvious things without us asking first, it's annoying and really demeaning. We are just as capable as understanding things as you are, and do not need you to paraphrase an instruction manuel that we just read.
It's not easy to notice what just feels natural, so next time, stop, and think. Did she ask you for help? No? Then don't say anything.
Even if she looks like she's struggling on a problem, chances are that if she hasn't asked for help yet, she is still working on it and doesn't need you to spoil the solution by chucking a vomit of information at her to show off how much smarter you are.
This is a behaviour that has been drilled into our heads since we were kids, but this needs to stop.","#11500

About a week ago I started up a business on twitter/insta selling feet pics. Now there are obviously a few downsides.
1) I've done exactly 0 studying since then and have just been fielding dirty messages and comments from old borderline illiterate white men.
2) For the gotdam amount of work I've put in you'd think i'd be rolling in cash!! But the feetconomy is tough these days i guess...
3) My insta and twitter feeds are the most disgusting things I've ever seen.
4) I've come to the realization that this is just a stepping stone to becoming a cam girl or sex worker.
Despite all of this, i'm still gonna keep doing it because the comments I get on my feet posts is the most validation I've ever received in my life 😞 even if it is just for having ""perfectly flawless feet, goddess"".
Side confession: my fifth grade self would be very disappointed in me, especially because in addition to this I'm about to get into a fwb situation and I've started day drinking rosé
Anyway long story short i'm a terrible human being and I'm about to transfer to sauder because my entrepreneurial talents are being wasted in science.","#11498

I still remember that day in my class where this girl in front of me had her laptop on. While the prof was talking, she was going through the slides of the lecture and suddenly I started to notice she was translating ""the"", ""what"", ""with"", and some basic, *essential* English words to Chinese. She gave up and translated the whole sentences lol.
I honestly was very shook and I felt like it was a slap in the face:
I remember struggling to write a good personal profile, trying my best in English class to get a mark at least good enough for ubc admissions. I felt cheated because all this time UBC has lied to me about how I deserved the spot at UBC and how I should be proud while now knowing there are many out there who don't seem like they even tried. Im not expecting anyone's English to be superior or whatever (I used to be esl lol) but I never thought I didn't have to speak English to be here.
Future UBC students, UBC is still a great university but dont think youre going into some elite school for deserving people. It's all about $$$
P.s. I was wondering how they would do on an exam.","#11484

Hi UBCC, and everyone else reading this. I'm the OP from #2999. At the time I submitted my original confession, I was suffering from consistent suicidal thoughts, and had just been turned away from UBC Hospital after trying to seek help from them. Seeing the increase of the suicide-longing and depressed posts on this page recently, I wanted to share the one resource at UBC that did eventually put me out of the dark.
'Empower Me' is a 24/7 helpline available to UBC students both over the phone and online chat platform. I know that BC Crisis Centre offers the same resources, BUT what was particularly important about Empower Me (for me) was that after calling them on practically a daily basis to help me get through my suicidal thoughts and just make it to the next day, they finally decided to connect me with a Vancouver-based therapist, and I met the therapist within a week of being connected with them. More importantly, the my first 3 sessions were financially covered by UBC and if the therapist deems necessary, they can get an additional 3 sessions covered by UBC for you. I later recommended this route to another friend, and they were also quickly connected with a therapist.
Maybe this pathway also exists through other resources, like the BC Crisis Centre, and perhaps some of you have already tried Empower Me, but didn't find it helpful. I'm writing this purely in the tiny chance that it'll help someone else out as well, if they haven't already tried it. I also wanted to write this so that if there's anyone out there also struggling to make it to the next day, please know that I understand your pain, but I promise a brighter day will come. Please, just hold on.
Here's a link to access Empower Me: http://www.studentcare.ca/rte/en/UniversityofBritishColumbiaAMSGSS_EmpowerMe_EmpowerMe
Lots of love from a UBC alumnus.","#11480

Growing up through my years of school, I've always been socially awkward and I've never had too many friends. When I got to UBC and went to my first frat party, it felt like i finally had people around me who liked me even though that's never really the case at frat parties. It still felt like i had a sense of belonging more than I ever have before. After about my third frat party I felt like I was pretty done with that whole scene so I went to a house party. It was a whole new world and I felt again like I belonged and I was hanging out with my friends even though I wouldn't see most of them ever again.
Fast forward to about my 4th house party? I decided to try something new. I would snoop around their house, looking through drawers, closets and backpacks. Basically anything where people could hide stuff. I've found money but I've never taken it. I just enjoyed looking through peoples stuff. Until recently I did something some people might consider fucked up but I personally find it hilarious.
Near the end of the party when things are winding down, I would sneak away to a room i found earlier in the night with an object I also found sometime through the night and I would jerk off and cum inside it. These items varied from family photos, pencil cases and even the outside of a loaf of Wonderbread. I haven't been caught yet and I don't intend on stopping until I am finally caught. There's just something so fun about marking my territory. My favorite things to cum on are clean laundry (cuz that's hard to find at a house party lol) and inside shoes because I know people are probably going to be wearing them. I highly encourage others to give it a try before judging. I didn't think i'd be here a year ago but I am now. I hope someone else could related with me on this too!","#11476

Trigger warning: Mental Health
Berating someone with anxiety and depression, interrogating them about their lifestyles and telling them they are having a breakdown does not help them at all. Reminding or trying to diagnose someone through ""you are not okay, you are a wreck, or you are having a breakdown"" does not give people with mental illness any sort of comfort. We know we are not okay, we know there are things we need to take care of in life. We have our own goals and expectations to get better. That's why we go to mental health services, so they can diagnose and help us get there. Not by friends (if I can even call them as friends) shaming you. We seek help in mental health services to seek an unbiased opinion on our lifestyles and how we can improve our lives and thus better help our mental illnesses. We seek comfort from friends and family because that comfort offers a sort of emotional and personal comfort that counselling services may not be able to fulfill because the counselor is not your close friend and may not know you as personally as friends do. Sometimes we just want to let our emotions out even though we are getting logical, professional help. We don't want constant attention on it, we don't want mental illness to define us, we just want to get it out in the air so people are aware of it and move on. It's an internal battle that we fight by ourselves inside our head.
The personalities and traits that got you to want to be friends with us, are still there. Please, please, please just focus more on the friendships and bonds that could be made if people just let us find our way out of this. Don't give us an ultimatum of ""fix yourself or we won't talk to you""","#11473

I hate using the word abused, but I really don't know what this is anymore. I don't know what my relationship with my parents is called. They feed me, the cloth me. They never hit me. I love them, and I know they love me. So I hate making this confession. But... Everything about my life is controlled by them in the sense that I am financially dependent on them. They control my finances. They see everything on my bank account. I can't get a job without them threatening to kick me out. I need money, sometimes just to splurge. Occasionally, I get pocket money, and I've been saving those little pocket changes up in another account I opened for this reason. I think this is common among Asian parents, but they always tell me 'if I need money, I can just ask them'. But when I do, even if it's something stupid I want like a book or something, they won't give it because they say it's a luxury. I know it's true, but I just wish they would see my side. I don't spend much. I'm not asking them for money they don't want to give. That's why I want my own money. I just don't see, if you don't have money. Let me get my own. Why do they want it both ways?
I hate being essentially a man child, always having to ask. I never ask for small things. I WANT to work to spoil myself. Yeah, I can't pay rent as a student and worker, but at least let me take the burden off you. Try to see it from my point of view. I know they'll be sad, but if I was broke, I'll never ask them for money. For me, the best life is a life of freedom. Yet they berate me and tell me that working for a boss is no different than listening to them.
I know this is probably petty, but I still need to say this, I've been having suicidal thoughts because of this total lack of freedom. I know this is a little incoherent confession, but I guess I just need help when I'm in a financially controlled situation.","#11472

in my CS labs, i overheard a couple people talking about UBC being ""unwelcoming"" and ""unfriendly"" and I couldnt believe it. first off, these people are the classmates you have that you see everyday but just dont talk to. i make an effort to say hello and asked about school and whatnot since i see them everyday. but they usually turn their head and brush me off. its crazy that they then go around and talk about ubc being a bad place to make friends.
look if youre an awkward CS kid, you gotta understand small talk is necessary. DONT be one of those people who think small talk is a waste of time since no one actually cares. FAKE interest is necessary sometimes. Youre right, no one does care how their profs day has been, and you certainly dont tell coop company interview #4 that you only care about getting a coop job + getting paid. but when you dont have real interest in something, if you want to establish a relationship you gotta fake it. Because gradually you open up and the other person opens up and talking becomes easier. Being around each other becomes pleasant. fake interest can lead to real interest.
im not saying to go around creeping everyone out with super enthusiastic greetings, just return a hello and comment on anything! what are they holding, howd this midterm go, hows this lab going, start small! you cant expect other people to be welcoming and friendly when youre so closed off yourself.","#11470

I've been homeless for a short while. I can't stay at my abusive household, but I also can't afford rez. I also don't have a job, so that kinda sucks (I really should get one soon).
How does one survive without money at ubc you may ask? Easy. This is the hobo survival guide to ubc.
Food:
Cheap options include McDicks (mobile offers are good), and instant noods.
You can also get ur rez friends to buy u rez food because they have a discount, and then pay them back.
Some places you might not know though:
The Cube at ICICS has cheap af food.
The ESC Eatery (Im in engineering) has very cheap options. 75 cents for coffee if you bring a mug (any size) is a great deal
My own collegia also helps with some free chips, hot chocolate, or snacks.
Some advertising booths at the est offer free food as well.
Open Kithen at OC is the real gold mine though. You will not believe the amount of people who just leave food behind. Today I just got a small cheesecake, still in its package, perfectly intact, left behind. I waited 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15... no one came back for it. This wasn't the first time either. Time and time again people leave their food behind, wasting it. I am the leftovers ranger, scavenging for your food.
Water:
Tap water of course, but they also have infused tap water at OC.
Shelter:
You can sleep at libraries, other buildings, even rez floor lounges. But also don't be afraid to ask your friends on rez for a place to stay. I am forever grateful for my friends for both food and shelter when I needed it most.
Clothes: literally handwash your clothes in the sink or something. Or ask ur rez friends for their laundry card
Hygiene:
Showers at the pool, Arbutus collegia, or the ESC. You can also ask your rez friends (i love you guys). Brushing your teeth is okay at most washrooms.
Storage: once again i must thank my rez friends, but i also am grateful for my lockers in both Arbutus collegium and the chem building.
And thats how you survive at ubc as a jobless hobo. I could have never done it without my friends on rez. Thanks once again you guys <3","#11467

Why do nice girls never get a chance? I've tried everything! From walking around campus saying 'good morning/afternoon' to potential boyfriends and offering coffees to boys that yawn!
What else must I do???
I had troubles at my high school and literally moved all the way out to UBC (I'm from China) in order to try and achieve something, that is, get a Canadian boyfriend.
Is it because of my severe acne? Has dating gone this far mad that superficial characteristics such as weight and looks are considered high above all else and not character, not stuff that actually matters such as how much of a good person I am?
Why can't I be born in the 50s when superficial looks didn't matter and technology like iPhones didn't exist so that boys could stop using apps like Tinder and actually try to have meaningful, fruitful relationships.
I've tried Tinder. But I either do not match or match with people who have less than admired characteristics or bots that literally swerve me.
Heck, I have Yeezy shoes, Gucci tops and Supreme backpacks and listen to k- pop and khip-hop like TWICE, BTS, Zico, Dean and DPR live. I find them all so boring but I do it because now, I can do k-pop covers.
Please someone be my bf...

On my visit to Japan couple years ago, I bought some doujins at Comiket. I waited hours in line just to get in so I figured the least I could do was buy some merch. Little did I know 90% of it was just hentai. I visited 2 booths and picked some doujins from series I liked. After bringing it back home, I worried my parents would somehow find it in my room so I decided to bring them with me in my backpack to class.
Every day.
For 2 full years.
On the bus. In class. Out at events. I had fucking hentai on me almost everywhere I went. For 2 fucking years.
I am now confessing since I'm now renting my own place and I have finally relieved myself of this burden.","#11459

Let’s see if you guys like this:
My boyfriend of 5 years and I have fought a lot in the past but this fight was the worst, he actually hit me and hurt me. It was shocking and terrifying for me and I have genuine fear for him now but I obviously still love him. Every time I think of what he did to me I feel genuine fear but I still love him and need him. We had sex the other night after the fight and I was lying on top of him with my back to his chest and after he came he fell asleep with his dick still inside me in the same position. We had drank a bottle of wine together before so I had already had multiple orgasms but I couldn’t resist playing with my clit while he slept. His dick was still hard and I masturbated to the whole 5 years of our relationship and everything down to the beatings and had the most thrilling orgasm of my life. 10/10 strongly recommend.","#11458

tw: mental health
I'd like to say to all those struggling with mental health, especially psychosis and suicidal thoughts: I believe in you.
Last term was really hard for me. I struggled a lot with suicidal thoughts and the urge to harm myself. I'm guessing it's stress, because I never dealt with things like this in high school. But last term things got really bad, to the point where I'd start believing that nothing was real, and hearing things that weren't there. I started to obsess about walking into traffic, and jumping off high buildings. I started this nervous tick where I would scratch my thighs until I was bleeding. I knew that I needed to do something, because it felt like all the joy I had for being with friends, studying interesting things, and eating good food had all dried up.
In January, I decided to get serious about my mental health. I worked to even out my medication, I cut down on the stuff I did outside of school, and I started gardening in my room.
Honestly, the thing that helped me the most was getting up every day to water my plants. At first it was a pitiful garden. Just some old jam jars and an egg carton that I filled with dirt, but I kept growing it every day. And there's something so healing about watching these little sprouts that you planted start to push through the soil. Even on the days where I couldn't leave my room and skipped class because I felt like garbage, I would get up to check on how my plants were.
I want to stay alive because I need to water my plants. I can't make a living thing dependant on me, and then let them die. I get up every day and give them a little spritz.
But more so, my plants motivate me to stay in school despite my bad mental health, my mediocre grades, and how much I struggle. I want to study plants, and having my little guys there every morning gives me clarity of why I'm working so hard. It makes me not fall into the hopelessness my depression wants me to fall into. I suppose feeling this strongly about plants is rather silly. But it's helping me to keep living and stay on track, so I'm alright with being silly as long as I'm alive and not hurting myself.
My little bedroom garden takes up a quarter of my room now, and I love all of my plants. I have chives, garlic, broccoli, pumpkin, squash, four o cock, marigolds, basil, Peas, tomatos, and even an avacado pit that just started growing a root. It's so good to feel passionate about something again.","#11452

They talked about complex business concepts one minute then argue about some dumb shit any normal person would know the next. The entire conversation convinced me that these business students live in a bubble. Do you want to know the reason you haven't found a job yet? You don't live in reality. It's easy to learn concepts but surprisingly difficult for you all to apply them.

How the fuck are you going to do your role with your million other stuff already on your plate. Stop trying to resume pat for fucks sake... 5 jobs at 50% <<< 1 job at 100%
Third Issue: ...actually lack thereof. This whole ""sus execs are premeds"" doesn't apply TOO much here, but let me emphasis not TOO MUCH. There are still some people who it's very clear are doing this for reasons they shouldn't *cough UBC med doesn't care for SUS cough*

Hello,
To the people that know me in real life; I am an outgoing person that loves affection, interactions, as well as treating others. I smile a lot, have a bubbly personality, and seems to go on with her life indifferent to all of the typical student stress others go to. I am someone that hears my friend's concerns and worries in hopes that they find solace in being able to release their stress through talking about it. They describe me as a kind person.
I have not gone through any traumatic events nor suffer from any terminal illness. Sure, there have been some bumps along my life, but all of the troubles have been fairly insignificant to be called impactful. I come from a decently well-off family, I have a job, I'm passing all of my courses, I have friends, my parents are still here, I live without worrying about my next meal.
So why do I want to kill myself? Why do I feel like I have depression? Surely, this feeling of dread is not unfounded; I experience it everyday. I ask myself: what right do I have to feel this way? Perhaps I am saying all of this to be a drama queen, to attract attention. Perhaps I am faking this feeling of dread, these dastardly thoughts that prevent me from wanting to live.
Why don't I seek help? Because I do not know how genuine this feeling of dread is. How can I seek help knowing that there are others with far worse situations in their life? How can I take precious counselling time away from them to alleviate whatever ""horrible situation"" I am in? It's because of people like me that mental health isn't taken seriously. It's because of fakers like me that people have to wait so long to see the counsellor.
I cry for help yet do not have the courage to say it out loud. I don't want to feel this way.
I'm sorry.","#11428

The recent scandal regarding the elite paying their child's way into colleges got me thinking. I swear some people in UBC might have bought their way in or bought their way for a passing grade. I'm a fourth year, and some people in my cohort have zero grasp of the fundamentals taught in second year, without which you could not pass at all. I have no idea how they made it this far. Not just specific to my faculty, I've experienced the same taking courses from other faculties. It doesn't help that a majority of these people happened to be international students. It's either they've bought their way in, or UBC meddles with grades of international students so they look good to prospective international students. And the latter is not unrealistic. There should be an investigation regarding this.","#11425

Fuck the UBC Free Speech Club.
Inviting (and paying) speakers who spout white supremacist talking points about ""white genocide"" and how certain races are genetically inferior due to low IQ isn't a test of free speech, it's evidence of your enthusiasm for racism and bigotry.
The last speaker they invited was a comedian.... who happened to tweet, ""If a black guy rapes you and you call him a n**ger, Hollywood would be more offended by the word not the act. That is true"". I censored the slur but he tweeted that in all its glory, just months before the Free Speech Club decided to invite him to UBC. See a pattern?

I am shocked and disappointed at the UBC student community for electing Max Holmes to become one of our Board of Governors representative. The BOG represents the pinnacle of high level decision making at UBC, and to have such a irresponsible person represent us to the Board is at best, embarrassing, and at worst, detrimental to our day to day life at UBC. From his days as the AMS Elections Administrator, to his treatment of the previous Elections Administrator, to the verbal intimidation and shaming he subjected the Chair of the AMS Governance Committee and the President of the EUS detailed in the Ubyssey, Max has shown time and time again that he is unable to accept criticism, and tries to shout down and berate his opposition into submission. In fact, last year, I heard an rumour of Max bullying AMS staff, though I'm not sure how accurate this rumour was. When he can't do that, he hides behind ridiculous claims, like the claim that a censure motion that was brought against him, was because the AMS President was a Woman of Colour, and not that because Executives broke the AMS Code. His hypocrisy in trying to shut down SASC when he ran on a survivor-centric platform shows that he can't even be trusted to uphold his signature campaign promises. And give him a task that almost everyone supports, the Fall Reading Break? He tries to cut corners, and pisses of the Engineers.
It is with this baggage that Max Holmes now enters the Board of Governors. One of the Board members, about a week ago, unfavorably compared Max's actions to that of the Prime Minister silencing the former Attorney General. How can Max be expected to work with the Board, when they are, presumably, keenly aware his actions over the last two years?
I know exactly what criticism this post might receive. I know that Max and/or his proxies are going to emerge and say that I should post this publicly, with my name attached. They're going to say that I should not rant online, but actually get involved with the AMS. To that, I'm going to say that it is because I am currently involved in student government that I write this anonymously. I currently sit on two committees in departmental and faculty level student societies. I will be hopefully entering a position next year in which I will have to work directly with AMS Executives, and may have to work directly with Max Holmes himself. Given the reputation of Max, I'm sure you would forgive me if I want to write this anonymously.
I know that people are apathetic to the AMS elections. Well, look what happens when you are.","#11416

UBC should fund SASC completely instead of students having to pay more for it. UBC always ""talks"" about mental health and how important it is, they also like to ""talk"" about raising awareness about and helping victims of sexual assault. Enough with just talking, UBC needs to take action. They can't even provide their students with proper support. All they care about is their ""prestigious"" ranking which isnt even based on undergrad stuff.
TLDR: UBC needs to stop pretending like they care and actually do something to help students struggling with their mental health and others who have been victims of sexual abuse/assault/etc.","#11412

It really disturbs me that so many UBC students take people like Ben Shapiro and Laura Southern so seriously that their events get sold out. Like, how can you support such people who spread hate against Muslims? Shapiro has a video that inspired the Quebec mosque shooter talking about how nearly every Muslim is a 'radical' who implicitly supports terrorism. Laura Southern had a video about 'The Great Replacement' - a conspiracy about how white people are getting replaced, the same theory that inspired the Christchurch shooter. How is this even socially acceptable, to casual support such people and click 'going' to their events? What's next, a Facebook event for a Klan Rallly at Chan Center? I'm not advocating for/against deplatforming, I'm just saying it should be socially unacceptable in such a multicultural community for people to openly support such views.","#11411

The struggles of being an active.. single girl in university.
I don’t know if I am the only one who goes through this cycle of letting hook ups happen with people who clearly don’t deserve to know my body like that. It seems that many boys just talk to you and give you attention for the time being being because they want a quick fuck. For myself, some of these people I let in aren’t even random one night stands I meet at parties but friends in the same friend circle/ acquaintances/ people you interact with often. A boy who you may interact on a daily would start talking to you a bit more than usual, and so you give them your attention because attention feels good. You let them flirt a bit, and you flirt back. You give them what they want. You respond to them and feel like you are getting to know them better and enjoy the little chats with them. But right when you let them in and decide to get intimate, they stop talking to you after they get what they want from you. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate the person after something happens but I feel like I was being used, and they only wanted to talk to me more just because they wanted something out of it. It’s not like I catch feelings about the person after but it is a sense of slight regret and inner battle with myself. If I knew they only wanted to hook up, why did I let them in me in the first place? It gets to the point where you can’t seem to stop letting these things happen to yourself. I guess it is the feeling of belonging, security, the warmth of physical touch and feeling valued in the moment- until after it’s over, you realize it was only a temporary feeling and you are left with nothing but yourself and empty notifications on your phone again.","#11409

I don’t feel safe at UBC health wise. There is so much shit wrong with UBC’s medical device protocol, the hospital is a joke, and not to mention the severe lack of a half decent mental health support system (a rant for another time). I am a student who happens to have a heart problem. I will pass out, have a seizure, and can’t function as a human being for a solid three days afterward. The scary thing is, I DON’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO MY HEART WHEN I PASS OUT! Does it stop? Does it slow down? Does it continue in a normal rhythm?
Why don’t I feel safe you ask? Because there is not one AED (the thing that shocks you back to life in all the TV shows) in any of UBC’s residences. Sure they’re on campus, but the closest one to me is a 8 minute walk in a building that is not open 24/7. A) in 8 minutes I would be dead or basically a human vegetable if my heart stopped B) if it happens outside of “operating” hours, I’m fucked either way. I’m scared shitless that it’s going to happen one day and I won’t wake up like I have the three other times that I have passed out and ate shit and I’m going to DIE because a standard medical device that should be available in every building is sitting in some dusty ass box in some building that no one ever goes into.
Get your shit together UBC. Spend the extra money and put AED’s in the residences since you “care so much about your students”. Sad thing is, IF IM DEAD, I CANT SUE YALLS BITCH ASSES.
I would like to get this problem fixed if anyone knows who I should contact about this matter, please help a chick out, thanks!","#11407

Writing in support of #11352 where they called out SUS execs as pre-meds for their resumes.
I got to work with some of the execs this year as their committee member, and some of them were some of the worst people I've worked with. I'm not going to name drop, but either they never showed up to meetings, had no idea what they were even doing, or were just rude to me straight up. Another one of them would always say ""not my problem"" because when shit went wrong for another VP they didn't care because it wasn't related to them. The way some of the others spoke to me sounded so condescending like I'm just asking you a fucking question you don't have to talk to me like I'm 5 years old and don't know how to tie my own damn shoes....
This year's team was one of the most dysfunctional messes I've seen try to work together. Their associate VPs would tell me how they would even fight among themselves because they didn't see eye to eye or had a power struggle. Sounds like monkeys with 1 banana between them trying to figure shit out.. good luck with all your med school apps hope you get rejected xoxo :)","#11403

Biochem PhD here, I'd like to share an experience regarding the arrogance of STEM.
One day, circumstances required that I take a different route to work. I was on my way to the massive, shiny, multimillion dollar building (where my lab is) when I suddenly really needed to piss and walked into the nearest building to find a washroom - which happened to be some Arts building. I don't even know what it's called.
After relieving myself, my curiosity got the better of me and I roamed around a little. The building was very different from the facility I worked in. The spaces were much smaller, though cozier, and it was clear that they haven't had funding for any renovations in a while. The bathroom was nice and clean. The hallways were quiet.
I noticed an active lecture hall. The lecturer was helping a student with something, and everyone else was diligently focused on their work in what seemed to be something reminiscent of a tutorial session. Everyone seemed pretty relaxed, and like they actually had time in the morning to put a clear effort into their appearance. I peeked in and looked at what they were working on.
This experience made me realize three things:
...
////i was surrounded by absolute and utter fucking failure
////ppl really out here paying a couple grand a year just so they could learn some dudes opinions
////our arrogance is completely justified, fuck these goddam pseudointellectual phil douchebros thinking that regurgitating some bullshit about how u can't really know anything is a substitute for actual knowledge
////keep ur fuckin hobbies out of academia but thx for paying for my expensive equipment though lol","#11397

This post can be an unpopular but I will try my best to phrase it nicely so that everyone would understand my problem. I am a Middle-Eastern descent, male, international student, a few days ago I was going back to my residence at night. There happened to be a girl who walked from the same path with me over 10 mins. She was walking ahead of me and after a few minutes of the same path, I think she thought I was following her, she was constantly looking at back in like every 30 seconds, I felt her scare but there was nothing I can do, I was just walking to my residence. Because I thought her that she was uncomfy, I tried to walk faster and pass her, then she scared more and changed her route. To that girl a few days ago, I am really sorry if I scared you but I didnt do anything. I just don't want to be regarded as ""potential rapist"" by my schoolmates that I do not know. I donot know whether this was because of my behaviour, my ethnicity or gender, but this is actually the second time it is happening to me on the campus. I understand the other side as well, hearing/witnessing from the society make them undoubtedly anxious and more cautious. I do not know how to struggle with this prejudgement but being felt as potential criminal from other people, especially in an intellectual atmosphere like UBC makes me feel sad, unconfident and humiliated. I hope I am the only person that faced this and I hope ppl on campus would feel more safer","#11393

I was lining up for coffee at the Tims next to Sauder and overheard two Chinese girls talking in Mandarin. I couldn’t believe what I heard and felt so shame on my own Chinese background.
Apparently, a group/organization is trying to manipulate the course registration system at UBC. They bribe upper years students to register popular courses and sell the seats to students in need. It could get up to $500/seat. The two girls said the university is aware of human involvement but has no idea that the group is using bots as well. The girls then grabbed their coffee, and the conversation just ended there.
This is just wrong at so many levels… I was upset and disappointed with my own community, but at the same time, I can’t do anything about it due to the lack of evidence.

A Sauder Student's Perspective on the Workload of Other Faculties at UBC:
As a Sauder Student studying Finance and balancing Co-op with classes, I can say that my workload is representative of the top quartile in terms of difficulty at Sauder.
But the other day I got to my econ class early (for my econ minor) and the previous class was engineering. AND HOLY SHIT ENG SHIT IS HARD BRO. Like, I could try to understand it but I knew that to use what they were learning, you'd have to practice much more often than the comparatively easy shit you learn here in Sauder.
And honestly, having attended science lectures as well, the workload in Sauder is a joke. The only hard part about Sauder is the sheer quantity of useless bullcrap that you need to come up for classes like HR/OPLOG. Hell even Managerial Accounting was a joke.
So really, whenever I read posts on here about people going through tough times, I really cannot relate. But I'd simply like to let you know that what you're doing is some hard shit and if some egotistical Sauder student comes to you and humble-brags (or however else they like to flex), you can honestly refer them to this post so that they may politely fuck off.","#11373

If UBC has taught me anything, it is that family and health is more important beyond any degree. Many of us (myself included) sacrifice our health to get a ""prestigious"" degree which may end up uselsss. During our studies, we often forget about the important things in life like family. Life sometimes seems too busy for family but make time for them. It really saddens me when I see people treat their friends better than their parents. Friends are important but not as valuable as your parents. I can guarantee you if you got hospitalized, your friends won't take time out of their lives to take care of you but your parents would, without a doubt. All I want to say is take care of your health and cherish your parents. The time we have together is shorter than you realize.","#11370

I feel like my mom doesn't care about me at all, I only get to see my parents once or twice per year because they are in China. and most of the time we just have video or voice chat during weekends. And yet every time when I squeeze out some time from loads of school work and want to have a good chat with them, all my mom asks is how are my grades. I try to talk about how is my life going, and how I planned the summer, and she always say something like if your grades aint good you are not allowed to go anywhere or if you are having any trouble in your life you can only blame yourself. And meanwhile when she is always on vacation and enjoying her retired life (she is not even old), she always talk about how much she sacrificed for me to raise me, and try to give me this impression that I am living my life for her, therefore I should always do what she wants me to do because she gave me birth and guide me to who I am today. People say no matter how tough life is, family will always be on your side, and it just absolutely crushes me when I am all alone in this country and knowing even my dearest family member doesn't even trust me, support me, care about me. I am thankful that at least my dad is a super caring person, and sometimes I ask him to tell my mom about how she should change her attitude, but then my mom will just go crazy and yell at my dad, saying she is not wrong at all and it is me who has the problem.

TLDR; I think one of my close friends is toxic but I don’t know how/if I should end the friendship when it’s one of the only ones I have.
This year I became close friends with these two people which is a big deal for me as I’m slightly introverted and generally have a hard time developing meaningful relationships with others. Everything was going great for the first few months, we were always having fun, hanging out outside of school, and because we are all in the same major there is always something in common to bond over. Once we started getting midterm marks and final grade marks back, one person started to become extremely passive aggressive by always saying things like “fuck you”, “bitch”, “fuck off”, and “dick”, while I am explaining the solution to a question (because they asked me), or talking about some of my recent successes like getting a job or high mark. It comes across jokingly at first but the feeling that it leaves me with is always this underlying negative, angry tone as if it was intended to hurt me. I know some people say things like this to their best friends all the time and it is normal as part of their relationship, but I don’t say things like this to my friends because I don’t want these things said to me. This person even came to my work only to rub in my face that they did better than me on an exam one time. More so, I began to realize that this person is manipulative and has been trying to make me gain weight. We were drinking one night and they kept refilling my glass when I said I didn’t want any more, and always giving me chocolate/putting foods like that on my plate while they don’t eat it themselves. This has happened on multiple occasions. They take advantage of me by always texting me for answers for every single pre-reading quiz (for more than 1 class) and when I do send answers (hours to days later) I am met with no response. Not even a “thanks”. They also recently tried to discourage me from applying for a leadership position which I feel strongly towards because it would require me to be “assertive” and other skills which I apparently don’t possess. I know that I am perfectly capable of a leadership position since I have experience, so I have no idea why this person would be so unsupportive. Every single microaggression that I’ve experienced from them has built up over the past 6 months and I have no idea what to do. I’ve had several mental breakdowns from this person constantly trying to break me and my self esteem, and I have too much pride to let them see that it is working. I don’t want to be apart of this friendship anymore, but it’s one of my only ‘meaningful’ friendships made since coming to UBC. I’m not sure how to be assertive and ask them to stop with the cruel comments, we aren’t THAT close and they might think I’m joking. I’m also not sure how to walk out of a friendship without an extreme amount of drama.","#11362

Every single microaggression that I’ve experienced from them has built up over the past 6 months and I have no idea what to do. I’ve had several mental breakdowns from this person constantly trying to break me and my self esteem, and I have too much pride to let them see that it is working. I don’t want to be apart of this friendship anymore, but it’s one of my only ‘meaningful’ friendships made since coming to UBC. I’m not sure how to be assertive and ask them to stop with the cruel comments, we aren’t THAT close and they might think I’m joking. I’m also not sure how to walk out of a friendship without an extreme amount of drama.",,1552603500,,,35,27,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2343154395702840&id=1287650764586547,

Everyone, please PLEASE put more consideration into your vote!
One of the Engineering clubs went through huge mess this year, because they elected the most irresponsible, selfish President who just want to use it for resume padding, causing their department: 1. Disqualified for e-week (Wonder why you guys didnt have e-week?) 2. Removed from EUS.
She did minimal work on everything. For one of the only things she did: mandatory EUS meetings, she constantly missed them with no reason and eventually got the them voted out of EUS. She kept avoiding responsibilities and justify missing meetings by saying she's on co-op, but did not resign at the time, nor did she do her job as a President. Now she ""resigned"", after messing everything up and leaving everyone else to clean up the mess.
This could happen throughout all clubs across UBC, please put more thought into your vote.","#11357

Tw: suicide
My cousin who went to the University of Toronto committed suicide last week. He was studying computer science. I can't even begin to describe the amount of pain I, my family, and his friends are feeling. Hardly any of us knew he was struggling. I just want to reach out here, even if it helps a single person. Please seek help. Please reach out. You are not alone. UBC has the resources; resources that I believe are made way more available compared to UofT. I reached out to these resources this week in Brock Hall and I am doing okay. The world is still learning and improving our understanding of mental health, so while the systems in place may seem frustrating to some, they are still so important and are doing amazing work. I want everyone to know that depression and suicidal thoughts are nothing to be ashamed of. They are serious with tragic consequences. They are among a wide range of mental illnesses that are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. They are so complex that there is no single way of describing how it may affect you mental and/or physically. My cousin was such a smart, kind, and polite boy. I held him in my arms when he was born. He must have been in so much mental pain, and I couldn't help him. I am devastated, and the lives he touched will never be the same. Please. Please seek help. You are worth it. We are all worth it.","#11356

Every single time we get a light dusting in Vancouver the bus and skytrain is overflowing with people who don't usually take transit (you can tell because they struggle with the complexity of transit. Like tapping your card. Or pulling for stops). But your presence makes the already congested commute so much worse.

As a first generation immigrant, for most of my life I've been immensely grateful for the opportunity to be here in Canada. My parents did all they could so I that could grow up here with the promise of more opportunities.
In recent years, however, I've begun to doubt whether that promise stayed true.
Is being here really worth what my family gave up?
I could've grown up with a network of relatives who support me.
I could've grown up with more money (The exchange rate reduces our income to an average middle-class family).
I could've grown up in a culture that accepted me for who I am.
I envy the rich international students many love to hate. When I see them, I see someone who was given a childhood with financial security, with family support, and absent of racial prejudice. I envy their confidence in their own identity. Part of me wonders if I could be like them had I not come here.
Today a man on the bus told me to ""go back to where I came from"". To be honest, I kind of wish I could. However, I've already lost much of my own culture while trying to fit into one that would never accept me. I don't really belong anywhere anymore.
When I have children, I hope to provide them something I never had: confidence that they are exactly where they should be.","#11351

Today, I was walking through the Nest and was leaning on the glass next to a stairwell on the main floor. By chance, I looked down into the stairwell and I could see a Muslim student praying. You wouldn’t be able to see him just walking by, but I was right along the window and angled so that I could. When I saw him move from sajdah (the position similar to child’s pose but with the head on the floor and hands beside the head) and rise to his knees to complete the prayer, I noticed him wipe tears from his eyes. That brought tears to my own eyes. I left the Nest because I thought I’d cry too. I was appalled that he had to pray in that disgusting stairwell and do it while emotionally distressed.
I am a Moroccan but have spent almost all of my life in North America and do not actively practice the religion myself, so I wasn’t sure if there were any designated prayer zones but after some quick research, I discovered that there is ONE in Brock Hall. Further research reminded me of the vandalism that the interfaith centre received relatively recently and also taught me that this room considered a “safety hazard”; the room is “routinely overfilled during communal prayers and cannot hold its maximum capacity of 60 people. Lack of ventilation has also posed a significant health concern for students, and the location is especially inconvenient for most students to walk to in between classes” (via The Thunderbird). Another search on Reddit provided me with a thread of prayer spaces on campus, the majority of them being stairwells with “low foot traffic” or closets. A very important aspect of Islam prayer is cleanliness and freedom of impurity, which seems impossible in a freaking stairwell.
Since prayer occurs five times per day, one cannot expect a student to walk to Brock Hall five separate times, especially at night in the dark. I understand that some Muslim students feel comfortable praying elsewhere from a designated prayer zone, but for those who do not and make the daily treks to Brock Hall, you deserve better. UBC needs to do better.
So, to conclude, to the guy praying in the stairwell, I’m sorry that you felt the need to have your interaction with Allah in there. I’m sorry that you had to share your emotions on that concrete floor. I hope whatever’s going on gets better.
tl;dr: Muslim students have almost no safe zones to pray on campus and are consequently finding nooks and crannies in various buildings to practice their faith.","#11346

So it's about 8PM at IKB on a Monday and I go to find myself a seat to study for an upcoming midterm. Personally I study best along the hallways on floors 2-4 where the tables and chairs are bar height. I don't know why, but having my feet off the ground puts me in a better head space. So I weave along the floors looking for an empty table and, with no luck as it seems to be an exceptionally busy evening, I situate myself diagonal to a girl sitting alone at a table on the top floor. As soon as I have my iPad ready to go, my notebook and pens/highlighters all lined up, my caffeine and water in position, and my multiple layers of jackets piled up on the chair next to me, the girl pulls out of her bag, A PACK OF DOUBLE BUBBLE GUM. And, holy shit, I knew right then that I had made a mistake of sitting at her table. She proceeded to unwrap a piece and place it in her mouth. And then she began to chew. WITH HER MOUTH WIDE OPEN. And good God it sounded like an extra slobbery makeout session between a couple of horny preteens who have no clue what they're doing. I dove into my bag to get my headphones and I put on an instrumental study playlist as soon as I possible, hoping to mask the moistness of the sound, with no luck at even the highest volume. So here I am listening to K-pop at full blast in hopes that the angelic voices of my idols will drown out the slurping/smooching sounds until this monster packs it in for the evening and I can study in peace.

I’m not his class as I am in csp, but I imagine the science one kids and their luck at being able to see daddy Jim and juicy feet all lecture. I’m glad I’m not in his class or else I’d fail. All I want is his wrinkly toes, specifically his big toe, rubbing on my face.",,1552005660,,,10,110,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2335894236428856&id=1287650764586547,

When my mom told me about this article she read, on how jogging makes people happier, I didn't really believe her, since she always believes stuff from random internet sources.
I don't really remember how I started jogging. I was feeling really down and lonely at the time, so maybe I just really wanted to feel happy and was willing to try something. But either way, I'm glad I did it. Taking a light jog out in the sun always leaves me feeling more relaxed and positive afterwards, and I look forward to all the sunny days now :)","#11321

It saddens me that it took me, similar situations as minorities, for lack of better phrasing, to finally recognize my privilege. It is also disheartening that people act like privilege is a bad word. I’m a white woman, and often, since recently recognizing white privilege, has lead people to think I’m a race traitor, or something of the likes.
To get to the point, it frustrates me when men, and specifically white men, are angry that women and minorities cry racism or sexism, claiming we all face hardships. Of course we all do. But it frustrates me, why are they angry that we are finally speaking out? I know a movie can’t do much, but with the rise of women in large roles like Wonder Woman, however silly of a movie it is, it meant a lot to me as a woman. Whenever women point out that men can’t understand why it feels good, ironically, you see a bunch of men bitching about it. When women ask them why, they do the same thing. They point out that I as a woman should shut up because I can’t understand.
And finally, the worse thing is that some white men and women are talking about how the PC culture is so sensitive. Well, of course. It’s not happening to you. They can’t seem to put themselves in minorities shoes at times, but sometimes want to be in the same position when it suits them. Stop asking for ‘white history month’. You don’t seem to understand why. The whole of Canadian and US history taught in schools has always been about white men, so you want a ‘white history month’? You’d be telling much of the history of Canada.
Stop getting mad at me as the crazy SJW white liberal because I actually recognize this is stolen lands. I don’t speak for minorities, and that’s the point. I’m not guilty, I don’t feel guilty, but I sure as hell know I can never, ever understand their pains, so the least I can do is listen, help and volunteer at shelters, to help in any way I know how to.
TLDR: stop telling women and minorities to stop complaining, and stop acting like racism isn’t that bad because it doesn’t hurt you, stop acting like everyone needs a damn ‘white’ history month or some shit.

I'm a girl who vapes. There are many of us, and we all have our reasons, but I'm wondering if anyone shares my particular reason.
I love cigs. I'm off them now, but whenever I smoked, it was almost always a menthol cigarette. ""Menthols? You like the taste of smoke and mouthwash at the same time?"" Alas, I do not.
The reason I always smoked menthols is because, for reasons I have yet to find an explanation for, whenever I smoked regular cigarettes (e.g., Marlboro Reds), the taste of my vagina changed. Not even joking.
It was a weird, almost mystical phenomenon, and an unpleasant one at that. Has anyone else experienced this? (If any science peeps could also resolve this mystery, the world would make more sense to me. Thanks in advance.)","#11315

You know what their response was aside from scrambling to make it look like they’re doing something? Minimize the statistics, refuse to release the full reports and basically tell us we don’t know what harassment is. And then to boot they gave us all of TWO resources and didn’t even include sasc.

Today, I saw some AMS candidate pull down my friend's club's poster to stick up his poster on the wall. I just want to say to that person, fuck you and I hope you lose.
To be honest, I don't even care if you pull down some other student politician's poster. There was a poster for a club who's events happened 2 weeks ago, why didn't you pull down theirs? If you're going to play politics, then good for you. But keep the other 45,000 students on campus who have better things to do out of it.
You're not so fucking important that you have the right to pull down other people's posters. I went to your website after you left, so I'm just going to explain why you're a hypocrite.
First off, it's not sustainable to print out 1000 fucking posters and stick it up in places with no plans to remove them. Secondly, you don't care about clubs because you obviously care more about having people admire your stoned LinkedIn picture. And third, you're not accountable at all if you feel like you can go around doing whatever you want, and it's sketchy as hell when one of your 3 promises for accountability is that you'll reply to our emails like a normal person (like are you serious?).
Fuck the AMS elections. Fuck the AMS for openly encouraging people to do shit like this. Don't you all have better things to do, like study?","#11301

My dad has always been the biggest hero in my life. He has sacrificed anything and everything to ensure that our family is happy and taken care of. He is incredibly caring and goes out of his way to do favours for old friends. Lately though, I worry about him. It feels as if he is constantly sad, but masking it by pretending to be his jolly self. I figure he's hiding something from us.
I overheard him talking to my mom and mentioning that aside from our family ""he has no one."" I can't even begin to describe how painful this was to hear. I also overheard him on the phone, I don't know the specifics but I do know that he cancelled an appointment with a ""specialist"" because it cost too much. I'm not sure but I'm guessing it was a mental health specialist?
I want to talk about it with him, but there's this stigma surrounding mental health in asian culture, and it's seldom talked about. This is compounded by the fact that he likely wouldn't want me to lose focus on my studies and worry about him. But I'm already worried about him. I want to be there for my dad, and I have no idea how I can do that, and at this point it's all I can focus on.","#11290

I commuted for 4 years and couldn't for the life of me find a community I liked or felt comfortable with. Religious clubs, clubs related to what I was studying, people who had the same hobbies, etc.
Come to this year, I've found the most amazing people who live in my building/in the same area. I had given up on looking, and ended up finding people who are so much like me that it's scary. My friends don't know how much having them around means to me, and I'm terrified because April is coming up. We're all going different places (and graduating) so I'll probably never be with them again.
Point is, it takes a lot of trial, error, and time. Maybe the right people for you aren't around yet. Maybe you're not just in a transition period like I'll be in a couple months. Maybe it's just not time, that's ok too. But somewhere out there are people who are gonna be right for you - until you find them, there's always people to chat with around campus. Y'all aren't always alone.","#11286

The thing I'm most looking forward to about spring is finally seeing the end of those multi-coloured sheep-like fuzzy jackets; it seemed like they were everywhere last semester (I tried counting but I fell asleep). While I appreciate their warming properties and the fact that they make for a cheap Boohbah cosplay, I can only imagine the casualties if sheepdogs were released on campus...","#11285

I met my girlfriend when she was crying and looked stressed during midterms last term and I thought in a non creepy and non sexual way approach her (I would be lying though if I said she wasn’t so cute looking) and ask if she was alright and she said no and wanted to talk so I listened to her and made her feel better. Fast forward final seasons in December she messages me and wants to talk (I left my contact saying reach out whenever you want to talk) and so I agreed because I as a socially awkward loner guy wanted to talk to. And then in January we talked more and now I am dating her. Moral of the story: be nice to girls and guys you see stressed :)","#11283

I feel like this NEEDS to be posted as recently I’ve read some disturbing, disheartening, selfish replies to recent depression and suicidal UBC Confessions submissions.
Some people seem to be under the impression that submissions of depressing nature should be censored and filtered out or moved to their own segregated “depression page” because it makes them feel uncomfortable or depressed themselves. Fuck you, go fuck yourself asshole.
Reading other peoples’ struggles on this page and reading kind and supporting comments from a plethora of people has literally saved my life, twice.
Segregating these submissions would only serve to signal to people struggling that their issues are a burden to everyone around them and that they should just shut up and deal with it. That’s wrong. If you believe in that horseshit, know this: you are part of the problem. Learn some fucking empathy,
It absolutely infuriates me whenever I see or hear this kind of shit, and I hope that the admins of this page realize the GOOD impact that they are making by allowing a forum to exist for UBC students and pretty much everyone else to anonymously air their grievances. Please do not ever censor or exclude these posts. You should be proud of yourselves for doing this.
This page is a better support system than UBC’s incompetent official lines of “help” and “resources”.
The university is highly incompetent due to the fact that it’s near the top of the food chain in regards to institutions in Canada and publically regarded as the top in BC. What I mean by this is that the university KNOWS that it will not have a shortage of applicants and tuition revenue flowing in, so it completely disregards the mental health support that CURRENT students need in favour of pushing those students out to make room for new students. Realistically, it’s simply not worth the university’s time to provide any MEANINGFUL aid and resources to current students that are struggling with life for various reasons simply because that student is one amongst thousands and can be easily replaced by a new freshie from highschool.
UBC seriously needs to take a look at the submissions on this page, step back, and realize that the university simply is not doing enough. Referring people to XYZ is simply not enough. Asking people to withdraw and reapply when they’re in a better mental health state is asinine. You need to create policies and procedures on how to better support current students.","#11281

I'm an Asian girl and the amount of shit that I've gotten from both Asian girls and white dudes for saying ""I prefer dating Asian guys"" is insane. I'm not even saying ""I only date Asian guys."" I have a preference, but I'm not opposed to any race. Other Asians just happen to have similar values and experiences that I gravitate towards in a relationship.
Some of my Asian girlfriends get mad at me for being ""racist"" for ""excluding other races"" no matter how many times I try to explain. Meanwhile they're over here telling me how ""I don't date Asian men because they're not masculine enough"" or ""they have small dicks"" and other excuses they tell me to cover up their blatant racism. It's funny because they never date other races--only white. I always ask them why they are so racist towards their own race and point out the hypocrisy of telling me to include all races when they exclude Asian men in their dating pool solely based on unbased, racist claims.
A white man told me to ""breakup with my Asian boyfriend"" because he can ""give me a better time"" and that my ""boyfriend can't satisfy me since he has a small dick."" Like seriously wtf. I'm trying to mind my own business and spend time with my boyfriend and you have the nerve to come up to us and say that to our faces? You cannot believe the amount of times I am approached in public by white men indoctrinated by the whole ""Asian women are submissive creatures"" belief. I could use all of the digits on my hands and feet to count them, but even then, it wouldn't be enough. They think it's ok to come up to me and call me an ""oriental princess"" or ""miss Saigon"". Some even proceed to try to touch me. They get shocked when I yell at them to ""fuck off"" because that's ""not supposed to happen."" I'm supposed to be ""their cute little Asian girl.""
I understand that not all Asian women and white men are like this. It's just prevalent enough that it's a problem. The systemic emasculation of Asian men and fetishization of Asian women needs to stop. Similarily the trope of the ""white saviour"" needs to stop. You may think that it doesn't matter, but coming from first hand experience I was almost assaulted IN PUBLIC for rejecting one of these advances. Multiple times.The girls in my country are being sold away to sexpats who believe in the ""Asian girls in the third world are easy"" trope.
I am not your ""dragon lady"" or ""oriental princess."" Don't call me a ""gook"" or ""chink"" because I refuse to fit into your version of what an Asian is. Don't you dare call my men ""ladies"" or claim that they have ""baby dicks."" I am more than just the stereotype of my race. To other Asian women, refuse to tolerate this bullshit. To Asian men, the same.","#11267

Trigger warning - Rape, long confession
So this is the story of how my girlfriend raped me. And I’m a guy.
I remember coming home and my girlfriend said she got something to try out. And it was a strap on dildo. So I asked here “my dicks not bad is it?” Because there’s the first place my brain went. And then she said “it’s not for you, silly! It’s for to get up in you for a change!” Perplexed, I said “you’re gonna stick that up my ass?” Because that’s something that has always made me queasy. And she said “of course! Now get over her and lie down!” She proclaimed while putting it on. I had a long day and wasn’t in the mood for regular sex, so let alone this. I declined and sat down in bed to play some Xbox and travel to Surfers Paradise in Gold Coast, Australia in some Forza Horizon 3. She acknowledged and sat next to me, still wearing that dildo, but I didn’t think much of it.
But as night fell and I rolled over to go to sleep is when it happened. I felt her hands turn me on my belly and my pants come off while was half asleep with my face buried in the pillow. And by the time I realized what was going on, it was way to late. I felt a searing pain as I felt that rubber cock ram my asshole, the most uncomfortable feeling I felt. I should add that I hold my morals very seriously and I would never hit a woman. But there was nothing I could do on my belly but struggle. I remember gasping for air, crying and sobbing openly, groaning in pain, whispering in agony “please stop, it hurts”. And all she just said was “sshhhhhhh” in a really low pitched voice that was unmistakably hers. In the dim light, I could see her wanking herself off as she held me down and screwed me.
At that point I realized there was nothing I could do. I let my muscles go limp and had no choice but to wait until whatever she was doing had run it’s course. After she was done, she kissed my cheek and rolled over and went to sleep whispering “I love you”. The only thing I could think do was sneak out, and I did. I crashed at my best friends house.
So the reason I’m turning to UBCC is because I don’t know what to do. Who will believe me?? I thought I loved this girl, she was my soulmate and I hoped to marry her one day and then she goes and violates me like this. Who can I speak to? Do I call the police?","#11266

Here's the story of another eng kid who wants to drop out but the tale I'm about to tell is a bit different than most.
I'm here on my own accord. My parents never pressured me to go into eng or anything, they were nothing but excited for me and support me. I'm also here on scholarship so it seems like everything should be perfect. My dream career is to become an engineer as I truly love the field of study and what I can do with the degree in terms of the types of jobs I could do. Though something doesn't feel right.
Everyday I find myself just hating what I'm doing and myself. I skip class constantly, telling myself that I can catch up on my own though I chegg pretty much everything. I procrastinate everything as far as I can and instead I spend most of my time in bed feeling shitty. But the thing that's been bothering me the most is that I'm here not because anyone has any expectations of me being here or because of any other reason than I want to me. But I don't think I want to be here anymore.
The kicker is that if I leave for a year, I lose my scholarship. That's something huge to be giving up to ""find myself"" and ""get myself ready"" or do some shit like
""learn who I am and learn to love myself so that I can motivate myself to succeed"".
I know that the solution in the end is to grab my balls and push through it, learn those things as I study but the motivation is gone. I'm sad and lost. I spent the reading break with friends, having a great time. Though since we've split to get back to work, I've been back to my old routine. I don't even really know why I'm writing this confession but I just kinda wanted to get this off my chest. Is anyone feeling or felt like this? What do I do?","#11263

UBC people need to chill with the networking and/or get better at it - I was at a conference recently (I'll keep it ambiguous for anonymity) but in sum the event was composed of professionals and graduate students. The professionals and graduate students were there for a competition and network, and there were a handful of undergraduates (myself included) there to help out. Unfortunately, there were a couple undergrads from UBC who seemingly exclusively volunteered to ""network""(?) and went as far as to literally tell me to leave their table so they'd be able to talk with some of the professionals (they didn't do so much as glance at the graduate students), and honestly hearing them talk to the professionals was so uncomfortable because the professionals were clearly there to speak with the next generation of their profession (its a profession that requires a graduate degree) and the undergrads just couldn't take a hint?? I befriended several of the graduate students which lead to me introducing me to a couple of professionals mainly because I was/am very genuine and the same undergrads who has disavowed me for simply saying that I was there to help out see the event and perhaps stumble into an interesting conversation appeared behind me and tried to take over the conversation which made literally all of us uncomfortable (one started stating every fact under the sun about herself) to the point that I ended up having to basically walk her away from the conversation and not so subtly tell her that this isn't our event & that were/are there to help not dominate the event. I understand that some student watch this stuff in online tutorials on ""how to network"" but if you have nothing to offer (and be realistic with yourself - are your skills/background actually relevant?) then chill, listen, learn & engage!

UBC people need to chill with the networking and/or get better at it - I was at a conference recently (I'll keep it ambiguous for anonymity) but in sum the event was composed of professionals and graduate students. The professionals and graduate students were there for a competition and network, and there were a handful of undergraduates (myself included) there to help out. Unfortunately, there were a couple undergrads from UBC who seemingly exclusively volunteered to ""network""(?) and went as far as to literally tell me to leave their table so they'd be able to talk with some of the professionals (they didn't do so much as glance at the graduate students), and honestly hearing them talk to the professionals was so uncomfortable because the professionals were clearly there to speak with the next generation of their profession (its a profession that requires a graduate degree) and the undergrads just couldn't take a hint?? I befriended several of the graduate students which lead to me introducing me to a couple of professionals mainly because I was/am very genuine and the same undergrads who has disavowed me for simply saying that I was there to help out see the event and perhaps stumble into an interesting conversation appeared behind me and tried to take over the conversation which made literally all of us uncomfortable (one started stating every fact under the sun about herself) to the point that I ended up having to basically walk her away from the conversation and not so subtly tell her that this isn't our event & that were/are there to help not dominate the event. I understand that some student watch this stuff in online tutorials on ""how to network"" but if you have nothing to offer (and be realistic with yourself - are your skills/background actually relevant?) then chill, listen, learn & engage!

I'm gonna be honest when I first heard an Asian speak coherent English, I was in disbelief. I'd never seen anything like that back where I came from. As a white South African, I only expected white people to speak correct English, or sometimes the Indians. It's a trippy experience for me when I cross paths with an Asian student, her ability in speaking English is as good as mine but she ...looks..... Chinese, or Japanese or you get it. It makes me feel out of place but then I also wonder how much they know their own language - Mandarin. Did they give up their culture to try to fit in Canada's culture? I can tell you that as a white South African, I've always cherished my African country and European ancestry, and I proudly call myself a South African who belongs to Africa.","#11253

Recently a movie set built a wall on Main Wall. In my opinion we have to BUILD THAT WALL! We are being invaded by radical arts students. They are bringing unemployment, they are bringing unemployment, they are bringing a winter reading break they are hipsters. AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE BUCHANAN PAY FOR IT. That ugly building is degrading our way of life and it will be happy to pay for it. These radical arts students are an eye sore to us engineers as we strut around in our elitism, one million courses and pride. Trust me, if any art students comment on this, the wall just got 10 feet higher, trust me.

Unpopular opinion, but studying with friends is possibly the worst thing ever. In my experience, it is impossible to study EFFICIENTLY especially when you bring a large group with you. Oh god especially at the round tables in IKB. The moment I look up from my laptop I’m facing one of my friends. The moment each and every one of them look up from the laptop they are facing another friend. And since we are all good friends the mere gaze of one another entices shits and giggles. It’s honestly a fucking unit circle of procrastination. Even though some people try to focus there are always at LEAST 2 people who 1) do dumb shit with each other and end distracting everyone or 2) make everyone do dumb shit with them. Yeah sounds like I’m complaining when the solution is right in front of me but unfortunately I love my friends so much that I want to spend every hour of the day with them AND it’s impossible to mute them with earbuds because they aren’t technologically advanced enough to mute the wheezing coming out my friends’ mouths when they see a dog meme. Therefore I conclude the solution to good grades is to not have friends. The end.","#11235

Everyone in this university seems at least mildly mentally ill. From narcissism to depression. It really fucks with me and makes me feel depressed myself. I’m in my 4th year at UBC, the serious lack of empathy needs to be addressed. It’s obviously a systemic issue that goes beyond the university, but the shitty mental health services and the cold student culture doesn’t help. I don’t regret coming here and have had an amazing 4 years overall, but at the same time it’s been a very disheartening environment.
Be nice to your fucking friends ffs. Smile at people and treat them respectfully. And I don’t even mean it in a sing along kumbaya feel good bullshit type of way. Just some common decency, treat people as you’d like to be and maybe we can have a cheerier campus where people don’t cry in libraries and post suicide notes on this page.
I’m torn between leaving or staying in this toxic environment because I love my friends, my comfortable lifestyle that suits me and the nature. But the cynical overtly political side of myself just thinks this is what any neoliberal alienated society is gonna be like so there may be no point.
Anyway, I steered away from the point. Point is, be respectful to your peers and Santa Ono stop talking about how you suffered from mental illness and actually start fixing the shitty services you provide us with our scam of a tuition.","#11234

The UBC writing center is becoming more and more useless after the change of the manager and the tutor's team. I still memorize when I went to the center last year, the appointment was full. However, this year, most of the space are empty and only a few students go there. I asked them to read through my article and help me with the grammatical issue. The tutors said we do not help problems with grammar. I want to ask the tutors: if you don't help with the grammar, what can you actually support for students? Let's say I have an econ paper, are you guys more knowledgable and professional about Econ than I am? What is your function? what is the point I come to the writing center instead of writing by myself? Maybe I should meet more tutors and see if they have the same attitude. But the two I've met there really make me annoyed. I also hope to open up the limit of the appointment each week. Can you see most of the tutors have no work to do and sit there for several hours and get the salary? It's a waste of budget and public resources. If the writing center doesn't improve, I would suggest to close down the writing center and put the money to other programs.","#11233

Trigger warning: Suicidal thoughts
(If the grammar sounds bad, I am sorry, I'm trying to be as vague as possible while still giving context because I don't want anyone to know)
I used to be in sciences, but now switched to arts. I went into sciences because that was what my parents wanted. I switched, much to their anger, but I switched nonetheless. But I don't feel any happier. I am getting so much pressure from them. In a way, I am so mad at them. They tell me about how I am supposed to 'grow up, wake up that the real world isn't about doing what I love and I should find something that gets me a good job'. And you know what, maybe they were right. But what irks me is that they don't seem to realize that growing up also means making your own decisions, and yet, they can't seem to let me do that.
I'm so frustrated and sad.
I'm Asian, and I hate how this sounds, but I hated being Asian. I always asked why I couldn't be like the Canadians, why my parents couldn't be like the Canadians, supporting their children's decisions. I can't even get a job because my parents believe that school is everything. To them, any time I have time for a break, it means I have time to study some more. Sometimes, I think the Asian mentality is why suicide is so high in Korea, why Japan has people literally working themselves to death.
I guess I should be grateful they feed me and everything, but I can't help but think about the Indian guy who wants to sue his parents. I don't think I'll ever sue my parents, but, I really wish people would hear us out. I never asked to be born. Why must I be born only to be molded into a person my parents want? They can't seem to understand letting people have freedom. It's sad because people can't admit they are having kids for themselves. It's stupid people talk about 'continuing humanity'. Like so fucking what. You had me so when you grow old someone will be there for you. You didn't have me for me, you had me for yourselves.
They tell me they do give me freedom, because I am doing what I want in arts anyways. But the sad thing is, they don't understand that just because they aren't physically stopping me, their constant disapproving lectures is in away, a force that is trying to push me one way or another.
Because of all this stress, I've been addicted to call of duty (lame I know, but it relieves so much stress). And they blame me. I know it's unhealthy, yet they tell me my addiction is my own fault, which just gives me more stress. I wish they would understand that if they really want me to be better they should just leave me alone.
I wish there was some sort of positivity in this, but I can't see it. I am sorry for the long confession, but I am constantly crying at night. I've mastered silent tears. Yet, every day I think of death. The irony is, the only reason why I haven't killed myself is, no matter how selfish they are, I don't feel selfish enough to leave my parents alone as they grow old.
I think my mind will break. I want to die. I fantasize of all the ways to do it, yet I can't even find the courage to self harm, to watch myself bleed.","#11226

To the people studying Forestry:
Evac that garbage RIGHT NOW, 4 years into the industry i can tell you a number of things:
1. The pay is absolute trash for the amount of suffering to you do. We're talking frozen hands in the winter from trying to tie ribbon when your employer forces you out into -35 with windchill weather or being stuck babysitting adult children (logging contractors) with no respect for forest health or the public interest.
2. The Industry is just as unstable if not more than any other natural resource industry, despite paying absolute trash in comparison (starting wage is 18 dollars an hour compared to 35 for mining and 45 for oil). Your wage will likely never exceed 90,000 a year and your company will likely go bankrupt before you get to take advantage of the pensions.
3. You are forced to live in some of the shittist towns known to man, with some of the most racist, intolerant pieces of garbage on the planet. The amount of ""Drunk chug"" or ""damned indian"" jokes I've had to hear over the years is beyond ridiculous. Also, there are usually no single people in those towns (or worse, the camps you get sent to) that aren't 35+ or have a kid already, so good luck dating!
4. Despite the Whole ""saving the forest"" joke that profs and the ABCFP like to push, when you FINALLY become forester (After 2 years of the driest material known to man, and the most arbitrary of tests), your company will offer you no room or time to innovate and you will be stuck signing and stamping CLEARCUTS for the rest of your sorry existence.
TLDR; Forestry is an underpaying, toxic and thoroughly disappointing industry to be apart of, you make no difference in the world and you are better off dropping the degree to go studying something that while equally likely to wreak the world, at least you will get payed handsomely for it.","#11223

Okay so first off I know this is gonna sound like shitty as fuck, but I need to get this out in the open. So today was laundry day, so I had all of my laundry in the machine, which I left unattended because midterm season. Now, I know that it is kinda dicky to leave your clothes in the washing machine for a long time, but five CUNTING MINUTES is not long enough for SOME BITCH TO COME IN AND TAKE MY SHIT OUT OF THE FUCKING MACHINES. I don't get even. I get even with interest. They sent my clothes out, so I drown theirs. I swear I am not normally the type of person to make a mess, but DONT. TOUCH. MY. FUCKING. STUFF. In my mind all I heard was RAGE RAGE FUCKING RAGE. I pulled the plug on the washing machine after kicking it several times, then focused my attention on my own laundry, cuz you know, I got shit to do. Anyway, a few minutes later, I notice Niagara falls forming at the base of the glass bowl of the laundry machine I had sabotaged. Oops. I ignored it for a while, but eventually a puddle had formed, and my curiosity got the better of me. Imagine, if you will, how the Egyptians who followed Moses through the red sea felt just as the sea closed on them. Or how Jack felt in the ending of titanic as he was submerged in the icy waters of the Atlantic. The torrent of water that shot from that machine was like some old testament cleansing. I tried to close the door, but a towel flew out along with another couple oceans worth of water, and I fell back, sure as I am standing here now that I was actually being waterboarded by the CIA in some black site. Anyway, I come to my senses and climb on top of the washing machine, using my clever physics know how to avoid getting my feet wet, but in the process of closing the door, I managed to spray myself in the face with bleach water. With the door finally closed, I walked from the scene, like an action hero walking away from an explosion, but soaking wet and in my PJ's. In summary, I am the laundry room god, and any who test me will feel my wrath.","#11217

I was surprised that the manager did not ask them to leave or call the cops on them for actually mishandling the place’s property. They then left after eating their pizza, trashing the floor with shit everywhere and jump kicking the glass door to the restaurant. In what scenario is that funny and people like these should be behind bars for the literal mayhem the caused in the restaurant.

tw sexual abuse
One time when I was about 7 years old my family and I went to visit one of my father's acquaintance's house. While the ""parents"" were chatting, the hosts told me to go and play with their children who were in high school/university at the time. When I went to their room, they opened porn in front of me and started jacking off to 3D furry hentai, which I unfortunately still remember quite vividly. As I didn't know what was going on, I asked them what this was about and they told me it was ""grown-up stuff"", and we could try it if I wanted to. I don't really remember what happened afterwards, but I like to believe it was nothing bad. I didn't really realise what had happened until I was in high school, and then it was too late.","#11205

BIE is probably the most scam faculty I've ever seen, why pay double so you can learn the same shit from GENERAL ECON. If you're a real economist, the benefit and cost analysis shows you that if you're in BIE you are making an irrational decision. With fees of around 10k a year, the better option is obviously Sauder, better job co-ops, more related financial and business courses etc, better networking events and people to meet. BIE does not provide that, but you pay the same fees LOL. General Econ falls underneath the faculty of Arts, so already if you're there, it's kinda like a ghetto. There's three outcomes from General Arts, you either hustle yourself and find good jobs yourself and NOT through Arts Co-op because it's an absolute shit fest (you only get volunteer work or charity bullshit, nothing financial related if you're in Econ); OR have dad/mom get you into a position and all you gotta do is have a degree, in which that case BIE would still be an irrational decision because if all you need is a degree and Sauder isn't an option, to ""buy a degree"" so you can work through connections is cheaper through Arts; OR you literally wasted 4 years and you have no relevant job experience, or any experience at all, and you have to go to another school that will accept you for business ie. SFU BCIT etc. From what I see this is some elaborate scam that UBC Econ has come up with which exploits an immature kid's pride and ego to ""separate themselves"" from general arts, but are too underachieved to go to business school. In the end you're just fooling yourselves and getting used by those old misers in Econ who simply do all this to collect school fees.
Went on this rant because a friend of mine in G.A. graduated this year and got hired to M.S Financials, all his BIE friends started getting salty claiming he wasn't ""really a business student"".

TW: sexual assault
I don’t understand how the AMS and UBC can handle sexual assault without the police getting involved. It makes no sense to me. “Under section 22 of the Criminal Code of Canada, if an individual has an awareness of a crime because they have witnessed the crime or have been told that the crime has occurred, and by not reporting this crime to the police service or other relevant agency, this individual is in some way aiding or abetting the crime to take place, they may be charged with counselling an offence.” If they are told of these crimes and don’t inform the police isn’t that criminal? If someone was fucking raped that’s a very serious crime. It needs to be reported. I don’t see why it is an option to report it or not. If I witnessed or someone confessed to me that their friend was murdered, it’s my job to report it. Why is assault different?","#11197

So I finally got the courage to ask the girl I’ve been crushing on since December to go on a date today. And she said no. I’m regretting so hard not doing this earlier, not saving myself from the literal hours of anguish and hope and stress I’ve put myself through, as I’ve quietly and respectfully become her friend and gotten closer and closer to her. And now here I am, making our friendship dynamic weird and adding this weight between us. Hopefully she doesn’t hold this against me and we can still be buds and enjoy our time together. I’m so embarrassed and all I can do is kick myself for not doing this earlier. It took all my strength to be understanding and keep the smile on my face as she was rejecting me. But at the same time, I’m so glad I did it. I’m so glad it’s off my chest and I don’t have to worry about ambiguous nights out and texts back. Now I’m free to just be. Cut the heartstring, move on. To all those out there who are beating themselves up over asking someone out, just do it. Maybe it won’t work! But at least you’ll know and be able to move your heart on. Best of luck to all of you. ❤️","#11179

TL;DR: If you have a problem say it. Don’t be a coward and don’t throw your identity around as an insult.
I was sitting in a dinning hall with my friends on a Monday night. Midterms are on the horizon, tensions are high and honestly we needed a good break. We’re having fun laughing very loud, we recognize a few people walking by, they sit with us, we laugh even louder and they leave.
Mid conversation I happen to catch a glint of light out of the corner of my eye coming from the next table over. So I turn to look and I see that the people sitting on there have a Surface open and turned at the edge to the space between our tables. At first confusion washes over me. Why would these ppl just have a computer chilling in front of no one, literally facing out their table? And then I realize that it’s opened to a word doc and in big fat letters it says “This table of latinos would prefer if you didn’t...”.
It took me a second to realize they were talking about us TO US and lemme tell you, I felt my blood boil with the ire of the fifth circle of hell. And I honestly could't tell why their identity was even in the question here? Did they overhear me talking about being South American myself and were using my own identity to attack me or were they just doing it unknowingly? Either way WHO DOES THAT?? So I turn to my two friends and tell them, and immediately we drop our voices so we can talk about them. When I look back the word doc is gone and replacing it is a gif of a sparkly handwritten “Gracias”, then I notice they were laughing about it and making fun of the things we were talking about previously. At that point I was ready to throw hands at these bitches.
My Canadian friend managed to calm me down and after being as loud as possible out of spite I managed to walk away delivering only the dirtiest look I could muster. No hands thrown.
Now this is to you 3 fellow latinos: YA’LL ARE FUCKING COWARDS.
A) there are very nice group study rooms available just downstairs if you want a quieter space than the caf and B) really?? you don’t have the guts to, I don’t know, come up and politely ask us to tone it down?? Because if you did we would have.
Dishonour on you. Dishonour on your family. Dishonour on your cow. You bring dishonour to the entirety of Latin America.
Have a good day fuckers.","#11173

I find it so funny when people make fun of Vancouver for “freaking out” about the snow like yooo chill, just cuz you’re from Ontario and you’re stuck inside cuz it’s too cold to be outside doesn’t mean u should prance around with so much pride saying “oh this is nothing, you should see what everyone at my home town deals with” NEW FLASH: NO ONE CARES. We don’t get snow here very often so when it does come not everyone is prepared. Out east it is a regular occurance but it isn’t here. So it’s pretty obvious why our buses and schools might shut down becuase no one expected it or has snow tires etc. A lot of people around the city try their best to deal with the conditions yet some people complain about it endlessly. Well to them I say: grow up and be thankful for where you are and what you have. (Personally I would way rather be here than somewhere where you freeze after one minute outside)","#11171

Okay time to rant.
Everyday I wake up in the morning, ready to go about my day and have a good time. Then it hits me. THE THOUGHT OF GUM UNDER EVERY SINGLE SEAT IN CIRS. I have many questions. First, WHY do people do this? It's so disgusting. Seriously? Can't they just chew the gum for like ten more minutes and then throw it in the trash? People will go above and beyond to keep the environment clean and then they do shit like this. Also, why aren't the lecture rooms cleaned every day? Not like UBC has shortage of money to pay for cleaning.
Today I went to class a bit late and had to maneuver my way to get a seat. There were five empy seats in a row. ALL of them had gum under the seats and desks, not even one piece of gum but SEVERAL. Some of them were stretched out. The visual of someone taking out the gum from their mouth, sticking it under the desk/seat AND THEN SQUISHING IT MORE, makes me want to throwup.

I know this will get me killed more so than any thing else like being a Trump supporter or whatever... But I hate the UBC Vancouver cultural obsession.
It's fine to find the main campus cool. But it's weird as fucking fuck to be obsessed with it. Like, the main campus lovers act like their life revolves around it. If I acted like my life revolved around UofT St. George or some shit, people will find it weird. So I really don't get why people are okay with the weird as fucking fuck UBC Vancouver obsession. Plus the UBC Tree Shadow and Engineer's Cairn are a horrendous eye sore and a sorry excuse for art. Most of the Sauder students are just using each other for their personal benefits and slither around like snakes and make ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°) faces whenever they see someone without airpods. The engineering students are ok with me though. but the campus, like a lot of other Canadian campus's, makes my eyes bleed. No skytrain connection, not much variation in the buildings, horrible automobiles and no longer organic. Student drama? Like a lot of asian dramas, what is this shit? the stupid cliches, the weird ass, almost sexist, abusive story lines... no thanks. /sorry not sorry, end rant. lol","#11128

If I acted like my life revolved around UofT St. George or some shit, people will find it weird. So I really don't get why people are okay with the weird as fucking fuck UBC Vancouver obsession. Plus the UBC Tree Shadow and Engineer's Cairn are a horrendous eye sore and a sorry excuse for art. Most of the Sauder students are just using each other for their personal benefits and slither around like snakes and make ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°) faces whenever they see someone without airpods. The engineering students are ok with me though. but the campus, like a lot of other Canadian campus's, makes my eyes bleed. No skytrain connection, not much variation in the buildings, horrible automobiles and no longer organic. Student drama? Like a lot of asian dramas, what is this shit? the stupid cliches, the weird ass, almost sexist, abusive story lines... no thanks. /sorry not sorry, end rant. lol",,1550001601,,,23,20,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2301239023227711&id=1287650764586547,

Recently I've seen a lot more animal activists, and Men's Rights groups set up outside the Nest. Each time there is a healthy amount of people engaging in debate and dialogue with them, although I haven't actually joined in the debates I think its great that students engage with the issues.
What surprises me, however, is that essentially nobody debates the presence of Catholic Church associations or Chinese Nationalist associations and their presence on campus. These are organizations that have regularly permitted serious crimes against humanity on a systematic, institutionalized basis, ranging from pedophilia, sex slavery, torture, extra-judicial killings, suppression of free speech, political imprisonment and a long litany of other human rights abuses. This applies to both groups, right up to the modern day.
People say 'but most Catholics aren't pedophiles, and most Chinese nationalists don't participate in censorship, forced labor camps, etc'... Well, most meat-eaters don't slaughter caged animals, and most Men's Right's activists don't rape women. But the argument always is, by supporting these organizations you become complicit in their actions.
Double standard much? Or am I taking crazy pills?","#11127

UBC's mental health services are a fucking joke. For a school that advocates for their services and how important mental health is, its enraging what you have to go through to actually see someone.

Nobody takes me seriously when I say this but I legitimately think BC should build a wall on the border with Alberta and force people from Alberta to go through a strict vetting process.
Back when Alberta's economy went down the shitter and a ton of Albertans moved to BC, the crime rate slowly went up here. In my neighbourhood, there were a couple of incidents committed by Albertans that traumatized me. You could bet when something bad happened, it was probably an Albertan. Plus, Albertans are rude. We had that trade dispute with them too. They are criminals, idiots, and just all around bad people. Maybe once Alberta cleans up their act we can let them into our province but until then we should ban Albertans from entering BC.
People who go to University of Alberta are cool though.","#11100

Trigger Warning: Homophobia, Violence, Emotional Abuse
I'm recently applied for UBC. Is it wrong that I want to go east to get away from my parents?
It's just that my parents can be described as stereotypical immigrant parents: petty, dismissive, and unwilling to listen to you unless they like what you are trying to say. Fortunately, things changed in high school and my parents, sister and I built up a great, trusting relationship.
Unfortunately, this year a loved family member passed away and my sister and I witnessed our family fall apart as we were mediators for every conflict. This took a huge emotional and physical toll on both of us, especially my sister, having not witnessed the extent of their anger and disappointment. My parents reverted to who they were before and it's painful knowing that we all worked so hard, only for an event that should unite a family tear it apart.
Now, both my parents hold in either of us and treat us as such. For example, I was trying to work on an essay for a scholarship but my father blocked my room. I asked him to move out of the way and he refused, even pushing me into a wall as I tried to move around him to my laptop. It feels as though my parents forgot we existed. I also told my parents that I would like to study in the east, but then they would try to gaslight me, saying that ""I don't care about them"" and ""would gladly leave them, given the chance to"". The main issue about this and why it affected me so much is that I do love them, but living in a constant warzone is becoming exhausting and saddening, knowing what it was once before.
I really want to leave, as the school I applied for is my dream school but it's no longer my dream because of the program, just the prospect of leaving my parents. Is it wrong for me to want to leave them after everything that happened? I'm scared that if I do leave, it would give them even more reason to hate me and neglect us. The one messed up part of it is that even though I know I'll be happy and unburdened, I can't help but feel guilty for leaving my sister, who's still in high school, in a toxic household. I saw how badly they treated her for no apparent reason and how the past few months tore her apart. I'm scared that if I do leave her, her anxiety will eat her alive and I fear for her safety.
Another thing is that I'm gay and my parents are both homophobic and not accepting of LGBTQ2IA+ people. I just feel unsafe being in the house with them, knowing that I could easily give them something to use against me. Going home after school almost feels wrong, like I'm returning to a cage. I know that I will be safer if I move away, but I feel like if I'm leaving my sister behind, I'm obligated to stay and protect her.
Honestly this has become a huge mess and I don't know whether I should stay or go. I appreciate any advice given in comments.
TLDR: Send help, I really want to leave province due to my parents' abusive tendencies, but I don't want to leave my sister behind.","#11085

Trigger warning:
To be honest I hate that whole bell lets talk thing cause it doesn’t do shit. As a person who suffers from a mental illness (anxiety attacks) I tried to be open about it with my friends because I needed someone to talk to. It just ended up them getting more and more distance(or at least that how it feels) and just being plain hurtful. I try to be honest and I have been healing and reflecting but that was all on my own. Saying that going out and talking to someone doesnt always help cause you don’t know how that person will react. To be honest it did make my condition worse but i got better. It just pisses me off to see those exact people posting that bell lets talk stuff when in reality they shouldn’t be the ones talking. Sorry for this rant it’s just too much bullshit.","#11078

I grew up in Vancouver and chose to go to UBCO, and I must admit that UBC’s Point Grey campus is a great institution. The class sizes are bigger, there are less opportunities to connect with profs and you’re able to not get the benefits of a smaller university. That being said, I have a lot of friends who go to UBCPG and it isn’t cool when UBCPG students omit the extremely important “PG” at times when it benefits them.
It bothers me SO MUCH when people state they go to UBCO when really the conversation goes somewhat like “oh, cool! In Kelowna?” “No no no, I go to the Point Grey Campus.” Bruh, UBCO IS UBC. UBCPG IS UBCPG. I don’t care what the words on your diploma say, UBCPG IS NOT UBC.
In engineering for example, UBCO students APPLY TO A PROGRAM. We BUST OUR ASSES IN FIRST YEAR to get into the program we WANT to study. Whereas in engineering at UBCPG, students basically DON’T EVEN PICK their program.
There are seat caps on any of the programs - YOU COULD HAVE A 51% AVERAGE AND GET INTO MECH.
Long story short:
Dear UBCPG Students,
when someone asks you wear you go to school- say UBCPG. On your resume, say UBCPG. We all know you don’t go to UBCO, so don’t state that you go to UBCO.
And while we’re at it: don’t give me bullshit about it being the same school but a different campus. Congratulations! You go to the POINT GREY CAMPUS VERSION of UBC. THAT IS NOT UBC.
Sincerely,
UBC students who know that it shouldn’t be our responsibility to specify “UBC - Okanagan.” Thank you for coming to my TedTalk","#11072

I never thought too much about those chair stains in the library room. If they were dark someone probably sat on a piece of their peperoni pizza during their all nighter. if they’re the weird white stains, i just assumed they were some sweat stains of a 4 gpa person. So I usually sat on those white stains hoping I will absorb some of that persons intellect.
boy was I right.
to give you some background I've had stomach issues for the past few months. I had some bacteria or some shit that made me lose my appetite making me barely eat. I want to reassure you that I'm okay now, and I eat like a regular person. Three meals a day including breakfast. with that came a normal poop pattern. it was wonderful I poop at least twice a day now.
however my rectum wasn't used to that amount of pooping. I went from once every 3 days to multiple a day. As a result I developed hemorrhoids.
No big deal the doctor said, I'm going to prescribe you with this and you'll be good in a weeks time.
So I went to the pharmacy, and little did I know it was a suppository. I've never used a suppository before, so I didn't imagine it to be bad. It looked cool though, somewhat like those foam earplugs they give out in the library sometimes.
So the next day I took my morning poop put on a latex glove, and in it went. It didn’t feel like anything. I finished my first class, and to the library I went. I sat down at my favorite spot pulled out my laptop and started my studying routine by watching a prank video on youtube. A few mins in I felt a need to fart. No biggie I always do this. I’m quite attractive so no one ever considers me.
But it wasn’t the same, this one was wet and stealthy. I felt something coming out fast. No matter how hard I tried to hold it in, it still escaped. I was in too deep now. Deep in my fucking shit infused suppository liquid.
I didn’t know what to do, it was 3 pm and the library was full. So I decide to sit and wait. Wait till everyone leaves. But they didn’t. I sat there for hours. 1 AM came and it was time, I can’t wait it out anymore. The library closed.
I stood up and looked down at my currently dry excrement. It was dark. I was always right. Sitting on the white stains is a better choice.","#11065

Hi guys! This month marks a year after I have arrived in your beautiful campus for a quick exchange, I know it's pretty self-indulgent at this point, but I'd just like to say this. To all the people who are struggling there, given how bleak winter there tends to be, you will always be deserving of love (be it self-love and/or the love of others) and you will always matter. There's still hope.

TW: Suicide
Last year, a group project member of mine committed suicide. I only found out that she passed away because some students in my faculty were sharing a memorial page under her name. I remember searching all over the internet to find her cause of death, but was unable to find anything related to her name that would indicate foul play. Of course we all know about suicide and mental health, but I never expected it to happen to someone I knew personally. She was hardworking, stubborn and I have to admit we didn’t quite get along but some part of me wishes that I noticed and was able to reach out to her. On the surface, she seemed to be leading a perfect life as a well-off sorority girl, but there’s always more going on than we let others believe. I truly believe that she would have been successful and instigated some kickass change we need in the world with that unforgiving personality of hers. I guess the reason why I’m writing this is to say goodbye. And if anyone out there reading this is going through a tough time, I hope you reach out to seek the help you deserve. I believe in you!","#11052

I do not understand how UBC, an institution that considers itself to be high-ranking among institutions around the world, is so lenient to its staff when it comes to the release of grades.
Our class had one final paper due near the beginning of exams in December (December 12th) and no final exam. This particular course had three sections in total. The other two sections received their grades as normal, however my singular section has still not received grades. How does this happen? I understand that professors deserve a winter break as well, but do students not deserve the respect of having their grades delivered to them promptly or are we low priority?
Some of us have applications due within the next two weeks requiring all grades from the last term. Is this happening to anyone else?
Why is there zero consequences for this lateness?","#11049

Hey OP of confession #11013, I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry that you're going through this. What you're going through, although awful and you shouldn't have to be going through it, are completely normal responses to trauma and seeing people who trigger reminders of that trauma. I also wanted to give you a message of hope, because while I'm not you, I've gone through the exact same thing. I had a group of ""friends"" in my first year of university who would treat me as if I was an awful, horrible monster, and then turn around and withdraw their friendship unless I did/said XYZ thing for them. They made me believe I was absolutely crazy and that the only way to de-crazy myself was to stop being such a bitch and do whatever they said. In the end, the only way I got myself out of their claws was them scapegoating me and kicking me out. They were wrong about who I am, and your ""friends"" were cruel and manipulative to tell you that you were such a horrible person. I've found that emotionally abusive people and groups tend to project their own traits onto the scapegoat- especially if there's a ringleader like your Mary. I've gone through the same kind of anxiety attacks, feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. But I'm better now. I've gone to hours and hours of therapy, made better friends with similar experiences and who can understand that I'm not the monster they made me out to be. I'd advise you to seek out people, whether through clubs, or residence, or other experiences. You don't have to be best friends right away. It's enough to just find one or two people that you're comfortable with. I know it's hard already, and it's going to be hard to let down your guard and to start building trust with new people. But there are so many wonderful people out there, who are worth it, and who can help you if you let them. The people you knew in high school are the kinds of people who are cruel, manipulative, insincere and insecure. Eventually, their life will fall apart because genuinely good people will leave them and they'll only have bitter, hateful people around them. Those were temporary people, people who will never matter. I promise, that if I can be this much happier and healthier after the people that made my life hell left me, that you can too.","#11039

TLDR: if you want the benefits of UBCO, don’t you every have the balls to say “I GO TO UBC.”
In response to 11003:
I grew up in Kelowna and chose to go to UBC, and I must admit that UBCO is a great institution. The class sizes are smaller, there are more opportunities to connect with profs and you’re able to get the benefits of a smaller university. That being said, I have a lot of friends who go to ubco and it isn’t cool when UBCO students omit the extremely important “O” at times when it benefits them.
It bothers me SO MUCH when people state they go to UBC when really the conversation goes somewhat like “oh, cool! In Vancouver?” “No no no, I go to the Okanagan Campus.” Bruh, UBC VANCOUVER IS UBC. UBCO IS UBCO. I don’t care what the words on your diploma say, UBCO IS NOT UBC.
In engineering for example, UBC students APPLY TO A PROGRAM. We BUST OUR ASSES IN FIRST YEAR to get a high GPA so we can get into one of our top choices and still may end up in our third choice. Whereas in engineering at UBCO, students basically JUST PICK which of the three they want. There are no seat caps on any of the programs - YOU COULD HAVE A 51% AVERAGE AND GET INTO MECH.
Long story short:
Dear UBCO Students,
when someone asks you wear you go to school- say UBCO. On your resume, say UBCO. We all know you don’t go to UBC, so don’t state that you go to UBC.
And while we’re at it: don’t give me bullshit about it being the same school but a different campus. Congratulations! You go to the OKANAGAN CAMPUS VERSION of UBC. THAT IS NOT UBC.
Sincerely,
UBC students who know that it shouldn’t be our responsibility to specify “UBC - Vancouver.”","#11036

I read #11008, and I wanted to share my own story. For most of my life, you described how I lived and felt. I always wished that I could be like the person who seemed to be able to chat and be friends with everyone, and I thought maybe I was just born to be shy, that maybe in my next life, I can be born with better social skills.
I started learning about the psychology of introvertedness, and going through every learning resource I can about how to talk to people and make friends. The most liberating moment of my life was when I finally realized that I wasn't shy because of my genetics, I was shy because I wasn't 'well socialized' - I was nervous around strangers because I wasn't well versed in social skills. When my prof compared calculus to fixing a toilet - the first time you ever fix a toilet, you're probably terrified that you'll flood the house, but after 100 times, you'll confidently fix it and put it back without a hitch - and it gave me alot of hope that my social skills was currently at the 'first time fixing a toilet' stage, that if I worked hard enough, I too could be like my childhood classmate I so envied.
Fast forward 2 years later, and I'm happy to meet people and have one on one conversations. Finding friends is still really hard, but I've also accepted that I get along much better with people who are similar to me in personality, and accept the reality that only 1 in 50 people I meet will be this type of person AND have all the logistics be good enough that we could be good friends.
It wasn't easy going out alone to try to make friends. being willing to be uncomfortable is hard. Being willing to accept that sometimes you'll put yourself in an extremely introvert unfriendly environment by accident is terrifying. Finding my own introvert-friendly way of meeting people took alot of nightmares before I knew what types of events to go to and what types to avoid. But as a famous quote one said, we're in our 20's, and our journey is only beginning. All we have now is time, time before we're 80 years old and too late to do anything but look back at our entire life and wonder what else we could have done.","#11029

Trigger warning
I took a gap year hoping that the scars from my high school would take the time the heal and move on — I desperately tried to work things through and keep myself afloat and away from memories of them. I went to a counsellor twice a week at first, then a once a week. I had lots of stuff going on but the explicit revelation that my friends hated me broke the camels back. I tried to disappear.
They explained my sadness as a result of bullying — something I didn’t believe to be true. How could it be? I wasn’t bullied. I was the terrible friend as they all pointed out.
Then, my counsellor pointed out all the frustrations I had and the conflicts — their constant berating of my mistakes and instant characterization of me as the “bad friend” for any misunderstanding and miscommunication to my own understanding of how hard I tried to be everywhere at once with people I pathetically tried to keep as friends even though I knew they despised me already.
I did coffee runs at ass o’clock for more than 6 people sometimes. A last ditch effort. They didn’t ask for it though — I brought it upon myself. I was an idiot that thought being useful could contribute to my own friendship value. But they cared more about the fact that I would talk to other people I see in the hallways when I was supposed to be paying attention to them only even if they were on their phones. Yet, if I spoke to them when they didn’t want me to, I was an attention seeking bitch.
My counsellor relayed that she wasn’t allowed to give me any diagnosis but she gave names for symptoms I described. I would wander the halls experiencing something akin to a drunk blackout — unaware of how I slipped into that blurry space of consciousness and unconsciousness unaware of quite what I’m doing and unable to make sense of anything and what’s real or what’s not. Unable to remember much afterwards either. Mine usually starts and ends with me wondering who I am. If I exist. What my name is. I didn’t know I was dissociating.
My friends didn’t either. But when I had these episodes and wandered the walls I would often be unaware that some of them may be waving their hands or greeting me. Unable to reciprocate, I was rude. Weird. Ruining their mood. Making them uncomfortable. I am their discomfort.
Slowly I was isolated, alienated...I ate my lunches in the washroom like the girls in the cliche movies. My row of seats always ended up with only one chair. I had my best friend who I didn’t want to worry though. She was good to me. She didn’t know what’s going on. Just that the others didn’t like me so much anymore.
But it hurts when they walk towards the two of us from my direction and purposely manoeuvres themselves around me, casting me cold glances and saying distant a “excuse me” so they could come between the two of us to speak her with their backs to us and shove me away then recoil at the brush of our skin as if I was trash.
I can’t help but compare myself with the girl who I had idolized. The first person in the group of people who outcasted me and befriended. Let’s call her Mary. She gave me a group of friends and then spoke so ill of me and explained my mistakes and permanent bad personality traits to cast me away. She was one of my closest friends. She must be right, they thought. Suddenly applying every ill trait to every mistake I made or misunderstanding they refused to understand or clear up and suddenly it was clear: I was indeed the horrible friend. Right?
I tried so hard to keep a single friend when she didn’t try at all. She regularly trash talks every single person in our friend group. She spills secrets the very next day. Mary calls her own best friends “trash ___” without a single ounce or irony or sarcasm. Mary thinks (let’s call her) Sue is a pushover and should just die. Too soft. No backbone. Too easy to manipulate. No personality. A show off. Flaunts her money unfairly so. Stupid nerd. Her thighs are too big. Her diet is fucking hilarious. Mary laughs at other people’s outfits and and sneers at their marks. Yells at us when she’s in a bad mood. Posts Snapchat stories of how much she loves (let’s call her) Anna right after complaining about Anna for the entire class prior. Rolls her eyes each time Anna calls Mary’s name. But smiles when they hug and kiss.
But everyone loves Mary anyway. Because Mary cracks the best jokes. She’s funny. So they can overlook her moods and her bad temper and her fake-ness. Mary is a liar. She broke me and ruined me. She stole my secrets and spilled my guts like worthless tea time gossip while pretending to be my best friend until she wrung me dry and left me out to die.
I’m a whore a slut a worthless piece of shit in every one of their mouths and I believed it and wanted to die so bad. I was the established waste of space and attention whore when they were the ones that kept spinning every incident where they bullied me into submission into an event that I say willingly did for them without pressuring despite the pressure I truly felt — then victimized themselves as unwilling participants in my “pathetic acts of weirdness” and they’re the truly “harmed ones” by having to coexist with me in a single space and endure my toxicity.
Now at UBC I still see some of these people. And I still want to die. I get anxiety attacks each time i cross path with one of them. And Petunia has the audacity and smile and call my name waving at me like we’re still good friends when she wiped her ass and left me in the dust the moment I started getting outcasted.
I don’t know how to make friends anymore I’m scared. I can’t even hold a proper conversation looking someone in the eye. I scratch at my wrists with pens and scissors during panic attacks at the back of lecture halls when I accidentally catch a bad look that most probably wasn’t even directed at me but reminded me so much of Mary.
I am haunted by the silent echoes of Chan centre when I walked across the stage and not a single person clapped for my graduation — reminded of their joyous shouts and hoots and whistles for each other’s turn. I even paid for one of their tickets to the grad. I’m truly an idiot aren’t I. My entire youth — wasted. I am reminded each day I pass by the building.","#11013

Trigger Warning: suicide
I’m in my mid twenties, and I’ve never been closer to suicide until now. This is going to be long and probably depressing, so if you’re interested in reading my life story summed up concisely, get ready.
I recently graduated, but the happiness of being done with undergrad was short lived. I feel numb everyday. I go to my full-time job that pays decently compared to most jobs anyone could get, I work silently because I don't fit in with my outgoing and highly sociable coworkers, go straight home because I have never had any friends and never have any plans to do anything, I binge watch a tv show or some movies or play some video games, I go to sleep, and then rinse and repeat.
Lately, I’ll be watching tv for a while each evening and then suddenly catch myself wondering how easily and effective it might be to walk into the kitchen, pickup a knife and slit my throat. Or alternatively, I started looking up how one would go about hanging themselves with some rope from a ceiling fan. To be quite honest, if suicide were as easy as swallowing a pill that would cause death swiftly and painlessly, I’d probably already be dead.
I know that others likely have it worse off than me in terms of life circumstances, however, my life has never been very good in opinion. I guess it starts back in high school. I went to a school in the lower mainland that was pretty small - to put it into perspective, I believe my graduating class was no more than 120 people. Some might think that this is a good thing - probably friends with everyone you grew up with from grade 8 through 12, right? Wrong. At least, that wasn’t the case for me. I tried, really. But I never really became friends with anyone. I was just kind of along for the ride, hanging out in a hallway with some groups that probably just tolerated me being there. Fast forward to grade 12, still in the same boat, though I felt like I was becoming closer to a few select people. But grade 12 rushed by fast, and after graduating, I went straight into UBC - only knew three other people from my graduating class to come there with me. I was commuting 2 hours one way each day, lost touch with everyone from high school in the chaos of first year UBC. Didn’t make any friends at UBC because at this point, my social anxiety was high and social skills low. Two years into UBC, after final exams, I broke down mentally one night around 11pm infront of my mom. I dropped out basically the next day and decided that I needed to change to a program I wouldn’t be miserable in. About 6 months later, I started in another program at a different school. 3 and a half years later and here we are now - graduated, full time job that could develop into a long term career if I choose to do so, and I’ll be entering into a professional graduate program in about 4 months.
But still, I am sure that you can see what’s missing. Friends, happiness, love. I don’t know when the last time I was even hugged by someone. I’m tearing up just writing these last two sentences. I’m in my mid twenties, with no friends, and now having realizations that I’m never going to fall in love with anyone and have a family of my own. I’m very likely going to hit 30 and be a virgin unless I end up visiting one of these escort services in BC (I recently stumbled upon them online and have been nervously flipping through them). And if I do find a woman interested in me for who I am, how am I going to explain that I have no friends to ever hangout with? That my idea of fun for the past 7 years has been watching tv/movies and playing video games? That’s going to turn out well, right? What happens if, by some miracle, this hypothetical life partner decides she would like to marry me, and we get to planning a wedding and inviting guests, only again for everyone involved to realize that I don't have any friends to invite?
I feel helpless. Years ago, I didn’t think I’d be here, but I am. I can’t help but feel that I just wasn’t meant for life in this world. People just don’t like me because I’m not interesting. I think my ability to socialize was stunted from being shutout and slightly ostracized in highschool. I don’t know. I don't like hiking or travelling much, or any other exciting, fast paced or cultured thing that people are interested in. I like being at home and doing things at home for fun. I don't know how to go out and meet people to be friends with.
I could hardly call what I’m doing right now as “living”, so now I find myself thinking why exist and breathe at all? What kind of life is this? Am I destined to just work myself to death, alone? I'm just merely existing, and I'm tired of it. I've followed UBC Confessions for years now, and every so often I see posts somewhat similar to mine - suicidal, depressed, etc. And I see people responding to those posts with mere words of encouragement about how ""things will get better"". But how is any of this supposed to get better for me? I have literally gone through my prime youth years without a best friend or just a friend.
I wish I was a more likeable, interesting person. I’m afraid that it’s too late for that aspect of myself now. You want to know what’s laughable, though? I’m going to start working out to improve my body appearance, now that I have some free time since I’m not in school. Why? Because looking somewhat physically fit is likely the only way I’m ever going to attract the eye of a woman. Haha, I know. That’s so pathetic. But I’m just deathly afraid of being alone forever now.
I’m sorry for the long-winded, possibly random ordered rant that is probably all over the place. I just want the pain to stop and I have literally no one I can turn to and confide in - I never have. One of the only things stopping me from offing myself right now is that I don’t want to cause that kind of pain and horror to my mom of her walking in to my room to see me laying down with blood pooling from my arms or my body hanging from the ceiling.
It's likely too late for my life to turn around. But for others, it's probably not. So I want to take this time and forum to say something important that is not said enough or very clearly much at all even in an age as progressive as this one: Please, be kinder to those with social anxiety and clear social ineptness. And try to be more tolerable of differences, accepting, and inclusive. I beg of you. I look back on my high school days and wonder how I would have turned out if I wasn't shunned from the start.
That’s all. If I don’t post a follow-up confession after this, I’m gone. Thanks for reading.","#11008
Trigger Warning: suicide
I’m in my mid twenties, and I’ve never been closer to suicide until now. This is going to be long and probably depressing, so if you’re interested in reading my life story summed up concisely, get ready.
I recently graduated, but the happiness of being done with undergrad was short lived. I feel numb everyday. I go to my full-time job that pays decently compared to most jobs anyone could get, I work silently because I don't fit in with my outgoing and highly sociable coworkers, go straight home because I have never had any friends and never have any plans to do anything, I binge watch a tv show or some movies or play some video games, I go to sleep, and then rinse and repeat.
Lately, I’ll be watching tv for a while each evening and then suddenly catch myself wondering how easily and effective it might be to walk into the kitchen, pickup a knife and slit my throat. Or alternatively, I started looking up how one would go about hanging themselves with some rope from a ceiling fan. To be quite honest, if suicide were as easy as swallowing a pill that would cause death swiftly and painlessly, I’d probably already be dead.
I know that others likely have it worse off than me in terms of life circumstances, however, my life has never been very good in opinion. I guess it starts back in high school. I went to a school in the lower mainland that was pretty small - to put it into perspective, I believe my graduating class was no more than 120 people. Some might think that this is a good thing - probably friends with everyone you grew up with from grade 8 through 12, right? Wrong. At least, that wasn’t the case for me. I tried, really.

I honestly can't understand why UBCO is allowed to be affiliated with UBC? Or at least why it is seen as a university of similar standard? It has sub-par admission requirements and its clear that students that attend UBCO just couldn't get in to UBC. If you can't get in, don't try and use the clout from university you couldn't even get into. I think it's embarassing that UBC tries to make more money by creating a second campus of much poorer quality and education standards. I worked hard to get here and don't want my schools reputation tainted by the lesser academic statues of the Okanagan campus.
Sincerely,
Upset","#11003

As an UBC graduate and alumni, one of the biggest regrets that I have is having neglected to develop the social & romantic aspects of my life while I was a student. Dating and forging friendships are tremendously more difficult while out of school/working compared to being on campus, where you are surrounded by like-minded peers who share the same struggles and aspirations as you.
Granted, there certainly are upsides to bootstrapping your romance department post-school, such as less academic/parental pressure and greater emotional maturity among those in the dating pool, but I cannot help but feel that starting this late in life (I'm ~24 by the way) has been far more of a rocky climb than I had anticipated.
My advice for younger folks who are in university is, while focusing on academics and professional development are undoubtedly the most crucial part of your life at this stage, please don't forget to nurture your social and/or love life; treat the latter the same way you would your academics (although not necessarily to the same extent). After all, the ultimate goal of having a post-secondary education is to have better things in life, and I cannot stress the importance of friendship & intimacy in this pursuit.","#11002

I'm grateful for the opportunities it's unlocked, and don't anticipate that to change, but I didn't expect to feel as socially isolated even though I was now part of a smaller group that shares classes and goals. The others don't seem to have the same problem, but I found it easy to get tired of the echo chamber of conversations about academics. I think the program selects for people who are more neurotic than typical, so talking with them only gives me anxiety. I went to the Nest to have lunch alone for once, and it was nice sitting with strangers also minding their own business in one of those lounge areas,.

I’ve realized that I’ve definitely screwed up any chance of getting into my preferred program in engineering.
I failed a class last semester, which tanked my gpa. Looking at historical averages for each program, I’m below average for every single program listed.
On top of that, I didn’t join a design team in first semester because I had a heavy course load that semester. I thought I could join one in second semester when I had less classes. I’ve applied to a lot of them, and I haven’t been accepted into a single one, probably because they filled up all the positions in first semester.
With the grades I have, there’s no way I’m gonna get into the engineering program I want. In fact, I don’t think I’ll make it into any program I have the slightest interest in. I’m honestly thinking of redoing first year at this point, if that’s even possible.

After essay submission, I was blackmailed to send in more money or they will inform UBC. I ended up paying $1000 more but they keep wanting more. I closed my laptop, and went to sit down with my professor to confess. I ended up having to rewrite the essays at the prof's mercy.

But.............
He is my boyfriends older brother.
We met at his mothers 50th birthday party and I never expected to feel this way. My boyfriend (BF) and I have been dating for 4 years and everyone thinks we are destined to marry. My BF is one year younger than me and is the wacky sporty one in his family. His older brother is my age and is the studious brother. He is insanely good-looking.
I know that I can never ever be with the love of my life. Although I would never want to hurt my BF (his brother) and would sacrifice everything to make sure he doesn't find out. I just have to be with the love of my life. But I know he would never do that to his brother. I can tell he loves me too. We always find excuses to be together even if it can only be platonic. He has told me cryptically his desire to be with me. I plucked up the courage to ask him what he would do if he fell in love with his brothers girlfriend. He told me even though he would feel like crying to sleep every night because he wanted to be with her he just couldn't do it.","#10939

And the sad thing is. I hate myself for saying this. But I truly wished she had just died.

As a CBC, I feel it my obligation to educate the newcomers from the PRC of the Chinese plight beyond their country.
Many of you have grown up believing in the superiority of the West, only now to be disappointed by what you find to be aging and lacking infrastructure, and debilitating democractic governing institutions which hamper economic progress. Some of you can't even wait to leave, so superior is your home to what you have found here. The nationalists of your bunch are quick to point out the hypocrisies of the West too, should China come under criticism - and indeed, the West does have many flaws, but since when did two wrongs make a right?
Here in Canada, we have freedom to speak our minds on society and politics, we can opine openly to friends, neighbors and strangers without fear of reprisals from the government, and we have a society that operates on the principle of the rule of law.
These ideals were what allowed the overseas Chinese community, particularly in Vancouver, to support the numerous insurrections against the Qing, and continue to be why so many Chinese have fled the country and region to come here. We have a special place in the history of modern Chinese history, and as globalization and Chinese emigration continues, that may become even more the case. The original embassy of the Republic of China still stands in Chinatown, and what it represents lives on today. China is not the CCP, nor is the CCP necessary for its success. One might even say that the RoC would've done what the CCP did decades earlier, minus the largest human manslaughter in history. China has been great before the CCP and it will be great without it too - and hold much friendlier relations with the various countries of the world.
You have come to university hopefully to educate yourselves and leave an impact on this world by the time you pass. Scholars have always been the impetus for drastic change, and we should carry that legacy with pride. Learning also meaning being wrong sometimes, or at least being open to hearing other viewpoints. To that end, I would encourage you to step out of your comfort zone, and meet people you don't usually associate with. Exchange with them, seeing things from their boots and they your's.
I have heard from you cautious hopefulness, and rueful defeat, roaring indignance and placid ambivalence. But if there is one thing I want you to remember, that is to think critically, for yourself and never give up hope.
Lastly, I am grateful to Canada for giving us refuge here in times of turmoil and letting us a chance to prosper. Perhaps a democractic China can one day give back in turn to the countries who have sheltered so many of its people.","#10910
As a CBC, I feel it my obligation to educate the newcomers from the PRC of the Chinese plight beyond their country.
Many of you have grown up believing in the superiority of the West, only now to be disappointed by what you find to be aging and lacking infrastructure, and debilitating democractic governing institutions which hamper economic progress. Some of you can't even wait to leave, so superior is your home to what you have found here. The nationalists of your bunch are quick to point out the hypocrisies of the West too, should China come under criticism - and indeed, the West does have many flaws, but since when did two wrongs make a right?
Here in Canada, we have freedom to speak our minds on society and politics, we can opine openly to friends, neighbors and strangers without fear of reprisals from the government, and we have a society that operates on the principle of the rule of law.
These ideals were what allowed the overseas Chinese community, particularly in Vancouver, to support the numerous insurrections against the Qing, and continue to be why so many Chinese have fled the country and region to come here. We have a special place in the history of modern Chinese history, and as globalization and Chinese emigration continues, that may become even more the case.

I've been in Sauder now for just over 3 years, and not once have I thought to myself, ""Wow, I'm glad I spent over 30k on this experience!"" In fact, I more often than not think, ""Wow, I wish I had just googled this and saved myself the hassle."" If it wasn't for Sauder's Alumni/student network, going to school would be completely useless. I've failed a total of 3 courses, have an average of about 62, yet I end up getting every single job I apply for. Why? Cuz I decided early on to sacrifice grades for work experience. Employers don't give a fuck that you got 99% in second year finance if your conversations are blander than a slice of fuckin white bread during the interview. I laugh every time I see people freaking out about their average, getting all worked up thinking that ""co-op will never accept me, thus (*insert big 4 firm here) won't accept me, blah blah blah."" Relax. Get the fuck outta Sauder for once, and stop thinking that grades are your ""end all be all."" A dude with straight C's will get the same shitty Sauder degree as you and your straight A's. The only difference being that the person with C's is probably more personable, has more work experience, and will thus get the job over you anyways.","#10906

I finally manage to find professor Robert Raussendorf so that I may discuss my project with him. He is just finishing up with one of his upper year students. I was not caught up in the minutia the discussion because my gaze was instead fixed on Robert as if bound by a divine creature. Fixed, I watched in awe while Robert described the complexities of quantum entanglement as if it were nothing to him. It truly was nothing to him. His rigid arms dance while he demonstrates his breathtaking intellectual capacity in a few words. I admire his delicate, yet firm physique. He glances at me with his sharp eyes, and my body immediately freezes, trapped by the gaze of his glittering eyes. I’ve never felt like this. He makes me feel so small, but I don’t want him to know. He has finished his conversation and acknowledges my presence, asking if I would like to speak to him. I ask him about the quantum computing.
Proceeding his answer, he asks “ya?” in a short, cool breath. I do not understand, but I do not want to disappoint Robert. I reply a quick and confident “ya” in an enlightened tone. With a short glance he analyzes me to determine whether I had actually understood. I am so nervous as I wait his response; I seek his validation. His eyes fill with approval and he begins speaking. I am overcome with joy. I blissfully nod my head and open myself to Robert so that he can fill me with knowledge. I did not notice that everyone has left, but we are now alone. I’d imagine a situation like this, right before I’d fall asleep. He empties his knowledge on me but I do not understand. I begin to cry. With a quick motion he tucks my hair behind my ear and shusses me. I look up at him as he strokes my cheek with a delicate rhythm. The project didn’t matter anymore, the thought of it vanished as fast as the smile on Robert’s smooth face, when he realized my frustration. Our eyes lock, and his eyes pierce mine. I begin to understand. I am overcome by his warmth. Moments from my childhood flash before me like the steady clicking of a movie projector. He is there. I feel safe.","#10898

Fable: Adventure of a prototype SUS premed
First year: You apply for SUS first year committee. You write your high school experience as ""key club president"" and ""me-to-we club vice president"" on the application. You hear back from SUS in October that based on their random, invalid adjudication process designed by third and fourth year SUS execs (who all happen to be in Integrated Science) that you got the position. You immediately let it get to your head and start thinking you belong in a highly advanced group of keen students who are all going to get into medical school. You stop talking to Veronica, an old friend of 4 years, who didn't get into FYC.
Second year: After incessantly sucking up to the SUS vice presidents, you gain enough rapport to muster the courage of running for assistant vice president. You of course would never run as vice president in your second year, you need to work up for that. You then listen to the advice of upper years to pick Integrated Science as a major, as they say it's the best major to get into medical school for. You don't question their authority, even though oddly none of them actually got into medical school this year, and most of them are in their fifth year still taking first year electives to boost their GPA. But you aren't like them - you're going to be a success story. During the summer, you write your MCAT.
Third year: After your work as an AVP, you finally muster up the courage to run for a VP position. You make a Facebook page and print out maybe like 6 flyers (printing costs money, man), not because you need it to win, but because you want to make it seem like you actually care. In reality you know that you've buttered up to enough SUS people to win the position by a landslide, since 90% of voters for the SUS elections are SUS executives. You get your MCAT back in October - a solid 72nd percentile - around 20th percentile behind UBC medical school's average. Your grades aren't that great either, despite being in a pre-med GPA boosting major. But it's okay, since you should have great extracurriculars being involved in SUS. You get your medical school application back - you didn't get in. You're flabbergasted at how low your score is, and why the people at the medical school aren't putting much weight to your experience of ""facilitating socials for students of your undergraduate society to promote inclusion and mental health."" You start to worry, as you realize maybe all this time you put into SUS could have been a bit more efficient.
Fourth year: Still no medical school invite. You realize maybe you're too good for medical school, and you should use your vast array of leadership skills into something more lucrative - like maybe computer science or business. You realize that the BCS program is just as academically competitive as medical school, so there's no way you'll get in. And business school requires the GMAT - there is no way you're going to write another standardized exam after the MCAT. You end up applying to a local bank for a teller position. Success - they wanted you to join their team! You start next Monday for $18.22 an hour - a great use of your degree. Meanwhile, you see Veronica's Facebook post - she was accepted into medical school. After you ghosted her, you realize that Veronica worked on some real cool ass shit, and worked hard to develop herself not as a premed, but as a person. You laugh at how dumb she is for choosing to go through 4 more years of school, then block her since you don't need toxicity in your life.","#10881

You laugh at how dumb she is for choosing to go through 4 more years of school, then block her since you don't need toxicity in your life.",,1545861601,,,161,108,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2229000707118210&id=1287650764586547,

I tactfully shuffle my way down to the doctor’s office and when he lubes up I nearly cum every time. But I’ve trained my keggle muscles enough to the point where I can hold in Mount Vesuvius’s wrath. then as soon as he puts the smallest bit of pressure on my prostate I unleash with the fury of a lion hunting it’s prey. As the room gets covered in my hot sticky juices the doctor looks on disgusted and leaves the room. I always go to a hospital far away from where I live to get it so that I don’t have to go in for surgery under the doctor that I busted to. Best thing is we have free healthcare, so the doctor gets me off and it’s covered by taxpayers. That’s my fetish.","❄#10861

I'm sad to say that every Varsity athlete I've met has been explicitly rude and full of themselves. Not trying to stereotype here since I'm always open to meeting new people and am sure there are some athletes who I'd get along great with, but I have been disappointed each time so far.
I know that this community spends a lot of time together with countless hours of training, but why are they making themselves unavailable for new friendship? I have been walking with someone I know on the Field Hockey team when he's run into fellow athletes and they've had FULL ON conversations in front of me, without even acknowledging my presence let alone saying hi. It was so awkward. I stood there and stared at my feet for a solid five minutes. I have never experienced such explicit rudeness in the rest of my years here at UBC. The boys I've met through Tinder are no better, many full of self-obsessing comments and unable to hold any sort of meaningful conversation.
It really sucks to attend such an amazing university yet have a poor athletics department. Maybe our student turn-out for games isn't so great because no one likes anyone on the team. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","#10830

It was the day after all finals ended and me and my roommate decided to celebrate by smoking weed at night. We were smoking at the Green House outside of Orchard Commons and it was really dark, so I used my phone as flashlight and placed it on the ground. After 3 joints we got really high and I went back to my room and started watching Netflix. 30 minutes later I got paranoid and thought I left my phone at the place we smoked. I grabbed my keys and ran outside, in the rain, with my t-shirt, shorts, and flip flops. I ran to the place and didn't find my phone so I started panicking and literally running around campus banging on every door and glass windows. What everyone sees is at 2 am, a sketchy guy smelling like marijuana running around with flip flops under the rain and screaming. I am surprised no one called campus security on me. After 20 minutes, I sprinted back to my dorm and started shouting to my roommate and crying. He told me to chill the fuck down but I won't listen. Until later when I went back to my room I found my phone under my blanket on the bed. This is what weed do to you. Don't do drug, kids :)","#10824

Hi, I just wanna say I'm sick and tired of hearing all this negative press about China. I was born in California so I grew up always hearing negative shit about China to the point where I was ready to denounce my own ethnicity cuz I always thought China was so shitty. But the more I learned and the more I traveled in China, it's not that bad?? I have family who are Uyghur living in XinJiang and they practice Islam. When I went to visit, their life is so good and well sustained with help from the government? They aren't being forced to denounce their religion or eat pork and neither are their friends and family who practice Islam. Obviously I haven't been all over and that may not be the case for other areas which makes me ignorant but honestly sometimes the press from Western media makes my blood boil like the detainment camps and the stuff about the social rating stuff in black mirror becoming a reality. If you ask any international kid from China or their friends back in China, none of them have ever heard of this system or is really aware. I can't believe made in China is still a joke cuz 30-40 years ago Made in Japan was considered shit and now look at things branded as ""Made in Japan"". I totally get why there is negative connotation around China and it's government and I agree but at the same time, China is still a developing country as well as a lot of other middle eastern countries. I don't see anyone yelling about human rights when the British used kids as workers in the Industrial revolution when they were developing. I know times have changed but at the same time I don't think it's fair for all this judgement from western countries who have already had the chance to develop to point a finger ad say no that's wrong. I still love being an American, I just wish people would be a bit more understanding and not believe western media immediately and go after communism and bring up other shit that's really not helping to solve the problem. I've already gotten a lot of weird looks and a lot of people have said I've been ""brainwashed"" but I'm just telling my perspective and someone who is Chinese but was born in America and finally had the chance to travel to China

TL;DR China really isn't that bad and for people who make you feel bad about your ethnicity (this includes anyone), fuck them","#10761

The faculty of engineering has some major problems and after being in this program for two years now I'm absolutely sick of this shit. first off, the standardized time tables. If you drop a course your schedule is fucked for the rest of time. For students with chronic illness or mental health problems, or learning disabilities, taking 7 classes a semester is not possible. Its not. not to mention the fucked up egotistical approach most engineers seem to have towards this aspect of our degree. you get treated not only by peers but by TA's and professors and academic advisers as if not being able to handle that level of coursework makes you lesser or an idiot, its absolutely infuriating. you also have no say whatsoever in when your classes are, who your profs are, or what classes you can take. I have been so utterly fucked over by bad profs its not even funny. Now, of course to an extent I understand that its my responsibility to learn the material, and trust me, I do my best. but on the other hand I'm paying literally thousands of dollars to study at this institution and I expect my profs to at least be somewhat competent. I personally feel that this kind of stress is so unnecessary and its part of a bigger fundamental problem within engineering; mental health. its the elephant in the room and from an institutional aspect its almost completely ignored. As someone with severe anxiety and a learning disability I have had to fight tooth and nail to make this degree work for me and honestly, I'm pretty disappointed in UBC. access and diversity is almost completely useless, academic advising has no idea what they're talking about, and even the administration board was almost no help. I almost flunked out first year because my mental health got to a point where I realistically was not able to perform academically. this year, after battling my way through institutional bullshit I'm now near the top of my classes but getting to that point should not have been that difficult. I'm seriously disheartened that the faculty is this intent on ignoring such a major problem. In the past couple of years there has been a lot of 'soft' progress made by students on handling the workload like advocating for meditation, eating healthier, and exercising, etc which is still good and its a step in the right direction, but its not the kind of solutions that most students with serious health problems need.","#10756

This post may upset half of human race, I apologize in advance. I don't know how else to address this problem. I'm a 21-year-old white Christian male born in Hamilton but sometimes I feel like an outlier in my department. Last year was a huge lesson for me when I volunteered at one of the psychology labs, I quickly saw that I was only one of the few white males there.
I was disappointed at the large number of females I saw working for a psychology lab. All those famous psychologists (Freud, Skinner, Pavlov, Piaget, etc) are males. How come so many females are in psychology now. Not to upset anyone here but I felt like I was working with the wrong gender. I am not sure why Canadian university accept so many women, and secondly, I am not sure why I’m not considered a minority in my field. Experiences such as these and living in UBC makes me think about sexism a lot. I would never vote for somebody like Trump but at the same time, I'd like to preserve my the male dominated culture that has lasted for so long. Not in a violent way like some groups do, but in a way that is understanding for everyone. How can I raise issues like these in a way that is not sexist?","#10713

Sometimes, when I get stressed, I forget to shower or just plain old can’t be bothered. But now, I’ve made it a rule that every time I poop I have to take a shower. This means I’m showering a solid 1-2 times a day which is great for my stress levels, hygiene, self-esteem, and sex life. My boyfriend loves it. Also means that I feel fresh and clean after each poop which is a definite bonus.
Has anyone else tried this? I would highly recommend.

Growing up upper middle class, I always had this notion of homeless people as rude, dirty and harmful at worst and a burden at best, but today I had an experience that changed that. I'll try to keep it short, but this morning I was walking through the university village when a scruffy looking guy approached and asked for a favor. I was hesitant at first, but he said he hadn't eaten in a while, and asked if I could get something for him, insisting that he didn't want money or anything, just food. Feeling bad, I got him breakfast at McDonald's. He was extremely grateful, and proceeded to share some of his past with me.
In short, he was abused growing up and committed some small crimes later in life to get by but was caught, leading him to where he is now. He shared that he had a lot more to say, and wanted to speak to someone in developmental psychology to share his childhood experiences with. I felt bad because I don't really know anyone I could have referred him to, but I sincerely hope he's able to find someone to get his story out there. And to others like me that used to see the homeless near campus as a nuisance and threat, maybe consider that they aren't just drug users or mentally ill, but that some are simply just victims of unfortunate circumstances.","#10677

(Apologize for the jumping from one train of thought to the next but meh it's my confession)
I tried so hard not to let a depressive mood overcome me during the run up to finals but I guess my brain had other ideas. I feel numb, or maybe numb isn't the right word (can you still be numb whilst being sad?), I feel tired not just physically but with everything in my life. My love-life is not great, my grades are ok but don't think it's sufficient for grad school, my family is relatively cold with my parents becoming more conservative as they grow older. In retrospect I feel like I haven't been the greatest sibling to my brothers and sisters. The one good thing in my life are my friends, but lately even when I'm hanging with them it feels like I'm standing on the periphery looking in. I kind of just do my own thing these days.
I also don't like burdening people with my problems which is why I message myself my critical and anxious thoughts.
I also feel bad for feeling this way because I know my life is relatively easy, I have my health, my family, I'm privileged to study in a country that allows you to say what you want (compared to other countries I've lived in). I know all these things and I should be thankful and happy instead of wallowing in self pity. Maybe I've become comfortable in this state, I don't know and frankly I kind of don't care at this point in time.
I am really scared for what comes post-grad not career wise but my mental state, I don't feel like I'll last that long by myself especially if I move to somewhere new. Maybe I will but hey look on the bright side I'm in the process of finishing a goodbye letter just in case that happens to apologize (customary where I'm from to apologize before long departures) in advance if it does come to that.
Not looking for advice but wanted to share what I was going through anonymously so that my friends don't look at me with pity or sadness in their eyes.

It's kind of two topics but sort of all on the same major topic, which is fertility.
I don't care and don't understand why people make a big deal about infertility. Yeah, it sucks not getting what you want, but I don't have a ferrari, you don't see me making headlines. Yet society acts like it's a big deal. Which kind of leads me to the second point. For some reason, being child free makes me selfish, which sure, I guess it is. But how is it anyworse than having a kid? Everyone has a kid for themselves. (Some pretend and say it's for god, but that's debateable) And I think people who cannot be a parent emotionally, resource wise etc are just as selfish.
Anyways, can we stop pressuring people to pop out babies? We're overpopulated as it is. The world is creating so much garbage, killing so many species.","#10650

Is it just me or is ""Fluent in English"" becoming a common requirement for a lot of jobs here in Canada? Frankly (not to sound entitled, whiny, or prejudiced), I believe it's unfair that this is becoming a norm, especially in today's politically correct atmosphere. English is not an indigenous language of Canada, so the fact that employers are listing it as a REQUIREMENT for a position is plain discrimination. If instead it was noted that applicants that speak English are preferred then I would have no issue whatsoever. And I understand that being Anglocentric is a useful skill but I don't believe that it should be a determining factor for a job where speaking a non-indegenous language is not a necessity but rather a preference. Just my 2 cents.","#10645

I'm not sure why Canadian companies hire so many minorities, and secondly, I'm not sure why I'm not considered a minority anymore.

HOLY SHIT man some of these communications courses for science/engineering are so fucking dumb. Don’t get me wrong, I get that being able to express your ideas fluently is important, but these classes aren’t helping me do that. The material is mostly common sense, but they have to assign these cryptic vocabs that just over-complicates everything. Hey assholes, how about you make your own communication more understandable before you design a course on communications?
I bet the fuckers that made these courses are communication major losers who literally got the second biggest meme degree behind gender studies and realized they are worth fuck all to society, so now they are overcompensating for their crippling ineptitude by insulting the intelligence of students in more relevant disciplines with textbooks full of unintelligible jargonese marinated in industrial grade snake oil. I’m surprised the compsci nerds aren’t researching a new field of cryptography from these communications textbooks because even a fucking quantum computer won’t be able to crack this shit.
And some of the course materials violate the very principle it seeks to teach. Seven Cs, really? The list of Cs is not concise, because there are literally four words that overlap in meaning. It’s not clear, because you always miss one of the Cs when they want you to list it off in exams since you can’t differentiate them from each other. It’s not concrete, because it’s a bunch of jargonese hocus pocus. It’s not considerate because they expect you to memorize these bullshit, and it’s not courteous because this whole thing is fucking rude.
And the instructors don’t make these class better. Often times they are teaching a bunch of science/engineer kids but have ZERO background in these subjects whatsoever. If it was a general English course then fine, but these classes are supposed to teach us communications specific to our fucking field aren’t they? So why are a bunch of people scared by an integral sign teaching them to us? And they assign so much homework too, as if they expect this to be our only class. Excuse me what the fuck?

HOLY SHIT man some of these communications courses for science/engineering are so fucking dumb. Don’t get me wrong, I get that being able to express your ideas fluently is important, but these classes aren’t helping me do that. The material is mostly common sense, but they have to assign these cryptic vocabs that just over-complicates everything. Hey assholes, how about you make your own communication more understandable before you design a course on communications?
I bet the fuckers that made these courses are communication major losers who literally got the second biggest meme degree behind gender studies and realized they are worth fuck all to society, so now they are overcompensating for their crippling ineptitude by insulting the intelligence of students in more relevant disciplines with textbooks full of unintelligible jargonese marinated in industrial grade snake oil. I’m surprised the compsci nerds aren’t researching a new field of cryptography from these communications textbooks because even a fucking quantum computer won’t be able to crack this shit.
And some of the course materials violate the very principle it seeks to teach. Seven Cs, really? The list of Cs is not concise, because there are literally four words that overlap in meaning. It’s not clear, because you always miss one of the Cs when they want you to list it off in exams since you can’t differentiate them from each other. It’s not concrete, because it’s a bunch of jargonese hocus pocus. It’s not considerate because they expect you to memorize these bullshit, and it’s not courteous because this whole thing is fucking rude.
And the instructors don’t make these class better. Often times they are teaching a bunch of science/engineer kids but have ZERO background in these subjects whatsoever. If it was a general English course then fine, but these classes are supposed to teach us communications specific to our fucking field aren’t they? So why are a bunch of people scared by an integral sign teaching them to us? And they assign so much homework too, as if they expect this to be our only class. Excuse me what the fuck?

Topic: OCD
People throw around that word as if it's something fashionable to have. As a person clinically diagnosed with the condition, nothing pisses me off more than when someone says """"I'm so OCD about cleaning my room"""" or some vague shit about having OCD just because you like having things organised. OCD is not even remotely what these people make it out to be. It's a raging monster inside the head that tells you all kinds of negative stuff that you know is irrational but you still can't ignore it. It's a constant battle with your mind 24x7. Compulsions are not a choice but hopeless attempts to minimize that anxiety your brain is feeding you. Heck, I didn't even have physical compulsions and yet I was diagnosed with OCD.
For all of you out there having obsessive thoughts about anything, hang in there and get help. I just presumed I was going insane because of my obsession with something extremely trivial. Fortunately with the help of a professional, I am actively trying to overcome it. If you think you have irrational anxiety, please get help. OCD is very treatable.
And please think twice before casually throwing around words like OCD and depression. It desensitizes mental illness for those who are legitimately suffering from it.","#10606

Recently I often sext on the weekends with a man in his 40s in Ontario. I met him on a chat forum one day as I was so depressed about getting over my failed first love. This stranger is polite and kind to me, and I received kind advice from him on how to move on. He's also having a rough marriage so I also cheer him up with words of encouragement and support in civilized conversations when we don""t sext. Apparently both sexting and respectful, confidential conversations between us are a major boost to his self-esteem. But I don't actually feel turned on by talking dirty to him, I would try imagining the man as my ex when sexting but I just can't. I still miss my first love and have a lot of feelings for him, and I can't feel turned on with anyone else but him, either in real life or virtually. Therefore, I don't see the point of chatting and sexting back and forth anymore aside from making a stranger happier and occasionally getting good relationship advice, and it is starting to eat up my time that I could've spent studying. Plus I can't help feeling that sexting with him is rather immoral as he's a legit married man with a 4-year-old daughter. No one knows about me sexting this man, but I'd be so embarrassed if my friends or anyone knew about this. It's so unethical right? Should I cut ties to this man completely, or just stop sexting him but continuing with non-sexual conversations? He's genuinely a very nice man so I don't want to hurt his feelings but I don't find a need to continue sexting as I still genuinely have feelings with my ex. Any advice would be appreciated.","#10574

A few days ago, I went to an Afghan restaurant, and we were a group of 10. I was very surprised to see that they included 20 % tip for everyone in the bill and quite frankly, was very mad that they didnt let tips be optional as the service was quite terrible.

As much as I appreciate UBC creating THRIVE week this year and bringing more awareness to mental health, if they think it's going to make students be okay with not having a Term 1 reading week they are dead wrong. Having a few events - that I can’t even attend because of all the work I have - with free ice cream and handing out “happy” yellow umbrellas does nothing at all to alleviate all the stress and work piling up on me right now. I have to choose between sleeping enough to be able to produce good work and understand it, or attending all my classes and doing all my work for clubs and classes on time. I know people in the comments will just say “work on your time management” but as someone who struggles with mental health, it’s a process and I’m struggling to get my grades up without having anxiety attacks. I am literally stressed out about all aspects of my life at the moment, and a week or even a few days to sleep, catch up on work and start studying for round two of midterms would be a saving grace at this point in the semester.
So UBC - why not have a fall reading week? Your bullshit excuses about scheduling and teaching days won’t work for long, many other top-tier Canadian Universities have a reading week this Term and they haven’t broken down. Their exams end before ours, and they start at the same time we do. You have an obligation to the mental health and wellbeing of your 50,000+ students. Its complete crap that the AMS and students have been pushing for this for four or more years and we haven’t seen any movement at all. Pick it up.","#10543

There's so many confessions complaining about students walking across roads without looking. It's almost like no one realizes that we really think that being hit is better than being in school. To the students who feel the same, hang in there!! I just graduated and visited UBC last week, and it was the first time in 4 years I wanted to look both ways before crossing the road. Without school, it really does get better.
You got this.
I believe in you.","#10539

I live about 1.5 hours away from campus and decided to move into a relative's place to make the transit easier. I kept telling myself that I'd get a flu shot because everyone on campus is sick, but kept procrastinating... and lo and behold, flu symptoms started showing up last week. I told my mom I got sick, and she not only brought me chicken soup and lots of comfort food, but she also brought me stuff from home and temporarily started driving me to school from my cousin's house just to make it easier on me.
As a first year student used to getting high 90s, I was crushed after getting my first few midterms back and burnt out from the change in lifestyle. Since most of my friends aren't in UBC, I always feel isolated at here. As a result of these factors, I kind of took out my frustration and dissatisfaction on the people around me - namely, my mom. I complain on a regular basis already, and it got worse when I entered university.
However, after I got sick, I've come to realize that I haven't been appreciating the things I do have. I was always dissatisfied with how embarrassing my mom is, or irritated with how bad her English was. She always puts me first, but it was only after I got sick that I realized I never really appreciated her enough. That being said, she's always had serious respiratory and coronary issues, so I fear that the time I have with her might be far more limited than I would like to think.
Anyway, for the people with supportive parents, just make sure you let them know that you appreciate them. (A lot of the confessions on this page have been so stressful or depressing lately, so I just wanted to share something that made me feel really appreciated and supported.)","#10532

So recently, I've been seeing an increasing amount of tirades from arts students about how both engineering and science students should not act like hot shots, degrading engineering to a mere """"applied science."""" (Note: we don't want them either!) Don't get me wrong. I'm a pure maths/physics/computer science student, and I hate the lot of engineers as any of y'all lot cause I do truly think that they complain about their work load and difficulty when: (a) difficulty wise, their problems are no where near as difficult as any physics or math problems, and (b) their attitudes are one of superiority, participating in cult like drinking activities, or having an exclusive circle of people that only other engineers can partake in--effectively the lot of them try to act cool when most of them belong on 4chan /r9k or their mothers' basements. (Looking at you, software engineers.) Engineers are always going to be those who work for others, and not those who can manage because low IQ, math deficient and immoral businessmen are those who run the world. (Note: businessmen and actuarial scientists can't do math. It's a proven fact. Throw at them any calculus question more advanced than high school and they'll melt into a pool of liquid.) But, despite these differences, I shall cast aside those conflicts and explain why arts students have the least amount of qualifications to scream at any of us. After that, I'll explain why business students have even lesser qualification to do so. And also, for the express purpose of this argument biology will be counted as a real science.
Pure Arts students:
See, the thing with you liberal arts students is that most of y'all hole yourselves up into this seclusive, idealistic world of emotions and whatnot where feelings pervades fact. Not that I mind or anything, since I guess the process of art has always been like Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, where the lone artist comes forth with a revelation high upon his ivory tower to spread messages and ideas to the masses. However, here's where my problem with you current """"pure"""" arts students arises from. Since the inception of the postmodern movement, the original meaning that we once derived from art (which is the spreading of messages, ideas, little acts of rebellions, appeasements, glorification, honor, the pensiveness of human nature) from the Baroque movement forward has been replaced with this modern icky abstractness where three lines painted on a white canvas can go for a few million dollars, where once lofty paintings of Napoleon-- instilling national pride into the people--mathematical experimentation such as with Van Gogh, or the pensiveness of Debussy existed. Like goddamn. All you pure arts students and what you do are literally useless. You provide nothing for society. Now, you don't even spread useful messages for the general masses that provides utility for them in any way shape or form. What meaningful messages can you provide for us that is like """"godly wisdom""""? What do you talk to us about human nature? What pride, what emotions do you instill into us? That is why modern art is no longer admirable, because you don't provide for the people anything. Modern art has become a gratuitous luxury, a mere collector's item, rather than providing anything too meaningful that could revolutionize or change society. You music students study off of the greats of the past, but do not continue their legacy forwards. When Horowitz died was when classical music started dying. We carry forth the legacies of the greats, and we shape our modern day theories in their presence, or revise them to better our understanding. For god sakes even Soviet propaganda artists were more useful than all y'all lot could ever be (though Marxism is still a big no-no.) Meanwhile, us scientists, as well as engineers, have been hard at work the last century. Art didn't win y'all the First or Second World Wars. It was us, and the countless hours and human sacrifices that we have made in order to better your world, and y'alls ivory towers so that you could do your useless shenanigans. Marie Curie died for your asses so that now you could get cancer treatment. Countless faceless masses buried in secrecy tested and built the atomic bombs so that we could stop the atrocities of World War Two. Scientists experimented on themselves in order for you to have better treatment. We spend days and nights toiling and piddling with “mere experimentation” to better society. Even now we do. We found that time travelling is mathematically possible. A 90 year old mathematician (Michael Atiyah, bless his heart) stepped forward to present a proof for a millennium problem, demonstrating to us the undying will of human curiosity and propensity for knowledge. What has any artist done? Even the pens, the keyboards, the aisle, the chisel, the chalk, everything that y’all pure arts fuckers use on a daily basis were made by us. Omae wa mou, shindeiru. Though, I have to admit, the existence of Rule34… *ahem* Bowsette
Liberal arts students:
Engineers get degrees, political science students take coffee orders. (I prefer Grande Cold Brews with an injection of mocha please.) Mathematicians teach, sociologists work at McD’s. Computer scientists work in the Valley, all liberal arts students live w their mothers till their 40. Most y’all aren’t even computer literate. Nuff said.
Business students: (Please note that business degrees are also arts degrees! It’s a faux-pas pseudo-science at best.)
Two things. 1. Businessmen can’t do math. Which means that they’re inherently illogical, and more inclined towards connivery and sly tactics. As a question of morality and ethics, I’d trust scientists and engineers any day because they all have to follow very strict ethical guidelines, and as a result are more likely to be morally astounding citizens. Meanwhile, businessmen are trained to be Machiavellian, to do whatever it takes in order to achieve their own ends. Don’t give me any of the “ethical” or “moral” business bullcrap since business is still a capitalist undertone, so they just do whatever is in their best interest (like a broken record). Which is why freeform capitalism can never exist, and the government needs to be an umpire. 2. We scientists and engineers are the backbone of any corporations. Thue numbers and projections y’all boneheads use? We made ‘em. Your R&D teams? We are them. Without your IT teams, see how long your company can last. We created the systems so y’all could be snakes. Without us, all of you are nothing. So, appease us.","#10531

Sauder kids seriously need to stop walking around like they are the greatest fucking people to ever exist. You might have that lanky ass building that always has a spilled drink in front of it, you are important for creating competition to make things cheaper, but hear me when I say this, YOU ARE JUST KILLING MORE TREES BY PRINTING MORE MONEY. If anyone should be walking around like they own the place it’s the Forestry kids at UBC. They do real work and come up with novel ways to make sustainable wood processing, and conserve forests to make sure they don't die. I hate to say this because I have friends who are Sauder kids... but at the end of the day you people are just taking trees that forestry kids are trying to save and cutting it down. Please don't take this the wrong way, I think Sauder kids are immensely important to society. It just really pisses me off when I see them on campus looking down at people and walking around like they are somehow better than others. There is a reason you guys are called snakes cause learning how to survive in business is just APPLIED NATURAL SELECTION!! Your entire profession is predicated upon Forestry students conserving our precious wood so you guys can invest in more . I don't hate Sauder kids, I just need them to start showing some humility.

I hate to say this because I have friends who are Sauder kids... but at the end of the day you people are just taking trees that forestry kids are trying to save and cutting it down. Please don't take this the wrong way, I think Sauder kids are immensely important to society. It just really pisses me off when I see them on campus looking down at people and walking around like they are somehow better than others. There is a reason you guys are called snakes cause learning how to survive in business is just APPLIED NATURAL SELECTION!! Your entire profession is predicated upon Forestry students conserving our precious wood so you guys can invest in more . I don't hate Sauder kids, I just need them to start showing some humility.
-Sincerely,
A student who thinks you guys are better than this",,1542119880,,,109,102,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2165742020110746&id=1287650764586547,

Why do some people think its ok to waste food? That is so arrogant considering there are 795 million people going hungry in the world. My ex flatmate from China used to chuck volumes of food away all the time because she bought new food that wouldn't all fit in the fridge....seriously! I mean SERIOUSLY! I have just moved in with a Spanish couple who work in a sushi restaurant. They take home the leftovers every day at about 1am consisting of large amounts of raw salmon. I find this raw salmon on the side every morning (not the fridge) so by this time its unsafe to eat and then by the evening its in the bin. Shock. They never eat any of it! Oh it makes my blood boil. After verbal communication was not effective I got into the habit of chucking it in the bin myself every morning. Yes they were outraged. No they did not start to put it in the fridge. So if you're reading this and you're from Spain, work in a sushi restaurant, and live with a Little Angry Canadian Girl PLEASE either put the excess sushi in the fridge and EAT IT or don't take it at all. P.S. Little Angry Canadian Girls like free sushi","#10494

So far I’ve only found one secret room, where I’ve taken a nap a couple of times, but there have got to be more. Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone else of the UBC Confessions community, wish me luck as I embark on this quest.","#10491

I wish alcoholism and substance dependency was taken more seriously. I thought I was normal when drinking my ass off cus everyone else did too, till I realized was drinking all the time even alone cus I was depressed and super lost. For a year I downed heavy liquor every other day to feel better, I couldn’t imagine going a week sober, till I realized I had a problem and was driving myself into the ground. I got better, but now I suddenly realize that I’m turning to getting high the same way I used to turn to getting drunk. To forget about my problems and never deal with the underlying issues.
Like I guess sometimes it’s funny cus haha it’s university have fun right, but sometimes it really isn’t. I wish people took substance abuse more seriously and didn’t just laugh and call me “the alcoholic” of the friend group as a joke and only encouraged me to drink more.

The default dance is truly a masterpiece. Never, in all of history, has such an artistic masterpiece ever been created. The choreography is possibly the most beautiful sight ever beheld by the human eye. The sharp sound of the SLAP when the player’s hands collide perfectly with the beat of the song sends a bone chilling shiver down my spine, every single time I hear it. I find my self watching my in-game avatar performing this phenomenal dance ritual for hours on end. The beat of the song is without a doubt the most amazing musical composition in history, one to rival, if not surpass the complexity and beauty of Mozart’s classics. The default dance has truly revolutionized the future of music, and how artists should aspire to create. Some would describe the default dance as a meme, or just part of the game it is appearing in, however I would strongly disagree. These people simply do not understand that the default dance is the center of existence. The universe, science, and evolution are purely myths, as the default dance was the first life form to roam the Earth. Everything; human beings, nature, everything that defines this planet, has originated from ‘the building blocks of life’, the default dance.

I lost my mom to cancer right as school started 3 years ago. At that time I didn't know anyone at UBC since I was in 1st year, and my friends from secondary school were going to universities across the world. They tried their best to support me (and I am very thankful for that) but it's different having someone physically in front of you to talk to vs talking to them on the phone. It's also really hard to be separated from people you've practically grown up with for your entire life. I didn't want to mess up my first year so I guess I ended up repressing it. Even though it's 3 years later I feel like I haven't properly grieved. When someone asks me if I'm actually okay I just end up smiling and nodding, even though I want to tell them what I'm feeling. There's some stupid part of my brain that keeps telling me that it's been three years now and that I should have come to terms with it, since everyone in my family has seemed to move on. My dad has a new girlfriend now and seems happy. Tbh I just really miss my mom. Thanks for coming to my TED talk sorry for all the grammar/spelling mistakes.","#10442

Hey first years, I just wanted to send some words of encouragement. I know right now, making friends can seem so difficult and you feel like you're doing something wrong if you don't have any. Or maybe you're losing all your high school friends and don't know how to feel about it. It gets better. First, you have to start being OK with not constantly being with a friend. Being alone is OK too! Take some time to enjoy your own company and think of all the benefits that come with not having to deal with another person. Its not high school anymore, I know its a hard transition but you can't be so reliant on friends anymore. Second, start small. Maybe talk to that other kid in your lecture who always sits alone. I'm sure there are many others out there that also want friends. Maybe not all of them will like you and you'll face some cold rejections, but don't let that get you down. Join some clubs, join an exec team. SUS is well known for being cliquey but if you get in,instant friends.You can't get along with everyone. Third, high school friends will come and go. At the end of it when they have breaks and they still don't make an effort to see you or talk to you, then let them go. With distance, it can be hard to be as tight as before when you were constantly in their proximity. Everyone is busy as well. It hurts,I won't lie. It really hurts. Even now when I see some friends I lost, I feel a little bitter about the way they treated me. When I see them tagging and chatting with everyone except me, it hurt. But now as time has passed, I realize it doesn't matter. If they aren't willing to take the time out of their day to even reply properly to a single text, fuck it. They can leave. You're busy too, save your time for people who matter. Finally, remember your self worth isn't determined by the number of friends you have, or number of texts you receive, or amount of memes sent your way. Be happy being yourself. If you're truly struggling with mental health,try to seek help. Whether it be professional or otherwise. I always see a lot of people in the comment sections reach out. Try it maybe, UBC has kind and loving people. Good luck!","#10430

Finally, remember your self worth isn't determined by the number of friends you have, or number of texts you receive, or amount of memes sent your way. Be happy being yourself. If you're truly struggling with mental health,try to seek help. Whether it be professional or otherwise. I always see a lot of people in the comment sections reach out. Try it maybe, UBC has kind and loving people. Good luck!",,1540602436,,,101,3,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2136866739664941&id=1287650764586547,

I took some pictures and called the cafe, leaving a message, and giving them my number since I saw how one of the mice got inside. I haven't heard anything back. I wanted to warn people, but I also didn't want to cost them any business or have anyone be out of work if they need to hire an exterminator.

Currently I’m studying in the faculty of science as a first year and I don’t know if I want to switch programs...All the midterms and tests I’ve been doing, I’m in the 50-60’s range (even managed to fail a test or two...), comparing to the 90’s I got all throughout high school and lately it’s been making me rethink what I want to study. Like sciences are interesting and all that but I feel like I’m too stupid to continue on and that I’m only going to fail and get kicked out. And slowly because of that I feel like I’m losing interest in school and my enjoyment of science as a whole. I mean I don't mind learning the material and it's not like I hate what I'm learning but I just feel like I don't have the capability to succeed. I feel like my mental health is slowly going downhill because of this as well, I don’t think I’ve been this conflicted and sad before. I cry myself to sleep almost every night and I hate waking up for school. I study pretty hard too and I do all the homework and readings but still I end up doing not so well. Should I switch programs? I kind of am compelled to go into arts, just to try something new, but it might be too late to and it'll just be another mistake. My parents still want me to stick with science too even though I feel like I’m failing and don’t belong there. Should I still stick with sciences and persist through, hoping that it does get better in the future? I really don’t want to make the wrong decision and backtrack...but I also feel like such a disappointment and failure in life. Recently I’ve been feeling like nothing really matters anymore because I'm incapable...I don’t really know what to do or how to deal with this situation...","#10388

A few days ago I was waiting for a bus at the bus loop to leave campus. I finished a midterm slightly earlier in the day, and I was preparing for two midterms and a lab the day after and I had nothing else on my mind than other to focus on my exams. The bus came to unload, and a blind man exited with his stick. He asked for directions towards the Buchanan building (which is relatively far). For a while nobody in line answered him. I really wanted to help but I had midterms the next day and I was pressured, also the bus I wait for takes a little more time than usual to arrive. It’s a horrible excuse I know, but I had to leave as soon as I could. Another lady was also waiting ahead of me in line for the same bus as well. But she was so amazing to take time out of her schedule to kindly escort the man to the Buchanan building.
To that girl, I wanted to say thank you. People like you are what makes this campus so great. You showed so much care, respect, and class. Like me, I also am sure you probably had your own errands to run as well, but you happily told him you would take him there. You took time out of your busy schedule, and you were also waiting for the bus like I was but you put that mans needs ahead of yours. You were so sweet to tell him you would help him on his way and you held his arm and walked away. You comforted him and you did that man a huge service.

tl;dr: i'm in love with my friend and idk how to let go of my feelings
I developed a crush on my friend when we were in Gr. 10. She's one of my closes friends since mid-elementary school. We'll call her Neen because that's all my low-on-battery brain can come up with right now, sorry.
I'm pretty dense when it comes to romance, so I didn't realize it. I passed off the heart skips when we'd talk as ""Oh, it's just 'cus we're really close friends"". Now that I think back on it, it's as absurd as it sounds.
A year later, Gr. 11, I was talking to another friend about her crush, and when she asked me if I had feelings for anyone, I answered no. That night, when I thought back on our conversation, Neen popped into my mind. I thought of the way she's always there to support me, how the way she laughs never fucking fails to lift my mood and just, sitting across from each other, carrying on some ridiculous conversation. I realized that I'm not straight, which doesn't exactly impact me all that much, and then I realized that I'm never going to tell her my feelings.
We are both from Asian families. Specifically, our parents moved to Canada in search of a better life for our families. They've put in their life's work to try and build a better life for their children and, being quite Asian, there's no way our parents would allow for a queer relationship.
Even if I do risk it and open up to my parents about my sexuality, I'm likely to ruin my relationship with them over something absolutely trivial. They've given up their lives for me but I'm unable to make a sacrifice for them? I've heard the way they talk of homosexuals, and they talk even worse of bisexuals. Being omnisexual, I don't want to even imagine how they will react.
And even if my parents and her parents are alright with it, am I willing put our friendship, the relationship we've slowly built up over the years on the line for some confession? Perhaps she accepts it and we move on and all is great, but what if she doesn't? I'm terrified that if I open up and she rejects me, our friendship get awkward and dissipate.
Anyway, we entered UBC three years ago, and it only got worse. I was distracted from the classes we were in together because GODDAMN she's so beautiful. I attempted to flirt with her (badly) but she would give me that ""Are you kidding me"" (adorable) face and pass it off as a shit joke. Not to say that my jokes weren't shit, but, I digress. At some point, I started to think that the only way I was going to get over her was to, find someone else to crush on, or perhaps enter a relationship with. So I set off in my full glory wielding five dating apps, determined to find someone that I could love the way I love Neen.
And I found someone, somehow. We went on a couple dates and started texting each other a lot. Then he asked me out. I said yes. Everything's great and cue +1 couple on campus. We were holding hands on the way to dinner when a thought passed my mind. I thought, I wish it was Neen I was with.
Ever since then, Neen keeps on passing through my mind when I'm with my boyfriend. I know it's completely unfair to my boyfriend, but I just don't know what to do. I hated leaving him in the dark, so I told him of the situation. He wasn't happy. Of course he wasn't. But he asked me for some time to think, and that's been our relationship since: on break.
I dunno what I should do. If this actually gets posted, could I get some insight on some of the things I could do?","#10311
tl;dr: i'm in love with my friend and idk how to let go of my feelings
I developed a crush on my friend when we were in Gr. 10. She's one of my closes friends since mid-elementary school. We'll call her Neen because that's all my low-on-battery brain can come up with right now, sorry.
I'm pretty dense when it comes to romance, so I didn't realize it. I passed off the heart skips when we'd talk as ""Oh, it's just 'cus we're really close friends"". Now that I think back on it, it's as absurd as it sounds.

As someone who went through the formal recruitment process this year, I'd just like to say that for organizations that supposedly promote ""sisterhood"" and ""brotherhood"", UBC Sororities and UBC Fraternities do a really good job of shattering people's confidence. During Invitationals, the number of upset looking faces and crying girls I saw was astounding. For some people, not getting an ""invitation"" back to a sorority that they thought they had connected with during Tours is so disheartening, and I know this happens with the fraternity rush as well (to a lesser extent). Sororities are supposed to empower women, but the whole recruitment process is so contrived that it often seems to do the exact opposite. It's ridiculous that in some cases only certain individuals in the chapter have the final say in who gets invited back to each round. The same goes for the guys, as I know of many people who were convinced that they were going to receive bids and didn't. Overall, I just want to say to anyone who went through recruitment this year that whether you weren't invited back to a certain chapter/house, did not receive a bid, or anything else, you are not the only ones who have had this happen, so try your best not to take it personally. The greek system is probably one of the most exclusive clubs at UBC, and let's face it, it's pretty much the only ""club"" who gets to hand pick its members and charges them $1000 to join- a realization that I came to as I went through the process myself.","#10286

A fourth year science student here. My graduation is approaching and I'm lost. I've been wanting to do grad school since my first year and I did try to push myself towards that goal. But honestly, I am just an average student. I have an 82 gpa, a year of full-time research experience, and that's pretty much it.
After seeing those super passionate and talented students in my upper year classes, I realized that there are so many students who are more suitable than me to do research.
I will still apply to grad schools to give it a try. It's just when I look back at my past four years of uni life, I don't know if I was making right decisions. I put lots of efforts on studying(because I am not smart tbh), yet I am still not a straight A's student (grades do matter a lot in my field of study). I didn't prepare myself to go industry, and if I do go to work after graduation, it feels like my efforts on studying are totally wasted.

Seriously, do you see any program that has all your important courses with the lowest 4.3-star profs? Do you get to know researches and actually carry out a research in first year?
I feel sympathetic about Vantage students this year. Where’s our dear Fok? What? Kayli was replaced by a accent-carrying prof? Is that really a good way for international students to learn English? I heard about the stories from the juniors. It just does not sound like a students who pays 45 grands per year deserves.","#10232

If you look at my transcript or ask people who have class with me. Both will say that I am a good student.
Yet I hate university... a lot. I hate sitting in the same coffee shop staring at the same laptop scrolling through endless lecture slides. I hate the pedantic stresses and having my ego and self worth so rapped up in my GPA. I hate the fact that the only reason I need to do well in school is so i have the grades to get into the school after your post secondary school, school.
Most of all, I am just tired. I'm tired of all of it.
I acknowledge this is just a rediculously privileged problem to have and I really am thankful for everything I have. However I just don't know how I can do this for the next 3 years.
I have a feeling a lot of you feel the same way.
If not, maybe I really just shouldn't be here","#10226

I recently stopped talking to my ex for good. And as proud as I am of myself for saying that I feel like I haven't made much progress at all. I still have dreams of her and I still imagine having sex with her... It's actually kind of shitty. I could be watching porn and at the point of climax she pops into my head. And honestly I don't know how to feel about it. I know she's moved on and well she's living a happy a life (hopefully) I feel like complete shit for still being unable to move on. I want to move on and prove to myself that I'm a decent human being, or well at the very least gain some self respect for myself. But I can't seem to do. In fact I'm so caught up with her I currently don't see myself ending up with a girlfriend for a while. I've turned down a couple of people because I'm scared of using them as a substitute for her. I don't know what to do, and can't stop masturbating without thinking about her...","#10213

[Really long and poorly written]
Hey friend,
It’s me, the annoying fool.
You probably don’t want to talk to me anymore. That’s fine. I know you still read this page, so I guess this is my best last resort.
This is what I’ve always wanted to tell you but never had the courage to do so.
I’ve always looked up to you. Even as kids when we first met so long ago I’ve always admired how much smarter you are than me and better at [Activities]. Way before [GF] and [Friend2] you were the first person to ever truly be there for me. I remember all the times we hung out together, endured the 5am practices, studied together, and all of the times when you would take time out of your day to help me with whatever mess I got myself into. A lot of my best memories came from hanging out with you. Looking back, it was pretty selfish of me to just come to you for every problem I had. And yet, even with how busy you were, you would still do your best for me even though I never did best for myself. You were the person I could be honest about myself with. All the memories we made since grade 6 have made themselves a cozy home in my heart.
But now, it seems that I’m just that to you. A memory.
I don’t know what happened. Everything was fine and we talked every day for hours on end. But a few weeks before school started you became cold. You started talking to me less and less to the point of flat out ignoring me. And even when you did it was nothing like before, almost as if I was just another stranger to you. The 3 weeks before school started I asked if you wanted to hang out one last time before we went off on our own for 4 months. You said that you were busy. A few days later I asked again. You were busy. Time and time again my attempts at connecting with you were shut down by the fact that you’re “busy”. For a while I truly believed it. I trusted that once you had any free time, we would go out together like we always did. But I was wrong. You say you were busy but we both know that’s not true. I don’t know what I did to make it this way but I’m sorry I wasn’t worth your time.
Last week I was having suicidal thoughts. I didn’t want to bother you so I stayed quiet for a few days. It didn’t last long. Being alone with your thoughts is the worst thing you could do in that situation. Sitting alone in a pool of self doubt, insecurity, feelings of inadequacy, and soul crushing despair until I finally broke. I felt like if there was one person in the world I could confide in it would be you. So I did. When you replied to that with, “idk man😕 think for yourself”, I knew I was dead to you. I had suspected it for the longest time yet i still clung on to the slightest hope that maybe, you still thought of me as your friend. Hearing that only confirmed my suspicions. I’ll be honest, that probably should have killed me. I felt at that point, more confident than ever, that the best thing to do was kill myself. Funnily enough, the night after I had a dream that we were hanging out again and doing what we used to do. In classic [you] style, you made a terrible pun. I laughed and it felt like what I was going through in the real world was just a bad dream. I thought to myself, “of course it was just a bad dream, why would my best friend do that to me?”. I was so happy I laughed so hard that I woke up. I exited the heaven of the dream world to return to the hellish nightmare of reality. I didn’t want to bother you and I’m sorry I did.
So now I guess we go our separate ways. I had hoped this day would never come and we would grow old together and sit around and talk about old man things and reminisce about our adventures. But I guess that’s out of the picture now. I sincerely appreciate all the times you’ve helped me and I treasure our friendship. I’m sorry I wasn’t good enough.
I’m sorry for everything. I’ve been a really bad friend. I will try my best to move on while still keeping the memories we made together. But know that even after everything, I may not be your best friend anymore, but you will always be mine.
I promise one day I will make you proud to be my friend. Or I’ll die trying.
Tl;dr: Op explains how pathetic and a bad friend he is for getting overly attached and clingy to someone who never liked him in the first place but was too dumb to realize it sooner and over dramatizes every little problem.","#10211

As a first year on mendatory meal plan, I've been planning my eating carefully based on the amount of rez dollar and flex dollar in the plan. So last time when I was at the corner store, I saw the bakery carring the exact same stuff as the ones from rez cafe, so I asked the cashier (possibly the manager) if those purchases would be counted toward flex or rez, I was tbinkning if it's ex, I would ratherx buy it at rez cafe. He said he would check for me, then simply went on to carry out the transaction. He said impatiently that was the only way to check - paying first and then log on to my scc to see where the money is deducted from. I was quite upset and thanked him sarcastically. He replied: you are welcome, welcome to UBC! It certainly unmade my day.
The twist is, when I logged on to SCC a few days later, no record of such a transaction can be found. For some reason it didn't go through, and no money is deducted from either account. LOL!","#10210

My boyfriend doesn’t come from a truly super rich family but his dad still pulls in close to 300-350k a year and from what I know he has never had to work a day in his life because his dad just pays for everything. Me, I have to work to have any spare cash and there’s no way I can afford my boyfriends lifestyle. The problem is that my boyfriend doesn’t understand the value of money and he just buys me boba tea and lattes every time we meet without me asking (I love the drinks though and it’s so sweet of him to do it and buy it before we meet) or takes me out to dinner and lunch. He always pays and that makes me feel bad because I don’t contribute anything financially and I don’t even offer to pay because I can’t afford it. Lately though he hasn’t been happy that he pays for everything and is increanslgy hinting at me to buy him something but is that fair because I have to work for my spare cash while my boyfriend just texts his dad for money and his dad without question gives him the money. He’s not short on money and he can afford the stuff he wants me to buy him with a simple text message. He just doesn’t understand that not everyone can text their dad for free money and he doesn’t understand that some people truly would have their bank accountant go to $0 if they lived his life . I am sure he’s a nice person and would t want to harm me but he just doesn’t get or understand money and that’s causing him to misunderstand me","#10208

So last year I took a beginners level course in a South Asian language. The lecturers we had were brilliant and everyone enjoyed the class. Because UBC wanted to expand this language programme and had a goal of over the next few years offering a wide range of courses in this language up to the 400 level, they were looking to employ a permanent professor to run this language programme and teach the beginner level and intermediate courses in it this year. So they interviewed three profs and each one taught us a class and afterwards we had to fill out feed back forms on the profs performance. Two of the profs were brilliant and one was a complete disaster who had no idea what he was doing, so needless to say we gave him very low ratings. Who did UBC employ? The awful train wreck of a prof who now not only is teaching courses in this language but other Asian studies courses as well. He is very rude to his students, insults them, and does not actively teach, all he uses are awful PowerPoints presentations that never work properly. He is so bad that so many people have dropped the courses he teaches specifically because of him. He has completely destroyed the language programme of this south Asian language, and because so many people have dropped the courses because of him, the 300 level and 400 level courses probably won’t be offered now in upcoming years because there will be nobody left to take them! Despite numerous complaints made against him to the Asian studies department, they have repeatedly said that there is ‘nothing’ they can do about it. I would have thought that one of the best universities in Canada would have employed good lecturers, instead it seems they employ any random person.","#10205

Meanwhile, they parents cook all of their meals, prepare them a lunch, wash the dishes, do their laundry, and go grocery shopping.
I understand that many people who commute also have to do all of those things, but if you live at home with your parents, within a reasonable distanc, and they do all the housekeeping for you, your life is not actually significantly more difficult than someone who lives on campus and has to do all that stuff for themself.

I didn't particularly think that birthdays are super special, but this year, I realized that deep inside I still consider it special. This year, all my closest friends forgot about my birthday and I felt like I was forgotten as well. I didn't expect any surprises nor gifts at all, but I also didn't expect everyone to forget about it. I would appreciate the ""hey hbd"" (and the prayers that comes with it cause I believe in the power of prayers), but there was no such thing.
I know it's been months, but I can't seem to forget about it. The memory just comes back and it is painful every now and then. I never really talk to them about how I feel, because I don't want to guilt-trip them. Even I hate myself for feeling this way. I know I should forgive them because it's such a trivial matter and it's not worth the conflict, but everytime I remember, it hurts me even more. Any advice?","#10200

So I used to think that silver box in the unisex restrooms around campus was just a convinent garbage bin so I used to sometimes just throw stuff inside it. But today I opened it to throw some toilet paper in it and i saw a used diaper pad with blood on it. That’s when I figured out this silver box is probably for girls only to dump their period products and not a general garbage bin. I guess this is what happens when you didn’t grow up with any sisters to have made that higher level analysis/thinking on what that could be because I never grew up with these products in the bathroom I shared with my brother. If any girls on campus ever opened it and saw like chocolate wrappers, toilet paper etc , SORRY that may have been me and I didn’t mean to be a dick","#10199

It's amazing how emotional highs can lead to the bedroom, because I always have them in the sheets the next morning. You can call me an abuser, but I disclose my personality and tendencies whenever I begin seeing someone. I push good, smart women away only for them to beg for another chance. When they leave me, I'll respect their choice and move on. I feel bad for all the men who don't have the looks, smarts, and privilege to pull off emotional abuse.

I'm not sure if this is considered a confession or a rant. But I just really wanted to make a post about fake a$$ friends.
So my ex and I broke up last year around this time. Needless to say, it was not a good break up and he was pretty hurt by it. I have to admit I didn't handle things well and I did not completely end things with him before starting something up with another guy. Ofcourse, through this all I was confiding in a few of my girlfriends because I was feeling very lost and confused about a lot of things in my life. Everything I said was SUPPOSED to be kept in confidence.
But alas, a few of my girlfriends decided I wasn't ""treating my ex right"" and decided to completely stab me in the back. They asked me to confide in them over text about my situation and how I felt and they screenshotted those texts and sent them to my ex. One girl even went as far as to ask my new guys friends what exactly was going on with our relationship to report to my ex. I have to say I'm entirely disappointed at how snakey and hypocritical some of my girlfriends turned out to be. One of the girlfriends in particular has a very troubled past with guys, she has cheated on almost all her boyfriends, had an affair with a middle aged teaching assistant in her program AND a middle aged yoga instructor. Throughout all this and also her manic depressive episodes that led her to be in and out of the hospital...I have always been a caring and supportive friend. Honestly, I do not know what I did to deserve this. But this girl of all people has no right to judge me because she has done so much worse. I guess all in all it's a blessing in disguise to be rid of these toxic people in my life. I'm a lot happier now and have definitely moved on from this situation.
Ok rant over. Moral of the story: beware of snake friends.","#10130

I trust her to not cheat, but somewhere deep down I get this uneasiness feeling (perhaps jealousy) and I don't know what to do to cope with this feeling. She dosen't seem to know that I have this feeling as I show that I'm fine with it all the time.

I came to UBC with a really close friend. I would say she's basically like my best friend, at least I thought she was. I've known her for almost 12 years, and when we came over to UBC, I was super excited and we made lots of plans about joining clubs together, travelling etc. But lately, I felt that she doesn't really reciprocate the friendship anymore. It started with her kinda ditching me last minute? We would have plans and suddenly on that day she'll not want to come anymore. Whenever I go anywhere really (eg. festivals, bars, dinner etc.) I'll always extend an invitation to her. But whenever she makes plans, I'm usually not included. Whenever she needs help, she doesn't really have to ask for it, I'll offer it. Like when she said that she couldn't understand the class material, I automatically offered about 2 hours of my time to go through it with her. But when I needed help, I'll have to ask for it if not she pretty much ignores me.
It really sucks, cause I thought that coming to a new environment with a friend would mean a better experience. I was really looking forward to a good university experience with all the plans and 'promises' we made together. I feel kinda pathetic for constantly trying to maintain our friendship while it feels like she doesn't want to be associated with me or something. And it pains me to think that this is someone I trusted and thought I was close to.","#10103

Met a Asian girl, talked to her for about a week before getting her number. She made herself sound like a smart, classy and trustworthy young lady. I didn't tell her I don't drive. Fast forward to the weekend we decided to meet up. However as Im walking to our meeting spot I see her get out of the backseat of a car, the guy gets out after adjusts his pants and drives off. Wtf is wrong with you females ? If you're sleeping around just admit it. Not only do you look like a liar when you get caught , but I'll pretend like I didn't see anything order half the menu excuse myself to the bathroom after eating and drinking 150 dollars worth and CUT.

Soooooo after being single for four years and not really a person that's into hookups I was forced to use tinder. Was always under the assumption that everyone's just on there to hump. Met a Asian girl, talked to her for about a week before getting her number. She made herself sound like a smart, classy and trustworthy young lady. I didn't tell her I don't drive.

She couldn't lift the weight and was slowly collapsing under it so I came from behind and lifted her and the bar together.

I came to UBC last year from out of province as THAT guy, the one who never dated in secondary school and was afraid to ask girls out his entire 18 years ( going on 19 now) on the planet. In my Econ class, I met this insanely cute korean girl. We talked a little bit here and there. After the midterm, she saw my mark, a solid 99.5/100 ( this was my first ever university exam). Then she said more than once we should study together for the next time and for other classes that we shared in common. I never took her up on this though, because I was too nervous. This was uncharted territory for me. Was I going to just be a friend of hers and nothing more ( just like every other female friend I have), or could this be the stepping stone to something more? Now that was last November. I've seen her in Buchanan walking by a few times the last sem, and I've thought time and time again about just messaging her on facebook to kickstart conversation. Yet, doing that would be uncharted territory for me. Any other guys have similar experiences? Or will I be forever trapped. I want to get going, but I feel stuck in this trap while the whole world is passing me by. I feel like I gotta get moving, but every time the thought of reaching out to her crosses my mind I'm paralyzed by fear of what is to come.","#10022

Its even worse in the dating world. Today I matched with a girl on bumble who’s first message to me was telling me I’m way tok skinny to make out with her. Stuff like that just kills me cause i know thats what most girls probably think when they see me, finally someone just said it. That message ruined my self confidence so much ive deleted bumble and tinder. I know people are gonna say “just eat more and go to the gym” but its not that easy. For a lot of people like me genes arent on their side and they may be too busy to workout all the time to gain weight.

Sometimes I become acutely aware of the extent of my dehumanization – when I realize that my entire life identity is predicated on measures of success in my career, academics, and finances, and I stumble through each day with only the roughest approximation of how to act normal. I live for certifications, credentials, prestige, salary, and authority, and now in turn those entities drive the life behind my eyes. Each morning I stare into the crack in my car’s bumper and fantasize about squeezing myself into it, to force my piecemeal mind and body to vanish into the crevice and be discarded to the abyss so I may forsake all remaining aspects of my identity and start anew. My emotional and cognitive dissonance has reached its apex. My daily interactions with my subordinate employees at work are marred with ill-concealed contempt, boredom, disgust, and fear. A crude sense of apathy takes a hold of me constantly, no longer blunted by my alcohol and marijuana usage. I fear I am losing control of my sanity. Something is unravelling inside of me, and it makes me deeply uneasy. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.","#9996

My emotional and cognitive dissonance has reached its apex. My daily interactions with my subordinate employees at work are marred with ill-concealed contempt, boredom, disgust, and fear. A crude sense of apathy takes a hold of me constantly, no longer blunted by my alcohol and marijuana usage. I fear I am losing control of my sanity. Something is unravelling inside of me, and it makes me deeply uneasy. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.",,1531194240,,,79,45,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1977162372302046&id=1287650764586547,

I was jerking off in my living room a couple months ago, as one does. And I climaxed just as my roommate’s car pulled up. I usually just tummy it then kinda waddle to the bathroom. Panicked, I instead reached for the closest makeshift towel. My roommates toque.
I only managed to huck in across the room and boot up the box before he walked in, as not to raise suspicion. He walks in and we swap playing fort for a good hour. He gets up and says he’s gotta run, that he has a date. He grabs his toque off the floor and heads out.
The morning after some girl is walking around wearing his toque pulled up really high like douches do. I said “nice toque” trying to make the situation of her randomly being in my kitchen wearing a semen filled hat less awkward. She said she was wearing it like that because of an inside joke.
The real joke inside is them.","#9990

My gf is a diagnosed sex addict. And this has been ruining my life in the past 2 years I've been with her. I thought we were finally getting somewhere when she didn’t have sex for the past month (as we are separated for summer).
But she just texted me that she wants to break up and that she is going to cheat on me. I asked her why but she just told me she just wants to fuck so badly (no one in particular). She may seem cruel but when I’m with her, she’s the nicest, cutest and the hottest girl I’ve ever known. But whenever she’s left alone for a period, she can’t stop cheating on me.
This also happened last summer and she hid the fact that she cheated until she decided to confess. And I’m not blaming her too much because I wasn’t the best boyfriend at the time, she’s the one who made me a better person, motivated me to study harder, take care of myself and even showed me what love really is. I never had a connection this deep with anyone. She (and I) was depressed for weeks because of the cheat. We went through a major change and she actually didn’t cheat on me since which was very new for her. She also tried to make up for it by letting me have 3ways with her here and there.
I know she’s going to see this post and I don’t know what to do now. She tells me that I don’t understand how much she “doesn’t have control over physical desires”. But at the same time, I can tell how much this break up is hurting her, and she’s doing this for my good. I really don’t want to break up an I know she’s ok with being open for summer but that’s not I want and she doesn’t want to hurt me that way. At least she still hasn’t done it.","#9976

I find it mind boggling that a person who got well below average in a course managed to get a position as a TA, while students who got well above average and have decently written applications were flat out rejected. I speak for the large majority of students who were passed despite having clear mastery of material.
I understand that being a TA is about teaching and not just about getting a high mark, but I just don't understand why they would prioritize people who clearly don't understand the material themselves over students who know what they are talking about and aren't half assing what they are saying to current students taking the course.
While I certainly do agree that a student with an 80 could be more fit to TA than a student with a 95+ possibly due to a more aligned mindset, choosing students who barely passed the course but have a ""bubbly personality"" is absolutely ridiculous. A bubbly personality can only go so far until you start teaching students the wrong concepts and negatively impact the reputation of the course as a whole, and possibly the entire department if the situation is bad enough. Students look to TA's in office hours for help, and when TA's give them help and teach them concepts, it's kind of given that a certain level of trust is already there. Betraying that trust is probably one of the scummiest things I've ever seen. I know people aren't perfect, but you should have come into this position with at least some background of what you're talking about.
It's possible that my views are negatively biased, but I'm quite fed up with this. Just had to let this out, because I'm sick and tired of seeing reddit posts/comments of people who are clearly qualified to be a TA, getting rejected, and losing confidence in themselves. One person wrote that he was rejected three times in a row. I get the feeling that he would have made a great TA, but he might not be able to get the chance, because some fake ass politician looking applicant showed up to the department's front step dressed in a $1000 suit somehow deluded the idiodic committee into giving him/her the responsibility that he/she clearly cannot handle.
I may be delusional and losing my mind. If so, feel free to bash me in the comments for submitting this and knocking some sense into me. Just had to get it out of my system. Absolutely ridiculous that this is happening. Not sure if I'm just getting paranoid or something.","#9956

To: the f boy with a soul
You are perfect.
And I think the reason why girls constantly fell for you left and right, was because you viewed her as a person.
To you , she had no flaws. And the ones she had, you accepted. Maybe her flaws presented no challenge because you weren’t really into her (therefore they didn’t really matter), but it’s addicting to have someone accept you when you can’t even accept yourself.
Why do you keep lying to the people that are so into you?
Why are you willing to create pain for girls who would do anything to just sit beside you?
How do you give a girl everything yet still not actually give a s*** about her?
Everything has no purpose and no meaning. The world looks pretty grey and bleak. Why do we sleep? To survive. Why do we eat? To survive. Why do we breathe? To survive.
And then you happened into my life.
And everything just brightened. I live on 4 hours of sleep every night, because the thought of you races nonstop and constantly in my mind.
I can listen endlessly to your voice on the phone, because I am content with just hearing the sound of you. I am now the most spontaneous and fun person, all thanks to you!!!
I genuinely wanted to live. Not because you gave me a reason. You were the reason.
Pulling me out of depression? That was all you. I saw someone who actually LOOKED at me and saw the real me rather than what society has told girls to be.
You filled my head with hopes and dreams. I wanted to stop trying so bad. Could I give up right now? But as soon as I said that you were ‘so disappointed mad angry’ I did everything I could to match what you wanted and somehow it still wasn’t enough.
I am so so so confused. Because what your eyes and words said were completely different than how you acted.
And that’s the reason you lie. Because for a girl, any person really, to want you to the extremes, that’s what you thrive off of. Knowing you aren’t alone, knowing that someone will always want you even when you thought no one did , that’s the thought that destroyed you long before me.
Thank you for giving me everything. Thank you for showing me what it should actually be like. Thank you for setting the standards high. Thank you for showing me this bulls*** called love because without you? I would have never felt so full. So satisfied and depressed and confident yet fucked up at the same time.
Last reminder: you are so perfect.
and you deserve to be loved way more than I could have ever given you. Any girl who even gets to spend an hour with you is the luckiest girl in the world.
I just wished you saw yourself the way I saw you. Maybe then you wouldn’t have hurt so many girls, enough to form a support group.

This is going to enrage a lot of people, but I am just going to say it… I HATE BIKES and by extension BIKE PEOPLE. There are many reasons for this, but here are the primary ones:
1 – On Transit, whether it be on the bus or sky train, they slow down the bus or take up considerable space, respectively. This is especially troublesome when someone is having trouble putting their bike on the bus rails. It is bad enough to barely find room on a packed sky train, but when a bike person comes along and expects people to move in order to accommodate one person and their bike, well tough luck, the train was meant to transport people not your damn bike. Not to mention I see a decent chunk of them just running up and down the stairs with their bikes, which is major hazard. In other countries people just leave their bikes in secure areas outside the station, not bring it along for a ride, would I bring a horse onto the sky train? HECK NO.
2 – On campus, a lot of bike people are maniacs, zooming past any and every available space they can find, usually in between unknowing pedestrians, even if some areas on campus are marked as pedestrian priority (i.e. outside Buchanan). I mean hey yes you are in a rush, but why not walk and enjoy the scenery, I am just surprised I do not see more accidents happen on campus.
3 – All the stupid bike lanes in Van, the streets are already crowded and
sometimes dangerous, but heck a lot of the bike only lanes are not even used. The road would be such a better place if at least some of those lanes were removed and driving lanes were widened I mean come on, is it just because the mayor likes to bike? I really do not understand the point of some of them.
4 – The ULTIMATE REASON I hate bikes, when driving me and many other drivers often encounter bikes and although they have their own lane and you are suppose to treat them like other vehicles, they constantly swerve, switch in and out of the street and side walk, which no other vehicle can do and sometimes they just go in the middle of the road, not the bike lane, but the road acting like a vehicle with little regard for the cars that are going 50 Km/h and can run them over.
OVERALL I do not like bikes and believe Vancouver would be a better place if they were more restricted, hate me if you must, but I said what I wanted to say and that is it.","#9916

It took me 20 years to made me realize that not everyone can like me, and also I don’t have to force the person to like me. It maybe sound foolish but I always tried so hard to make all the people like me. I tried to ask this person who used to be my best friend why she stopped talking to me, and she would never tell me why (which make sense because she “stopped talking” to me literally lol). At the time I was so hold up to the idea that there’s someone who doesn’t like me and I cannot fix myself to be likable to her. But after about few years, I started to realize I shouldn’t be hold up to something that is toxic to myself and also the person. Thinking about why this person wouldn’t talk to me just make me more stressed on top of what’s going on in my life. Also they have their own life and sometimes they really don’t even care about me and what happened but it was just myself overthinking all the time. I always apologize for anything I did wrong, but if they don’t want to talk to me after all the forgiveness and such, then I think I should just move on from it and don’t think about it too much. People really do come and goes. Now it’s hard to move on because of the social medias and you can literally see them all the time in the internet, but I think one mindset can change everything. I just wanted to share this with others because I realize this is something so many people are stressed about. And also wanted to hear the opinions about this! Thank you :)","#9910

UBC course review is biased because it is given before final exams and our course grades even though final exams are part of the course. As a result there is an incentive for instructors to change their attitude after course evlutations (e.g. no more office hours during exam season) and give very hard final exams without fear. Over the years I have learned that it no longer makes sense to give high ratings because there is a chance we get trolled during the final exam season but by giving lower rating one can only stand to gain because you can't make a loss and won't face the case where you get trolled hard despite giving a good review. This creates an adverse selection too . I still regret giving high ratings in my math 221 and math 220 :(","#9892

I’ve never told anyone this full story, but UBCC seems as good a place as any to share it. TL;DR I’m a real shitty person.
Last spring I met a (much) older man. We began speaking through an online anonymous application, and eventually made plans to meet each other. Our interactions were not innocent with talks of potentially more to come if we consented to it. We were also both painfully aware of each other’s, and our own, age. I didn’t care.
We met and soon delved into a whirlwind of sex, pleasure, and surprisingly, friendship. I lost my virginity (both) to him, and frankly I don’t regret it. In bed we shared a Dominant-Submissive relationship; I surprisingly enjoyed being thoroughly used by him, but the cuddles afterwards in which I snuggled up next to him and fell asleep mumbling nonsense were my favourite. He later told me that napping with me was the highlight of his week, and he liked how I felt safe and comfortable enough with him to just fall asleep. Outside of bed we discovered how our humour matched, and that we actually liked listening to each other talk. It seemed like we got along perfectly. I was extremely open with him, and I thought that he was the same.
The summer passed just like that, with him driving over an hour sometimes, to fetch me and “hang out”. Suddenly our “summer fling” began to creep into the start of the new school year, but neither of us had any inclination to stop. I would end up spending more nights sleeping over in his bed than in mine. Mind, it’s not like we had sex all night (only sometimes). We would simply chat sometimes, or watch a movie together. In all honesty, spending so much time with him instead of focusing on my studies was probably a bit detrimental to my grades. At that time, I just cared about seeing him and spending time with him.
One day I started questioning if I had feelings for him. I tried to convince myself that it couldn’t possibly be the case--I wasn’t allowed to harbour romantic interest for him as I knew it could never come to fruition. But the more I tried to tell myself I didn’t like him, the more I knew I did. If I didn’t, why did I feel so hurt when I saw that he was looking for another fwb (without telling me of his plans)? Then one night while wrapped up in his arms, as he was sound asleep behind me, I realized what that overwhelming feeling in my chest was. I was in love with him. I quietly cried myself to sleep that night.
I asked him once if he would ever consider being in a relationship again. He just laughed me off like my question was inane. I knew from the beginning that I could never have his heart, as he just did not have enough of it to give to me. Each and every piece was already allocated to a specific person in his life. I was at the bottom of his list of priorities, with him choosing to play games over spending time with me. And I understood why that was the case. After all, I was just some girl that recently popped into his life. It wasn’t really supposed to last as long as it did, but it’s not like I could disrupt the routine he had going for the last several years. But I’ll be the first to admit that I am a petty person and hated that I understood why I would never be picked first.
Christmas rolled around, and all of a sudden he was MIA. It’s a family holiday, yes, but he seemingly could not spare a single moment even after promising me that we’ll spend time together to only keep me around waiting all day, and then blowing me off at the last second.
I was at his one morning, and an unexpected visitor, a “friend” of his, asked to be let in. He seemed agitated, and wouldn’t tell me who SHE is. He asked me to sneak out the back so that SHE would not see me. But it was too late. He eventually went out to speak to HER and came back some time later. He would not tell me anything.
Some time later, during which he was visibly unhappy and would blow me off more frequently, he finally told me: SHE **was** his best friend. They had basically been dating a while back but broke up because they did not have convergent life plans. So they decided to stay best friends with the one rule that they would tell each other if they had someone in their life. He slept with HER a little while ago, but thought that it would be a one-off thing, and did not tell me about it. SHE turned up that morning because she wanted to give dating him another go. He was forced to finally tell HER about me. TL;DR they were no longer on speaking terms. He felt guilty about it all.
I ended up working out the math with the time frames he had given me. When they broke up was about the time that we began speaking to each other online. When they slept together was during Christmas, when he would not see me.
It felt like I was simply a placeholder for HER. That I was some body to satisfy his sexual cravings while SHE dated around to find someone that fit her life plans. I could see, feel, and hear how much hurting HER, hurt him. That he felt guilty that he was a little happy with me and that he could laugh with me. It wasn’t that he didn’t have enough heart to give anymore; his heart just would never be given to me. I wondered if the pain inside my chest was what heartbreak felt like.
There have been many occasions when I wondered if that day was the day I decided to end it all between us. Each time he blew me off after promising to see me, I thought about that being it. All those nights of me crying myself to sleep and waking up to puffy eyelids, I thought about that being the last time I would cry about him.
Funny how time makes you numb. I guess I would rather take up all the pain, and cry myself to sleep every night, if it meant I could be with him. In whatever way I could.
Eventually true realization set in that my feelings for him would never be returned the way I wanted them to be. Or maybe I just stopped seeing him through rose-coloured lenses. So I started dating someone my age. Unfortunately I still went to see him every now and then because I am a horrible person and did not know how to let anyone go. After telling him about my relationship and how I wanted to stop “us”, he told me that he would hate it if we stopped, that maybe something more could come out of us if we continued. Those were probably the only magic words that could have gotten me to agree, without promising me anything.
So I go on dates and see my boyfriend, who does not know anything. And the next day I’m tied up in the older man’s bed.
I was never able to tell anyone in my life about this older man. Even if I knew that they would not purposely pass judgement on me, I know that everyone would naturally be judgemental. Especially right now.
Throughout all of this, I have never told a single soul the whole story. And now, whoever is reading this, you have seen it.","#9877

Its only after graduation after 4 years in Vancouver that I realized this is actually quite a pretty city with Stanley Park and Granville Island. Thanks to UBC always giving me exams on the last days of exam season I never had a chance to really explore Vancouver as my only chance was after my exams but with UBC ALWAYS giving me exams on the last few days and not being a resident of Vancouver (which requires me to leave Vancouver during Christmas and the summer) it leaves really little time to explore between the start of the holiday and my last exam during each final exam season. Suffice to say, at least I finally visited Stanely Park and wish I had visited there a few more times during my stay in Vancouver. I may have graduated as one of the top students where people think I accomplished a lot but I really feel empty in having never seen Vancouver or BC.","#9844

I may have graduated as one of the top students where people think I accomplished a lot but I really feel empty in having never seen Vancouver or BC.",,1527872401,,,51,7,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1921522664532684&id=1287650764586547,

Seriously, what is with Asian parents calling their kids fat? Everything is fat fat fat, but I can't skip meals because it's ""bad for my health"" and instead I have to exercise. Every time I am too busy to go to the gym or run, I get the STINK EYE and the constant repetition of ""you're fat and lazy that's why that fat ass isn't going anywhere"". I'm a naturally curvy girl, so I do have a bit of meat on my bones; but my BMI is completely normal and I look nowhere near the word ""fat"". I'm so sick of this constant wear and tear of my self-esteem, like when I wear a dress I like and all I get is ""omg you look fat"". Like, WOW THANKS, as if you haven't already told me this about everything else that I wear! Despite consciously knowing that I'm alright, many years of hearing this has really taken a toll on my self-esteem. Even when other people tell me that I'm not fat, I feel the invisible pressure of my parents and their fat-shaming (EVEN THOUGH, again, I AM NOWHERE CLOSE TO BEING FAT. Besides, what's wrong with just being happy and healthy and NOT BEING A STICK????? Not that stick-thin people are bad, mind you. All body shapes are perfectly fine.) I'm not the only one who suffers from this treatment either! So many Asian girls seem to have the same problem somehow?? @Asian parents, LET YOUR DAMN DAUGHTERS LIVE. How tf do you have the NERVE to then tell us to be confident when it's literally you ppl sabotaging our self-esteem??? Jesus fuckin Christ!","#9840

My friends are so afraid of talking about any political on WeChat because people have been arrested for calling Xi names on WeChat in Mainland China. And the saddest part is most Chinese people do not care about these basic human rights! They only care about their own grades, their own wealth, their own family, etc. Of course, there are exceptions. I am happy that I have few friends from Hong Kong who also recognize China’s problems. But for the rest of you people from Mainland China, wake up!!! Xi Jinping has eliminated presidential term limits!! China is having a dictator now! China is becoming more like North Korea!

It started with a crush on this guy in one of my labs last semester. My first interaction with him wasn’t in lab though. He was also in my lecture section and at the start of the semester he caught me staring. He played it cool and smiled at me – I kept a straight face and turned away quickly because I was suuuper embarrassed and mad at myself for not being subtle. Fast forward to the second or third lab and we ended up working on a peer review together. We worked on a couple of these together actually – and I started to develop feelings for him. He was really easy going, friendly, talkative, intelligent, funny, and handsome – oh and a little flirty (or maybe that was just my wishful thinking?).
As the semester went on, I began to wonder if he had any feelings for me. He seemed to be super friendly with everyone so it was difficult to tell (At this point, I think I began convincing myself that he did like me).
Around the middle of the semester after one of our labs, I walked out with him and asked him how he was doing with the problem set for that week. He told me he actually finished it early because he was going skiing that weekend (I laughed – it was funny because the problem set involved ski trails). I told him that I was having some trouble with it and he offered to help me – so I asked him if I could add him on Facebook. He told me that he didn’t use facebook (weird) and gave me his number instead (also weird because he didn’t bother to ask for my number) and told me to text/call him. I didn’t end calling or texting as I eventually figured the problem set out on my own.
For the rest of semester, we casually talked here and there. After talking with a few friends and also convincing myself, I told myself that I would tell him how I felt and ask him out at the end of the semester.
I finally gathered the courage and I called him 2 weeks after finals. I was very straightforward and I told him I had a huge crush on him and that I liked being around him. I also said that I would like to know him better by becoming friends and hanging out. He told me that he would be cool with hanging out with me but that he did have a girlfriend and added that he appreciated that I told him I liked him because girls usually don't initiate and that he was really flattered. He also said he really does want to be my friend and that he hopes there are no hard feelings.
Right after the conversation my eyes welled up with tears and I cried for 40 minutes straight. Then I cried some more. That was the first time I really put myself out there, and although I got shut down, I’m glad I did it because at least I won’t be left wondering… and hey, maybe I just made myself a good friend – or potential friend I should say, as I’m not sure I can be friends with him right away.","#9820

I just wanna say that it’s not okay to use gay as a derogatory term. Despite being in university I still hear so many people use this term. Many of us who struggle with coming out struggle because of this...

One of the most appalling things about UBC is the sheer number of students who have never held a real job. A university degree is no longer a unique acquisition, so I'm confused why some people think that upon graduating they will instantly land a six-figure salary in the job of their dreams. Enjoy the freedom of uni while it lasts and try to not melt in the real world, ya snowflakes ❄","#9700

The cleaning staff in the first year residences have got to be the nicest group of people I've encountered here so far. I always feel bad having to walk through an area where they're working, but they still always greet me with a smile and ask me how things are going.
It really hits me in the gut to walk down the stairs or get on the elevator and see to-go boxes of disgusting food and trash just thrown everywhere, knowing they're going to have to scrub that sauce from custom bowl off the elevator floor again. The worst is always Fridays and Saturdays. I've never snitched on any partiers, or crashed anyone's fun for being loud, but if I see someone just dropping their trash, rest assured it's going down the back of their shirt. To everyone in OC, Totem, Vanier, and any other communal area who just leaves their trash laying out, I send the sincerest fuck you. Your parents may have allowed this shit, but it is seriously infantile to think nothing of those who have to encounter your mess in PUBLIC. Your group of friends may think you're funny, but the rest of us are unimpressed.
And if you want to hit me with the completely predictable ""It's their job anyway, that's what they're paid for."" schtick, I can guarantee you if your boss dropped a nice pile of extra work on your desk as you're packing to leave on Friday night, or your professor added some shit to the midterm they didn't teach until the last half of the class before, you would be the FIRST to complain on this confessional page or anonymously suck your own dick on Piazza about how YOU were treated unfairly and/or that's why it should be graded differently.
If you DO pick up after yourself, good luck on finals. Thanks for being a decent person.","#9695

Me and my boyfriend has been together for almost 2 years now. Things are going great and honestly, I love him so much. We have a great chemistry together and I couldn't have asked for a better partner. There is one thing about him tho, that kinda idk..bothers me. So he believes a guy and a girl can't be just friends. I used to have a really close guy friend since high school and we used to be really tight. After I got together with him, we stopped hanging out and I mean, I understand it. When you're in a relationship you are most likely to spend more time with your significant other. But when my friend used to message me to talk, or asked to hang out my boyfriend used to get realllllllllllllly salty.He thinks a guy friend is just someone whos tryna get into your pants. He used to be like how would you feel like I hung out one on one with a girl. And I mean, I thought about it and I seriously don't mind! (as long as the girl aint hotter than me hahah jk). There was this one time when I hung out with my friend which I thought would be okay because I had been talking bout it with my bf. But after I hungout he was so shady. Later, he made me choose between him and my friend and honestly Im such a fucking bad friend because I chose him. After then I stared ignoring my friends text more, and when he was going through a rough time, although I did talk to him then, I wasnt giving gim my 100% and after that I basically left him hanging mid talk and never got back to him. Its been a year since Ive last talked with him and whenever I see him posting pictures and idk see his instagram, I feel so fucking lonely. I really miss my friend but I really love my boyfriend too. And I know ya'll are gonna be like ""But if he really loves you then he should be doing what makes you happy"" This goes both ways. I really love him whats why Im doing what makes him happy. But damn I miss my friend!","#9694

About three weeks ago I was at the mall and saw this girl who looked kinda cute sitting by herself drinking a milkshake. I seriously never approach girls but I don't know I was feeling motivated and shit that day and went for it. Since then we've been hanging out like twice a week, usually at the skatepark. Here's the weird thing, she only wants to hang out after 8 and that's the time my dad gets home from work at. She has a long fringe and always touches her face sorta hiding it, I thought it was a nervous thing, but now I don't know, maybe it's to stop me getting a good look because it's my dad. I'm beat up about the whole thing because I really like her, but I'm just not sure, something doesn't seem right.","#9691

I don't understand how people make friends and find people to date. I dated on person during high school and have a few mediocre friends from high school and haven't kept in touch with pretty much anyone from my first year. I've tried a few clubs, but most of the ones I'm interested in require a larger time investment plus I live off campus. I've tried tinder and have literally gotten zero matches besides bots. I've been working on my appearance and my hygiene and think I'm pretty average at this point, chubby but besides that normal. Yet I still have the social skills of a fucking potato. Does anyone else have a crushing amount of anxiety trying to meet new people? How do you get past it? Am I just ugly af?","#9612

Tomorrow is the last day of classes, and tonight I couldn’t help but look back and think about my first 8 months here at UBC. This has been such an odd experience. I never expected to do well or to even make it here academically. I very much expected to fail and to my delight and surprise so far I’ve actually made so much more progress here academically then I ever expected to. Despite the happiness I feel for what I’ve learned and the love that I have for the subject I get to study, I can’t help but feel like a massive failure. Before I came here I was very confident socially, but by 2 months into my first year all of my social skills were destroyed, as making friends here has been a huge struggle. I came from a very small town, where everyone knew everyone, and nothing ever changed. I feel that this along with my inability to adapt to how people interact here is part of the reason that I have no close friends. I feel so alienated socially, and it’s changed me so much. I can’t bring myself to go to social events, there’s just this constant nagging in my head telling me that no one wants me there, and that even if you did go, you’d be going alone so why even try. I do regular exercise and study constantly to take my mind away from it. Long runs and getting lost in my textbooks for hours have become the best escape from the dreadful reality that other people don’t want to be around you. I see people taking photos together and being happy all around me, and all I want is that. Just one friend who wants to go eat food with me, and that I can laugh with and be happy around. It seems like everyone here has a place to fit into, but for some reason I just can’t find mine. It breaks my heart, and I just hope that someday I can look back at this year as some sort of a phase.","#9579

A few days ago I was finishing my great 1 plate deadlifts (I'm pretty weak) and he approaches me to ask how many sets I had left. I tell him that I actually just finished and he says ""oh cool, don't worry about re-racking your weights, I'll take care of it"" and just casually cleans the bar with my plates on and moves it to the squat rack as if he was carrying an empty bar.

Dear my irresponsible group member,
Hi, how is it going? Actually, I don’t really care because you’re probably too busy partying to even respond – Just like in the project group chat! Anyways, here are some suggestions that I highly recommend you to follow in the future when you’re working in a group project:
1) Please don’t say that you’re okay with an idea and then change it at the very last minute. It’s very annoying, just like you.
2) Don’t use that “I didn’t see your message” bullcrap. Newsflash, Facebook messenger shows whether you have seen the chat or not. Lying is not a good look for you sweetie.
3) When you asked me to check your work at 3:00 AM in the morning, when the due date was literally within a few hours, I was close to crying. I may have a kink for vampires but that doesn’t mean I don’t like my sleep. Please ask ahead of time.
4) Be a decent human being. Don’t scroll through your Instagram feed when someone is speaking to you. Show some respect.
What I’m trying to say is… You disappointed me, so please don’t drag your future unfortunate partners down and create more victims due to your inconsiderate acts.
Sincerely,
A student who’s trying to help you out","#9544

When I was younger and my parents would leave to go grocery shopping, I would search for videos of boobs on YouTube (I'm a girl). Things like bouncing boobs and girls squeezing their giant jugs would make me feel... interesting things. I never really enjoyed full-on porn where any primary sexual organs were the focal point, I just really had a thing for boobs. But as I got older, I stopped searching for those kinds of videos because I didn't really get anything out of them anymore. Actually, I just tried watching one out of curiosity and felt really bored. Sometimes I ask myself, why was I so into this? I wasn't even interested in any girls irl, just into videos of huge jugs online lol","#9540

If you were the one who needed a group to join to do group quizzes with in the beginning of the semester for an online course, and we took you in, you should be nicer and not passive to us when we are discussing answers on the chat. Just because we all have a life and don't always go on Facebook and talk in the group chat like you, doesn't mean we don't give a fuck about our mark. Instead of thinking we're so last minute and lazy, maybe you should understand the fact that we have better things to do, people to hang out with, rather than waiting at a computer screen for one of us to reply. Would you be like that if we were actual groupmates in a classroom? We're obviously doing this quiz together so stop thinking you're the best and you carry us, when you need us to do the quiz. You were nice in the beginning but obviously your true colours showed. ""What was the answer to that question again?"" you tell us... ""I said 14b"".... like can you not say that in a nicer tone... it obviously seems really passive, especially for online.

I know I can treat girls better, I would honestly treat them like the way Kanyes does to Kim.
Anyways, I gave up looking for a girlfriend years ago and started focusing on my career. At the same time, I started seeing escorts, I needed another human's touch, I was depressed, I was lonely af. I was banging hot asian girls and white girls, who were at least a 7 to a 10. Sweet asian chicks you would see at the club dt vancouver, she go low mein. Over 3.5 years, I've seen about 35 different girls. I got to know some of them outside of their work, we would talk about life, goals, go to concerts, smoke weed, chill, etc. These girls are actually normal, regular people that you would never expect to be an escort, some of them might be even be your classmate. A couple of them are nursing students for example, they do it to pay tuition and rent. Who am I to judge.
Some people will probably say some shit like ""haha hope you get stds"".
Honestly, these girls are more safe than a random girl you would find at a bar. They get tested frequently and always play safe.
For all my dudes that can't find love. You can buy love. Remember, it's not how big you are, it's how big your bank account is.","#9470

I feel like this could get a lot of hate so tg it's anonymous.
This isn't specific even to this school, I want to say this to everyone in every post secondary institution who reads these: I'm SO TIRED of hearing you people complain. About anything and everything.
Very few of you at this school have endured true hardships. ""Oh my god..."" ""I have so many papers due..."" ""I have an exam tomorrow..."" ""it's so cold in here..."" ""it's too hot in here..."" ""I can't believe we have to do this...""
You have no idea how good you have it. There's always someone who's had it worse than you. There are going to be times when you're really uncomfortable cause either you haven't slept in a few days or it's cold as shit or you're baking in a hot room. Life fucking sucks. Most of you have no fucking clue how bad it can actually get.
I understand that people complain and I do it sometimes too but the the amount I hear every day exhausts me. It's incessant at this school. I know there are people who have it worse than I do. I do my best to keep in mind that I could be worse off in how my life is going. I just wish more of you would see it too and stop with the whining.","#9465

I am way too hard on myself. Here is a little bit about me. I am a 3rd year student who has the hope of getting into an extremely competitive graduate program after I finish my degree. To have a hope of getting into the school and program, I need to maintain an average in the high 80s. The stress and performance anxiety is killing me. Even when I get good grades (80%-85%) I am not happy with my performance because although those are great marks they are not good enough for my program. I've never gotten a mark in the 70's but if I did I would probably breakdown. Basically anything less than a 90% makes me extremely upset with myself. Nobody knows this of course because nobody wants to hear about the person who is upset with an 85%, but the pressure I am placing on myself to get these grades is so unhealthy. I don't really socialize much, I don't play sports anymore, I don't eat well... I basically study all day. I know I should get help and talk to someone about how to be less hard and demanding on myself. However, I am scared that if I get help I will do a lot worse in school because I won't be constantly anxious about doing well. Yeah idk I guess the first part of getting help is admitting you have a problem.
TL;DR I want to get into a graduate program. I need high grades. The stress is becoming unbearable.","#9455

Unreported sexual assault cases have always been a problem but it's not until you hear the stories of people around you that it really hits you, that it's happening at an extent far greater than imagined. Its assumed that since this isn't the states the problematic stuff about campus safety and fraternities is a lot less prevalent here but the problems still exist. It's heartbreaking to hear stories that survivors share of rape that happen anywhere especially on campus but when everyones got a story to share of something thats happened to someone involving rape on campus within the last few years, this isn't something that should be acceptable. I know that it takes incredible courage for survivors to report or speak out on their story and it's never something they should be forced into doing. I'm in no position to ask something of you if it makes you uncomfortable yet I urge you even if your voice shakes to to speak out, the coward who attacked you could be attacking others and if the possibility of the threat of the next attack could be reduced then isn't it worth it to share? It won't be easy. There's always possible backlash but isn't that with everything in life? They don't deserve to keep going here especially if seeing them around campus makes your life uneasy. I hope you can find the strength to speak out even if it's anonymously, but at the end of the day it's your choice. I think thats what troubles me is that I can't speak out for them, its not my story to share and that's why Im anonymous now. I can't file the report or do anything without getting the survivor involved. This is just a hearsay story but I wouldn't take it lightly, there has been an allegation that a member of the Beta Theta Pi frat raped a girl but she doesn't feel comfortable yet about reporting it. With their party coming up I can't help but feel a sense of worry. Obviously one guy doesn't define a frat but when it's not reported about what he has done then he'll never be held accountable for his actions. I'm only sharing this now here because I don't know what to do with the information told to me but I can't keep quiet, my apologies to the survivor of this story, I'm sorry if you feel I shouldn't have said anything but I can't just dismiss your story completely, i hope you can understand this.","#9439

Ever since I came to UBC, I feel like my morals have decayed exponentially. I was always the ""good kid"" in high school: no drugs, no drinking, no cheating, no shortcuts. I only studied, maintained a healthy lifestyle, and hung out with my equally-wholesome friends. Like, thank god I live at home right now, so i still feel the need to maintain a front for my parents. Otherwise, I cannot imagine what I would be doing. I plan to move out soon, which makes me so excited and so worried at the same time.
Currently, I regularly commit academic dishonesty by writing other people's papers for money and send assignment answers back and forth between my friends. This isn't even that bad, I guess, but it was only the beginning of my downfall. Last week, I considered taking drugs just to boost my studying. I was so close. So close. Then, I find myself considering various shady and unethical business ideas just for the sake of money. I'm not even that broke and I earn a steady income from my job, but I just want to hoard more money. I nearly signed up to be a sugar-baby too, even though I already have a loving boyfriend. Something about that easy money is so tempting. I place such a high value on money now, that sometimes I even disregard other people's needs and feelings.
I hate myself. I hate this disappointment that I feel toward my changing ideals and actions. I want to go back to the old me, but I keep thinking that I was naive and foolish for not recognizing the value of money. Also, I keep searching for shortcuts in life in lieu of hard work. It's only been two years of not-even-that-difficult studies! I'm fat, greedy, and lazy as fuck! What has happened to me???","#9427

What's wrong with SUS? I'll give you my answer, as a upper year science student, former science club exec, and someone who has tried to use Ladha. I've broken down the explanation into 3 E's - Execs, Election, and Events.
1. Their execs. Some of these guys are so childish it's amazing. They're all in Integrated Science for some reason, and they're so obnoxious in their building! They yell, stream games, roll around in the chairs, as if the building is a playground. I've even had some of these executives book over my club's room booking, and not bat an eye.They're also braindead - I remember watching a few of their current executives at a debate once. They couldn't formulate a single answer for any of the questions they were given. All they used were buzz words that they clearly could not understand, and stuttered like every other word. Big surprise, they still got elected.
2. Their elections. A point came up recently on UBCC about how one of the students running for a VP position still did not have their platform up. I 100% would've done the same - why have a platform up if you're basically uncontested! Furthermore, why communicate your vision, if the student body doesn't give a shit? I remember one of the SUS execs commenting on a post that ""our low voter turnout is ultimately not our fault"" or some BS like that, but it is. It's your duty to translate knowledge to science students, and encourage them to take action. There's a reason why SUS voter turnouts are way lower than other undergraduate societies. Find the reason and address it.
3. Their events. The events suck. I remember going to Science frosh as a first year and it was so terrible I still have bad memories. One of their recent events was ""Wheelchair basketball"" or something like that, and the reason was to empathize with people who need to use a wheelchair. Talk about conceited, using a wheelchair isn't fun for people who have to be in one.
I still don't know why these guys get funded, despite the overwhelming majority of science students who don't appreciate what they do. Just use the money to lessen my tuition, or something productive.","#9406
What's wrong with SUS? I'll give you my answer, as a upper year science student, former science club exec, and someone who has tried to use Ladha. I've broken down the explanation into 3 E's - Execs, Election, and Events.
1. Their execs. Some of these guys are so childish it's amazing. They're all in Integrated Science for some reason, and they're so obnoxious in their building! They yell, stream games, roll around in the chairs, as if the building is a playground. I've even had some of these executives book over my club's room booking, and not bat an eye.They're also braindead - I remember watching a few of their current executives at a debate once. They couldn't formulate a single answer for any of the questions they were given. All they used were buzz words that they clearly could not understand, and stuttered like every other word. Big surprise, they still got elected.

I'm starting to really hate social media and everything that is associated with it. I know it's become pretty ingrained in our lives(as I'm posting on social media Rn lol) but it's got to the point where social media is becoming the gold standard of one's character. For example I live off campus around nature and was walking my dog with my sister; her idea so I was expecting a nice walk just to chat. Nope the entire fucking time she is editing a post for fucking instagram not saying a word and it feels like I'm just walking by myself. I think it's becoming more important than actually living for some people, and I know I could just stay off of it, but all my peers are active etc. I'll be sitting with a group of friends and I'll be the only one who hasn't touched their phone once as I'm with people not needing to show it off to my other friends or something. It's ironic on people post about staying fucking present and by self promoting so much they are doing the complete opposite of being present. Fucking moronic","#9400

Being a moderate foot fetishist student at UBC is really difficult. I sometimes feel crushed by how hard it is to voice my honest opinions or suggestions on things. It's really a shame that I can't reasonably contribute ideas or thoughts without fear of being socially looked down upon. I always believed that the echo chamber mentality was exaggerated before I came here and didn't expect things to be like this, though I guess it's common at many universities. It's disappointing that I immediately get called out for being racist/xenophobic/homophobic for voicing my foot fetish despite the fact that I have many liberal beliefs such as pro diversity(I'm an immigrant of colour myself) and pro gay marriage. I've often been told that the left encourages unique personal identity and standing out from the crowd, but it's ironic how that often that no longer applies when your identity doesn't align with their beliefs.","#9360

Tl;dr If in class u tell me to shut up, then at least make me believe you're trying.
My EOSC class is considered a GPA booster, as one would expect. One day, a few of my friends accompanied me to class and we had some mini conversations. The prof's presentations have many slides and he races by them pretty quickly, but most of the slides just explain topographic maps and ask i-clicker questions (for participation) so the material isn't too overwhelming. He also posts his presentations online for our own usage. 40 min into the lecture, and all of the sudden, some boi called us out, saying to us, ""I'm trying to write down notes and you're pretty loud so if you're gonna continue to talk, I can show you to the door."" Since he was sitting in front of us we stared at his laptop monitor and he wrote a total of 2 lines. Unbelievable! 40 min into class AND the prof literally hands us his presentation so we can study at out own pace and this guy has the audacity to sass us. Either he was really struggling with this gpa booster class (which if he was, he should've dropped out by now) or this guy just has a poor work ethic. All in all, he should choose his words carefully, bcse if he says hes trying to write down notes, maybe he should ""try"" a little harder.","#9350

Sometimes I wish my boyfriend would stop treating his sister so nicely like a girlfriend relationship to because I am his girlfriend. It just seems unatural to me that a brother and a sister would have such deep personal relationships where they talk about their struggles and go out to dinner sometimes and how he buys gifts for his sister. Don't get me wrong, he treats me well too but sometimes he seems to think he has two girlfriends :(","#9315

People know me as one of the most outgoing, social, and generally charismatic people in my department. It's true that I'm outgoing and find it easy to talk to people, strangers, and generally relate to others.
What they don't observe is how left out I feel almost all the time. It's a department where people usually study and work in very close-knit groups, none of which I am a part of. I don't have a 'group' or 'circle' of people that I'm close with, make regular plans with, or closely associate with. Instead, I'm on just 'friendly terms' with pretty much everyone, but that doesn't translate into invitations to hang out, study together, or much at all really.
Next time you think of someone as super charismatic or outgoing, think for a second - are they really just trying extra hard to connect with people, because they feel left out? The answer will be 'yes' more often than you think.","#9307

Im frugal (but terrified to be referred to as stingy) my boyfriend is frivolous but what others refer to as generous. We live together and alternate weeks on who buys groceries (mine from no frills and his from whole foods).
Maybe I am super stingy, but he invites friends round three times a week for dinner and uses so much of our expensive food on friends who never invite us back. I say our friends, they're his friends who are nice enough, he encourages me to invite mine round but I just don't want to spend when its already so expensive.
Its so painful when I watch him open the expensive meat to serve to 4 of his friends that was meant to last me the whole week. When I use cheese I ration and only use a tiny bit to make the bag last at least a week, to watch his friends greedily ask for more cheese and the proceed to put the rest of the bag on their Spaghetti Bolognese makes my blood boil.
Im so worried if I bring it up he will see me as being selfish because he has always been so kind and generous to me. But my weekly bill for food has tripled since moving in with him and I can afford it but am also saving up, so don't want to spend it. He already spends far more than me on groceries because he shops in whole foods but these groceries don't stretch further. I've hinted to him and he laughs and shrugs it off. It's got to the point where I make smaller portions for myself with none left over to avoid him inviting round the neighbour to eat the surplus with us.
I don't want to alienate him from his friends or stop his lifestyle because he has always had friends over for dinner. What do I do?","#9261

Okay. So here's my first confession and it's about VANIER'S shit PRINTER. We're paying THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of dollars in tuition yet we don't have access to BASIC PRINTING SERVICES in VANIER! Can I go to the Asian Library right now? No, one its a fucking 10 minute walk from here, and two, it's fucking closed after five. Marine Drive? They don't have printers. Ponderosa? They have TWO DOORS leading to their printing room, both of which require a special access key we Vanier noobs are not given.
Now, one would assume considering the FRONT DESK STAFF are asked when the printer will be fixed every single fucking day, AND the printer is broken/out-of-order 99% of the time, those combined would be sufficient reason to at LEAST have TWO PRINTERS so when one printer inevitably breaks down all of Vanier isn't stranded for printing / forced to ask everyone in their entire house to borrow a printer. UBC, you're rich--and WE ARE PAYING FOR PRINTING! Give us access to a service LITERALLY EVERY UNIVERSITY HAS. and WTAF are the ""Residence Life"" staff working on all day if us Vanier kids are stressed out all the time for the littlest of shit like this.
One day I had to print an assignment in the morning to hand in before my midterm in Buchanan and I gave myself an ample 10 extra minutes to do so and GUESS WHAT? The DAMN PRINTER WAS OUT OF ORDER. WHAT A FUCKING SURPRISE. and since I didn't know where the printer was in Buchanan I had to explain this to my prof before the midterm, who looked amazed as if I was making up a story that couldn't exist at a university like UBC.

I hope all of you are well and happy and, I'm sorry for the long post . Because of various circumstances, situations and who I am as a person, I've been lonely most of my life. If it wasn't for the support of my loving family , I would've probably lost hope in life because of the pain loneliness causes . It's almost physical sometimes.

I hope all of you are well and happy and, I'm sorry for the long post . Because of various circumstances, situations and who I am as a person, I've been lonely most of my life. If it wasn't for the support of my loving family , I would've probably lost hope in life because of the pain loneliness causes . It's almost physical sometimes.

Covered head to toe in my black north face jacket - which you always wore - shivering from the cold, I stood in front of the UBC water fountain as we locked eyes from across the half frozen water. The moment we met in an embrace, I felt warmth as your arms wrapped around my waist. Naturally, heat transfer through thick clothes doesn't work in an instant; it was my heart that gave me the warmth I am learning to forget. And it was my heart that only you know how to complete. Though this was months ago, and as spring comes around, the sun might finally provide me the warmth you used to give. Thank you for the memories as we're now moving along. But I will keep that jacket safe in case of the day you might wear it once more.","#9208

My friends fucking suck. Every year they plan absolutely nothing for my birthday and then barely acknowledge it. Even when I try to organize something the week of or after my birthday they say they have midterms or work yet they are constantly snapping or posting pictures of them with their boyfriends, other friends, or family dining or hanging out. I've had some of these friends for over a decade and I do love them but honestly I'm sick of this bullshit. I'm always doing my best to support them and going OUT OF MY WAY to make them happy even when it's detrimental to my own happiness yet they hardly ever show any appreciation. I'm over being sentimental about my relationship with them because being under-appreciated and used repeatedly is infuriating. Even though I don't have many other friends, fuck them.","#9206

Hey everyone, graduating dent student here. Please please please please please please brush your teeth at least twice a day (morning/night). I know it can be hard sometimes if you are super tired at night or in a rush in the morning, but so many of the patients I see need dental work done because they don't do the basic teeth cleaning everyday. If you brush your teeth it seriously helps prevent or at least lessen the chance of cavities. and PLEASE get your teeth cleaned at least once a year (twice if you can afford it). Otherwise plaque builds up and just makes cavities more likely as well.","#9156

I’m so infatuated with my friend. One day she was just one of my buddies and the next day something just clicked and I fell for her nose first. I know I put her on a pedestal and it’s wrong and she would never see me this way but my heart skips a beat when I see her name pop up on my screen.
Even worse, I have a great girlfriend who’s supportive, funny, and cute. So I’ve been trying to avoid my friend in hopes that feelings will pass.","#9125

Fuck you UBC confessions admins! Just because you disagree with my views you decide to not post my confession. You're all just a bunch of immature good for nothings who go on a power trip because you run this page. I just hope someone starts a page where all confessions are posted without censorship. Let the readers decide what they want to read or not. If they don't like a confessions they can just scroll down to another one -- that's what Canada is all about, but you shitheads wouldn't know since you grew up with censorship and don't have a clue about freedom of thought and expression.
That'll make my day when someone starts a no-censorship confessions page and you people can go fuck off somewhere where your censorship is welcome!
I'm 100% sure you dumb fucks running this shit hole of a page are either Chinese or Indian. Prove me wrong if this is not the case! Just because you grew up with censorship and were brainwashed since childhood that it's OK to muzzle opposing views, you think it's fine to pull that off here!.

Welcome to CPEN 211, where you sell your soul to the prof (Tornado). Have fun spending 10-20 hours every week on labs. Make sure not to say a single word about the lab near anyone taking the course (other than your lab partner) or you'll get kicked out of UBC (Tor tries his best to see that it actually happens). Best of luck trying to draw impossibly complex waveforms of logic diagrams which I am pretty sure even the prof won't be able to do under exam conditions. Also, make sure you are able to code up a week's worth of project within 2 hours during the programming proficiency test, which by the way is marked by an autograder, which will give you a fat 0 if you make even a single tiny mistake. The prof doesnt give a shit if your state machine works perfectly fine, if you missed a default statement, you will get 6% cut off your final grade. Oh, you named your file q.v instead of q1.v? How dare you? You deserve to fail the course.","#9112

The amount of ignorance some people have astounds me sometimes. To the recent post in the group UBC class of 2021, maybe consider the fact that not everyone is actually able to afford tuition. Student loans are a thing! Ever hear of those? Scholarships, grants, bursaries, all things many students heavily rely on to pay for tuition and living expenses. Don't be fooled by all the fancy canada goose jackets you see and flashy designer clothes, that only represents a part of the population. Is it so difficult for the rest of the community to come together and help those who may not have the money to spend on transit at its full price on a daily basis? Also consider why the student may be living off campus. Chances are, its because its too expensive to live on campus, so they choose to live off campus even though it takes up a lot of time in their day. Or perhaps the student can afford to pay tuition, but only a certain number of courses a term and tell their friends its just because they don't want too heavy a courseload. Whatever the circumstance, its not like people choose to commute simply because of they want to take advantage of the u-pass you so desperately don't want to pay for. There are always other problems and difficulties involved, even for those who do live on res (they need to get around too and cars are expensive!). So please, before you choose to not support the u-pass, think about your community and what you contribute to support everyone. Everyone has their differences, but we should help one another nonetheless in a positive manner.
P.S. opting out is a thing.","#9103

Sooooo part 2 of tragic stories involving food on the floor at the library.
Its the first day back to school after reading break and I get railed by my psych midterm. Im talking I wrote in my answers ""I emailed you for help on this question and you still didn't help me so sorry I don't know this"". Anyways, the only light at the end of this dark day was this homemade soup my mom packed me. I have another midterm on Wednesday as well so since I knew id be going ham at the library tonight I brought a nice big cooler wish fresh zesty orange slices, some energy drinks, and of course my moms homemade soup. I'm sitting in the basement of Koerner library and my stomach starts grumbling like a mother fuckerr. BUT I know I have my carefully crafted and made with love soup to look forward to. I lean down, zip open my perfectly packed cooler and to my demise...I witness a soup explosion. I shrieked in pain FUCKKK not the soup. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I know understood I am not only failing at university, but I am now soupless. The worst part of it all is somehow a mini heart shaped cutout from valentines day somehow ended up in my cooler so amidst this soupey mess is a heart shape just floating around, really embodying how heartbroken I was.","#9100

Sorry, but if you’re someone who breaks up with someone you’ve been dating by ghosting them, you’re honestly just garbage and I have zero respect for you.
Don’t let the other person you were once romantically involved with wonder what they did so wrong that they didn’t even deserve an explanation. I get it if it’s a one night stand or something- but if you’ve been dating for awhile?! Come ON.
MULTIPLE friends of mine (not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, but FIVE) have dated someone for some span of 4 weeks to 6 months and been “broken up” with this way. It’s so cold and cowardly. Grow up and at least make up a lie about how you’re not emotionally available or something. Consider other people’s feelings- I don’t care how uninterested or how lazy you are lol. I’m tired of seeing my amazing friends cry over you pieces of trash for weeks. How are they supposed to move on if they don’t even know what happened?

A quick shout-out to the Wellness Centre and Student Services staff! The WC in particular gets a lot of hate, but I was going through some tough crap and I finally went in to see them (non-urgently) and was set up with a meeting two hours later. My wellness advisor was super nice and understanding, and the group therapy session I attended was really chill and had a lot of useful information provided to me. (I recognize some of the issues the WC may have if they're throwing people with more serious issues into group, but in my experience its been really helpful! The WC doesn't have the resources/staff for everyone to get free one-on-one therapy unfortunately) When I went to see my faculty's SS, I was set up with a meeting immediately and was belt to talk to a very kind staff member who helped me answer all my questions and figure out how I should move forward.
All the problems I have aren't fixed, and I'm certainly still just as stressed about upcoming exams, but the whole of my life doesn't seem to be crashing down around me anymore. If you talk to me tomorrow or in a few days, I might have a different opinion, but as of now things are looking up! I just wanted to let anyone reading this know that if you're struggling, there are tons of amazing resources out there, all you need to do is go ask for help! There are people here who's sole job is to help you become better to yourself and figure out a life plan :)","#9087

I hate when people antagonize smokers. Yes, I agree, smoking is a bad habit which I personally hope no one picks up. I also agree that when friends and loved ones offer advice regarding quitting smoking, it should be graciously accepted. What I am against however is the belief that some people have the belief that smokers are by nature, bad, ignorant people, and that their systematic antagonization is the only way to eradicate this habit of theirs.
The belief that smokers are unaware of the harm that smoking causes to their body and minds, as well the belief that smokers have no regard for others is completely untrue. As with other groups, smokers cannot be generalized, they must instead be dealt with as unique individuals, and must be given the same respect that every other person is given.
I truly believe that in order to grow in life, one must first make mistakes. These mistakes take many forms but at the end of the day, they are the most educational experience, without the ridiculous tuitions attached to them. Smoking lies in the same category. It is a mistake that teaches an individual more than what meets the eyes. It has made me recognize self-control, and that my mind is more powerful than my addictive urges. At the end of the day, antagonizing a smoker does nothing more than promotes their behaviour, as it separates the human bond that they share with others. The only way to properly and permanently put a stop to this habit is if it comes from within. When one learns from his own experiences instead of being screamed at by society, they are able to see its true value. Although such a path is obstacle ridden, and is often acquired too late into one’s life, it becomes a defining moment which remains with the individual.
So to wrap up, next time you see a smoker, don’t direct derogatory remarks to them, instead take a step back and see them as a person who, although is a smoker, shares the same natural tendency to make mistakes that you do. Only then can you offer genuine, heartfelt advice. At the end of the day, you win or you learn and to learn you must lose first.","#9071

It is a mistake that teaches an individual more than what meets the eyes. It has made me recognize self-control, and that my mind is more powerful than my addictive urges. At the end of the day, antagonizing a smoker does nothing more than promotes their behaviour, as it separates the human bond that they share with others. The only way to properly and permanently put a stop to this habit is if it comes from within. When one learns from his own experiences instead of being screamed at by society, they are able to see its true value. Although such a path is obstacle ridden, and is often acquired too late into one’s life, it becomes a defining moment which remains with the individual.
So to wrap up, next time you see a smoker, don’t direct derogatory remarks to them, instead take a step back and see them as a person who, although is a smoker, shares the same natural tendency to make mistakes that you do. Only then can you offer genuine, heartfelt advice. At the end of the day, you win or you learn and to learn you must lose first.",,1520398800,,,32,29,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1823983087619976&id=1287650764586547,

I have a friend who’s this super cute and super sweet girl. I’ve always wanted to ask her out, and most of my friends think I should, but I’m actually afraid that she’d say yes. Don’t get me wrong: we get along pretty well as friends, and I think she has a great personality, but she’s rich and I’m not. I guess it’s just the way she was raised up, but the money she spends in a week is equivalent to what I’d spend in over a month. So if she theoretically agreed to start dating, I really don’t know how it would work out. Help me, I’m torn between this choice. :(","#9070

I find it endlessly confusing when people who are clearly UBC students wear apparel from another university. Just a quick question... are you lost? did you momentarily forget you were in Vancouver, BC when you woke up this morning and put on your USC cap or Western university sweater? This is definitely an extremely petty and minor thing to complain about, but it still bothers the heck out of me. I find it especially frustrating when I see students in first year classes doing it. I can somewhat wrap my head around the idea of an older student having gone to another university and then attending UBC afterwards, but a first year student? when did you have time to study at the university of waterloo before starting your bachelors at UBC????
TL;DR Please stop wearing the apparel of other universities while on campus, you are confusing and frustrating the simple-minded population of UBC (myself included)","#9038

Girls on tinder are all really picky and rude let's be real here.
I literally try to not sound like a douche or fuck boy so I just start convos with an ""Hey"" or ""What's up"" something simple to create a conversation. They always reply with an ""Hey!:) What's up"" or ""Hey!:) Not too bad hbu"" and THAN BOOM, the conversation dies and they never reply after that...
Like BRUH, give me a fucking chance to at least get to know you.
BUT you know what? There are categories of tinder girls:
-Category 1: UBC girls. As a guy who goes to UBC, I would expect to match with UBC girls and have some things in common or just have a conversation. LMAO, NOPE, that's not happening. It's impossible to have a conversation with them and I just don't get it. Why would someone swipe right and try not to have a conversation? And if you did it by accident just unmatch...
-Category 2: Other unis and colleges around Van. They're all alright and at least try their best to have a conversation and get to know you.
-Category 3: Girls who live in the middle of nowhere or in the islands. OH MY GOSH. They're all like perfect. Easy going, nice, beautiful, smart. Just like the perfect combo ya know?
You know what, I know, I'm on tinder for the wrong thing. I'm not there just to have sex... But honestly, It's rare to meet someone in person now days and tinder is the only app EVERYONE goes on.
Anyways, this is to all the UBC girls. Please give a chance to all the average looking guys with a pure heart.

The COMM 394 (Government and Business) midterm was supposed to be last Thursday the 8th, as it had been scheduled since the the beginning of the semester. It is now tomorrow (Chinese New Years, February 15). Why?
Because the co-chairs of some ""Imprint"" decided that having an exam on the day of their silly little student conference wasn't going to work, cried about it to the COMM 394 course coordinator, who didn't have the forethought or balls to say ""no, we can't reschedule an exam for a stupid student conference"".

To anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of using a male urinal/bathroom at UBC let me enlighten you a little bit:
UBC is, apparently, home to a seemingly huge number of rude, poorly raised and honestly disgusting guys. There have been a fair share of posts on the state of the bathrooms but what shocks me the most is that while I was in the bathroom 5+ guys left without flushing (including a guy using an already unflushed stall and not flushing it either!!). Am I the only one who finds this gross? I'm not even talking about the smell but the act alone shows a lack of respect which I am sad to find here.
Now I know that many urinals at UBC are automatic but honestly if an average SFU student can tell the difference in a second i'd hope you'd be able to as well...plus what else are you gonna do while you take a piss? Do you just leave Earth for a few seconds? No? Then just look at the god damn urinal and...Oh what's that? The flush! Now, you get to flex your finger muscles and press on a button. Not only are you one step closer to that bikini body but you're also making sure your piss doesn't ferment for my pleasure and delight.
I'm getting tired of having to flush after spoiled assholes.
TLDR: If you don't flush after you use the bathroom I will personally hunt you down and drown you in your own pus.","#8927

That girl in that lecture, whom I would enjoy her smile just as I enter a room and our cherished conversation that quite never go anywhere. That local student, who welcomes you to UBC without hesitance but never form that sort of relationship where you would hangout with them outside of class.

Hong Kong students have constituted a significant proportion of the UBC population. HKSA is overwhelmingly the first student club that Hong Kong students likely approach when they enter UBC, as the club markets itself as one that promotes HK initiatives.
Yet, as a new UBC student from Hong Kong, I am startled by the fact that UBC HKSA is indeed, not formed by students from Hong Kong. Their members and execs are evidently students with HK background (e.g. their parents are from HK), but rarely do they have any genuine living experience in the city. In other words, many of them were not raised and born in HK. Accordingly, they reportedly refuse to speak in Cantonese, which is the official mother tongue of HK people.
I would very much like to state that MOST of their events have nothing to do with promoting HK culture and gathering local HK students. Here is a list of events that UBC HKSA have held in the past and present:
1. Sugar High
2. Nightclass
3. Dessert Date Night
4. Casino night
5. Basketball and Dodgeball tournaments
I could not stress enough HOW MUCH I would like to meet people who share the same background and speak the same language as I do in such a diverse university. I believed that these individuals could assist me in my well-being and/or provide me with opportunities and connections for my future careers after I graduate from UBC and return to my hometown. Unfortunately, HKSA has rarely tried to provide HK students with these opportunities.
How could HKSA occupy the name ""HK"" if they provide no support to HK students? How is it able to REPRESENT HK students on campus? Simply having a picture of HK on their posters does not sound convincing to me that UBC HKSA is a representation of myself. As an HK student who was born and raised in HK, I can assure you that HKSA never provides any assistance to me and my HK friends.
Being diverse is a good aim, and we should all work on this as UBC students. Nevertheless, UBC HKSA destroyed the original intention and meaning of forming this club.

This “Night at the Mansion” themed party is a part of the bigger problem, and this Playboy theme has nothing to do with sexual liberation. As a woman who was sexually assaulted and harassed multiple times before, it is emotionally breaking for me to see that especially during the days when the entire western world is talking about the “#me too” movement, another theme for a party, out of thousands of options, could not be chosen. I feel utterly ashamed that people, whom I share a community with, thought that this was a good idea. From a personal point of view, this idea, was pretty insensitive and humiliating, at best. Please, for a second, just drop your brotherhood, drop your volunteering, drop everything, and try to see what you are doing. It is those seemingly trivial actions and behaviors that perpetuate this problem. I am by no means trying to attack a certain Fraternity, not at all, I, in fact, have some very good friends who are all part of Fraternities. I am by no means trying to accuse anyone of anything, I am aware that many people who are part of this or any other fraternity are all intelligent and respectful men, yet, I am not trying to deal with persons and individuals, it is the idea that feels inappropriate to me. I am asking one last time, out of many plausible themes for a party, why this? Hugh Hefner, dead or alive, is not the one to be preached right now. Take your double standards and your so-called sexual liberation and think. This must mean, to any morally stable human being, more than being able to see some drunk women in bunny costumes. I then, invite the people who are part of this fraternity to comment on this post to tell me whom I can contact with for a possible theme change for this party. Please, do not take this post lightly, it breaks my heart that I even needed to post this in the first place.","#8855

I'd love to be able to stroll into class 15 minutes late with a nice hot coffee and a open saved seat for me.

I often see confessions complaining about UBC, everyone has their own experiences here and mine has been nothing short of life saving. I hated high school, I was bullied, teased and lost all of my self confidence because of it. My town was small and full of nothing but racists and homophobes and I hated every miserable moment I was there, I was so depressed I had contemplated suicide more times than I can count. So when I graduated from high school early moved to this campus at 17, and I never looked back, literally I made a point to not move off campus. I made an amazing friend group in first year rez, all of whom I'm still exceptionally close with two years later, and my social circle has done nothing but grow through clubs, organizations, and other extracurricular's. This campus is so beautiful and amazing and full of life and excitement and getting to be a part of that is amazing, UBC's events and campus life are so vibrant have given me every bit of happiness and love I could have ever asked for. I'm not saying this to brag, I just want to say that this university saved my life, and I love every second i am here :)","#8787

My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship, and I’m honestly feeling kind of defeated right now. I try to arrange phone calls/FaceTime dates, I text him all throughout the day, I send him funny videos that remind him of us, but I barely get any sort of interest returned. I know he’s busy with his job, so I wouldn’t expect him to text me while he’s at work, but he’s not working all day. We barely talk in the evening, and when we do it’s not for long “because he’s tired”. Is there anyway to not feel forgotten? I’ve been keeping myself SO busy, with classes and other activities to pass the time, but it’s the inbetween time when you look forward to a text that says “I’m thinking of you” or “I miss you” that really gets me down. I’m the one who always has to say “I can’t wait to come see you” or “the next time we’re together we should do this”. I know it’s not right, but I love him and I look forward to when he will come home. But right now I’m hurting because everything I’ve feared would happen, is happening.","#8775

Is it me or do the UBC Sustainability movements seem rather hypocritical? We're told be more responsible for our actions by turning off lights and heaters when they're not being used but why are these pointless TVs in Orchard Commons and the AMS nest always on? And what is the point of keeping separate bins for different types of garbage if there aren't enough of them and people end up tossing things in the wrong bins because the others have filled up? It's not easy to change everyone's lifestyle but there would be a higher chance of achieving this if the bins are more accessible.
I'm not sure if all of this is just a façade by the University to show that they are """"eco-friendly"""" or if they are genuinely trying and just being unsuccessful.","#8767

A little rant about Abdul Ladha:
I’d like to start this off by saying I truly love Abdul Ladha. Its floor to ceiling windows, numerous couches, central location, and microwaves make it the ideal building for any activity. HOWEVER, if I get kicked out one more time due to some “event”, I think I’ll have to find a new favourite place. It seems like everytime I’m just getting comfy, or finally down to work I am asked to leave. It would be understandable if there was one or two events a week, later in the evening, but it seems as if there is one everday now and sometimes right in the middle of the afternoon!! As a science student, I feel it is my right to have access to my student space for the majority of the day!!
TLDR: If I’m kicked out of abdul ladha for an exclusive, specific event one more time I’m going to lose it

OK, so I know there are a lot of posts on here about bad profs, but my prof for MATH 261 is actually abusive. He singled out one of the few girls in the class (I'm in civil engineering), and put her homework under the magnifying camera and marked in front of the entire class. She stood there sobbing while fifty people watched her get thirty percent on an assignment worth ten percent of our final grade. I am really struggling with the course, we are learning single variable partial derivatives, but I am terrified to ask the guy for help and I am starting to think I could fail the course. I am out of options and I need advice!!

Dear UBC Confessions,
It has been a strange week.
Reasons why:
1. I mistakenly recycled a pen in ""Paper"" instead of ""Plastics.""
2. I was in the washroom washing my hands after doing my business, when I glanced in the mirror and saw urinals. With surprise I thought ""Oh! UBC has a co-ed washroom?"" Then a guy walked into the washroom and our eyes met in the mirror for a split second and in that second I knew: I was in the men's washroom. I glanced at myself in the mirror hoping that perhaps I could pass for a guy but nope, I definitely look like a girl. I glanced at the guy, who was smiling but not looking at me. I furiously finished washing my hands and almost ran into a guy coming in on my way out. To the men using the urinals: I did not see anything I swear.
Now I am safely at home where there is one bathroom and I can easily correct my recycling errors.","#8734

I honestly struggle with giving out anything lower than a B+. I don't know. Maybe I am just a nicer person than many other TAs that can just dish out low grades or it is because I am undergrad student that is going through the same struggles as my students and I empathize with them better knowing that if I received a bad grade I would be pretty unhappy too. I also feel bad for screwing up their future if they miss out on something for a bad grade. I give honest feedback on ways to improve and I am honest with them that they need to really start working harder and know the material better but I am just always really conflicted whenever I enter in anything below a 80. It doesn't help when there is like no age-gap that it feels more like I am a friend-friend relation than a teacher-student relation.","#8731

Again no problem with this but then he starts to chew with his MOTHER FUCKING MOUTH OPEN AND MAKE THOSE WEIRD FUCKING NOISES I CANT REALLY DESCRIBE BUT ITS ANNOYING AS FUCK. The lecture hall had an echo and this bitch continues doing this for about 15 mins...I was so pissed off and annoyed as I was reading and hearing this sound behind me and it was making me feel to punch him so hard in the fucking noggin. God damn that sound just makes me really uncomfortable in ways I can’t handle. End rant.
No I wasn’t going to put on headphones and read because I can’t focus like that. I was not going to leave the hall and come back when it was time for class to start. I know I could have turned around and kindly say close your fucking mouth when chewing but I was so angry I just sat there and waited patiently. And yes I realize this makes me an ass for not doing or moving or whatever but for fucks sake learn fucking etiquette.

I'm sort of just writing this on a whim (mainly for the sake of procrastinating on homework... lol), but after all these years, I feel quite ""connected"" to UBC thanks to this confessions page even though I don't attend UBC. Reading all the confessions posted here really gets me through my day-to-day life in college. I guess the struggles of being a college student is pretty universal. It's nice to know that you're not alone. Anyhow, have a nice day fellow UBC students! You got this! And for those of you who think you don't, fake it till you make it!

I've heard a lot of good things about SUS (Science Undergrad Society), and as one of the larger faculties at UBC, I figured that joining SUS would be the most community feel I'd get within science. But after spending some time as a member I've never felt more left out. the sus community/exec team is extremely friendly but they all seem to be bffs and like theyve known each other forever, so if im ever near them it's like they don't even see me or acknowledge me. no matter how hard i try to involve myself or talk to people i feel like they'll talk to me because they're nice, but i'll never be ""in."" never invited to the events, if im ever at alssc they'll all group together and not say hi or invite me to join, its like this exclusive clique and if you're not in, you'll never be in. i was looking forward to really getting to know people but even if i have a great time talking to someone or hanging out with someone who's ""in"", the next time i see them it's just a nod of acknowledgement, not even conversation. TLDR; i think sus is great, the community is cute and they really work hard. the members are great people. I just wish they were more open, because its ironic how i joined sus to feel more in a community but the opposite is what happened. I thought it was just me feeling this way, and i figured its cause im a first year maybe but a lot of current and past members also felt this way.","#8719

So, as many single people do in first year, I've been hooking up with a bunch of people. And after getting out of a long-term relationship, I've been having so much fun so far. Half of me is enjoying the single life and how it's kinda carefree and the other half really wants a relationship again. Being in a committed relationship is what I want in the long term but a part of me also wants to continue being with whoever I want and not have to care too much about feelings and commitment. Does that just mean I'm not in the state of mind or maturity to be in another committed relationship?","#8700

This is going to make sound like a complete psycho but I think I have lost my ability to sympathize with people. Like I have a constant nagging feeling that my reality is different from everyone else, and everyone is just a mere figment of my imagination.Such feelings still shock when I have them but they always creep into my mind and unfortunately I don't think I can ever open up to a counsellor or something. Like I also feel like I don't belong in this world, there are many things I just can't seem to understand, adult stuff and things and I am scared of what is going to happen to me after graduation. I have always been a high achieving person my whole life and my current gap reflects that but I don't have a drive, no aspirations, no dreams.

I'm a guy at ubc in an abusive relationship with a girl in my year. In the beginning I thought she was such a kind person until we had our first argument. Now every time we have a disagreement or I say something she doesn't like it immediately becomes a physical beatdown from her. In the beginning she would just use kicks and punches to the face but recently it's escalated to her using objects. Most recently she slammed a mug on my hand that fractured three fingers. She's a trained martial artist and would wipe the floor with me even if I tried to defend myself. I've tried opening up about the abuse to others but almost everyone just brushes it off as no big deal or doesn't believe that a woman could do that much damage to me. The worst part is after every beat down she continuously apologizes to me and turns the situation to make it my fault and sucks me back in every time through guilt. I don't know what to do anymore. I need advice. Please help me. No one takes male victims of abuse seriously.","#8659

I was staring out of my window in Marine Drive (I live in one of the high rises) and saw what was arguably the most enthusiastic ironing of clothes ever. This guy had Sabaton, a Swedish Metal Band which happens to be a favourite of mine as well, on (had connected his computer to a screen so I was able to see). It was amazing to see him with his quick motions as he ironed his shirts and moved to the rhythm; he was clearly lost in the song.
So to the guy who's living room windows have ""Tris"" in stickies on them: Please do so again and if you happen to be at the Sabaton concert in February, I will definitely recognize through your bizarre yet amazing moves.","#8623

I broke up with my girlfriend about a year ago because we fell into, what I felt on my end, to be a mundane routine. I wanted to do switch it up and be spontaneous but she found comfort in the consistency. Ultimately, I couldn't stand being constant and she couldn't step outside of her zone.
Fast forward to this term and I've been feeling super lonely. I miss having someone to be with. My friends think I'm just hung up on my ex but that isn't it at all. I don't miss the person -I miss the feeling. There's something about feeling wanted in an intimate and close way that cannot be offset by other kinds of bonds and relationships.

What does it mean to be average? After 3 terms and 45 credits in UBC, my grades seem to average out to be only slightly higher than the class averages. My grades even out to a 75.8% whereas the class means even out to a 72.8%. Albeit, I have two more grades yet to be shown which I’m confident will boost my GPA, and I was extremely lazy last term which brought my average down significantly, this is where I stand. So on one hand, I know that there are people in my class who are getting 85, 90, or even higher; meanwhile, I’ve also heard people say “63%? I’m okay with that.” And I’m just really confused on how I should feel about my grades right now. Are they good enough to get a degree or am I stuck in a rift where my grades are just below the target?

At the last 15 minutes mark of the exam, it went off (Thanks @distant relative texting to ask if I were going to France next year). It was the best timing ever, hands down. Prof's mic made that WHRRRRRRNNGGGGG sound as he started to say the ""there are 15 minutes left, if you finish please stay seated blah blah blah"", just as my phone let out a big ""DING"".

You know when you go to a party, you’re in a room full of people but you’re not actually talking to anyone so you just feel awkward and really lonely? That’s how I’ve been feeling this whole semester. There’s a tight-knit club on campus that is really welcoming and warm and friendly. Everyone is really nice and we all get along, but I can’t help but feel like I’m on the outside always looking in. (I know that they’d laugh and sing at that reference, but it’s really the way I feel). Everyone in the club is friends with each other, but it’s obvious that there are groups and cliques. I just don’t seem to fit into any of the groups. I get invited to club-wide social events, so it’s not like I’m left out. I’m not. I just wish I got along REALLY well with at least SOME people in the club, instead of being stuck at that stage where I get along with everyone just fine.

Loneliness. Crippling, dreaded loneliness.
I've been talking on a daily basis with this girl for the past few months, and she's quite frankly, amazing. She calls our hangouts ""dates"", cuddles on me, and holds onto my arm. She invites me out to do things like skate, just the two of us. She flirts, she teases, she hints. Just like any other male with half a brain, I assumed she was into me. I expressed my seemingly mutual feelings, but they failed to be reciprocated. Apparently she was just ""being friendly"". Really? So I tried to find out how she was perceived by others, and realized that I am not the only one she treats this way. I am not any ""special guy"" to her, but rather, one of many. To me, this doesn't take away from the personality I have fallen for, but yet, fills me with a gnawing, constant sense of dread. Anything I do is futile. Anything I do is perceived and treated lightly. Anything I do isn't enough.
I can't tell someone how to live their life. I can't tell someone what is right, or what is wrong. I guess I'm just back to those nights filled with sadness. I know that one girl shouldn't determine if I'm happy or not, and I also know that there are other girls. But I guess I just got too emotionally invested, for reasons that I could go more in-depth to, but fail to have the sufficient will to do so. My bad, right? I guess it's back to the drawing board.

Okay, here me out. I'm an in engineering and quite frankly dislike majority of first year engineers. A lot of them are cocky and think they're the smartest person in the room even in an engineering classroom. Nevertheless, I genuinely believe my degree is more useful than many undergraduate degrees. No, that doesn't mean I think people in arts are dumb or that sciences is useless- not at all. It's that engineering is a four year PROFESSIONAL degree where I can get a JOB after. Something that most other degrees can't say.
No, I don't think that devalues any other degree- there's a reason why engineers have arts electives and first year English, but when people go hating on engineering students for thinking their degree is more valuable than others, well, hate to break it to you, it's because it is.
There are few tasks that you do on a daily basis that would be possible without the work of an engineer. Yes, without the work of someone who only has an undergraduate degree.
So next time you go on hating, remember: for most faculties, to be in the position of an engineering student earning a professional degree, you'd be in grad school. There's a reason our 4-5 (sometimes 6) years suck, but it's true.
TLDR: engineering degrees get jobs, so please stop hating on us for believing our degree is more valuable. It's because it is.","#8447

I hate how so many of the engineering students go around thinking that they're the elite students and everyone wants to be them. Newsflash: not everyone wants to be an engineer. Not being in engineering doesn't automatically mean that we're below you. All the faculties in some way are there for a reason (yes, even arts), and not every science kid wants to be you. Even some of the arts students are not an arts student just because they want to transfer, but because they genuinely wanted to be in that faculty. I get it, everyone gets it, you have a fairly heavy courseload. Every faculty has their unique challenges. Doesn't mean you should shut yourself off from people out of your faculty just because of it. Is it because they can't complain with you about that new assignment you got before you even finished the last one? Oh boohoo, go manage your time better. Yes, even your ethics things are important. They wouldn't take time talking about it if it weren't. Now get off that pedestal, you're just like the rest of us: struggling and exhausted university students clawing towards their degree.","#8416

As a first year engineer, I have to admit that the course load is actually manageable. If you can prioritize and have decent time management, you'll be fine.
The problem is, majority of first year eng students never had to study in high school and still got 100% on everything. They were the like 3 smartest kids in each school who barely paid attention, never did anything that wasn't graded and aced all their tests and exams. So the concept of ""doing work"" is completely new.
There is more work than the majority of other programs, but nothing that requires you to be up until 3 am drinking coffee every night. Especially in first year.

This is to the guy who sat next to me in Irving 4th floor today (Nov 23). You were literally my hero. It was weirdly crowded today and the only few spots left were at one of the high tables in the hall close to the washroom. What started out as a normal last minute paper cram turned into a disaster. I was not feeling well and my stomach was in pain. When I finally couldnt take it anymore and got up to go to the washroom, I noticed the ugly pool of my period all over the chair.

This is to the guy who sat next to me in Irving 4th floor today (Nov 23). You were literally my hero. It was weirdly crowded today and the only few spots left were at one of the high tables in the hall close to the washroom. What started out as a normal last minute paper cram turned into a disaster. I was not feeling well and my stomach was in pain. When I finally couldnt take it anymore and got up to go to the washroom, I noticed the ugly pool of my period all over the chair. I was embarrassed and didn't want to leave my seat but also could not sit in agony any longer.

Dear students of University of Bitching Crybabies,
Aw come on you're failing your midterms because you went out eating and partying with Daddy and Mommy's 4-figure pocket money? Or perhaps you're too worried about smashing more girls than your average grade? It's honestly amusing to see students posting their wild drinking stories the week before midterms and come out crying about failing.
And if you're the type to be checking your Facebook feed on your obnoxiously large laptop screen, brought to you by parents' money and your demands, then don't try to be copying notes off of the students that are actually trying. For the record, a linear relationship CAN be established between those who actually focus in class and do their homework over the ones too bothered to check up on their social media. Even if you do succeed from leeching off of others (good luck with that, I've yet to see anyone do so), you're just a burden on your classmates and possibly in society.
For the record, university isn't going to be easy, yeah that's common sense. But slapping on your whims and whines aren't going to affect anything if you can't seem to solve your issues.
TL;DR : Be useful with your life, and just remember to take a nice look in the mirror when you get yourself screwed over.","#8083

So tbh I know transitioning to university is hard. Especially when you're an international student and come from India. Emotionally, it's draining because you're away from the place you've called home literally your entire life. You're physically adapting to a different climate. You're literally mentally adjusting to a different way of life and different culture.
But the biggest challenged I've faced up till now is learning how to be comfortable wiping my ass with paper and not fucking water. WTF North America.","#8053

The more university goes on, the more I realize all my old high school ""best friends"" were really just my friends because of circumstance. Now that we don't have school together anymore, we barely have time to meet up. When we did, it was awkward, and I couldn't joke with them like I did before. I message them, but the conversations become short and awkward, and the amount of things I've had in common with them has dwindled significantly since our school journey together ended. I just wish I could go back to the time where I could talk with them about everything and anything. Did I change so much as to lose you guys as my friends? Am I just overreacting? Is it just me being my awkward self? I hope we can rebuild our friendship, not just because of circumstance this time, even if it takes awhile.
I miss you guys.","#8044

One day I shit in the staff washroom (normally I try to hold it in until I get home, as boys think it's weird girls poop). Then dreadfully, I realized that the toilet was broken and wouldn't flush. Not wanting to be the person to leave a shit in the toilet (or embarrass myself by having someone fix and flush it for me), I reached in and plucked it out and put it in the garbage can instead. With my bare hands. It was hard enough to handle and was more of a chunky sausage. Haven't told anyone until this day. I was the only one who knew why the smell in the staff washroom wasn't going away for the rest of the shift.
Looking back on it now I believe leaving it was probably the better idea, I truly don't know what was into me that day","#7973

I do Korean skincare routine everyday, this superior routine can cut my 50-year-old face by 10 years because it has 10 steps, and is vastly superior to any other routines on earth. I earned my Korean aesthetics license two years ago, and I have been looking younger every day.
I speak Korean fluently, both Southern and the Northern dialects, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Korean history and their such juche ideology, which I follow 100%.
When I get my Korean visa, I am moving to Gangnam to attend a prestigious High School to earn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an idol working at JYP Entertainment or a chaebol!
I own several hanboks, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Korea, so I can fit in easier. I shake hands and bow to my elders and seniors and speak Korean as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.

Did Open Kitchen stop serving BUTTER CHICKEN on Wednesdays? That's like the only thing I look forward to other then the Wednesday frog. Thank you UBC Food Services, you just robbed both money and the smooth, silky, tasty texture of the one and only BUTTER CHICKEN from a first year student.

Am I the only person who doesn't see the point in attending lectures? If the professor posts the lecture slides online (which basically all of them do) whats the point of going to an hour long class to just hear them go on long explanations that are unnecessary and answer stupid questions. I can learn all the material from a 50 minute lecture in 20 minutes of my own time going through the slides. And while you might argue that they mention stuff in class that might not appear on the slides, I've never once attended a lecture and found it necessary to write down what they have said. They are a waste of time. Btw I am a 90%+ student who gets to study less than the average person because of this.","#7737

I like to think that I'm a pretty succesful and respected person, particularly academically and careerwise. I get 90+ in most of my classes and can land almost any job within my field offers of six figure salaries. However, I feel so completely empty all the time that I can't help but think of myself as a failure.
I've never held a girls hand, let alone go on a date or have sex. My only interaction with girls is in the context of acquaintances that talk to me about classes/homework. I fucking hate this and it seems like despite my efforts, I haven't been able to change anything.
I make an effort to dress well and be a nice/caring person. I put effort into my appearance by dieting and working out constantly. I put myself out there by trying to make friends and interact with girls. I've downloaded Tinder (< 10 matches, 0 responses to conversation).
Any girl I talk to isn't interested in the conversation and typically the conversation ends after being extremely one-sided for its duration. I went and looked back at some of my text conversations with girls, I sent messages at 5x their rate they do. I try to just talk to them about shared interests and they respond after prolonged delays (even after having read the message) with short and low effort responses.
I don't know how to fucking deal with this. I really hope it wont always be like this because living without a girlfriend is fucking torture for me. I feel like I'm missing out on such a vital and important part of life right now. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me and I don't know how much longer I can take this...","#7706

My parents always used to tell me about how amazing university was, and how they met so many wonderful people who they had a lot in common with and made great friends but I don't see it. It doesn't matter how friendly I am, or how considerate, no one seems to care. I thought I made great friends in the beginning, until we went out one night and someone I thought I could trust sexually assaulted me, and I can barely look at myself any more. It isn't the first time something like this has happened to me before, but I reminded me of the first which still keeps me up at night. It was someone I thought I could trust back then too.
This time, I shrugged it off. Figured it was no big deal, and let the guy off easy because I couldn't face that again.
But now every time I'm around men I'm frightened. If it's someone I've known for a while it's usually okay, but if they're unfamiliar I can't take it.
I can't go to parties any more because any time a guy comes near me and I don't have someone familiar next to me I freak out.
I feel so depressed and any time I try to talk to anyone they say they're too busy, they have too much to study for. I get it, people are busy, but if someone could just stop and listen I would be so grateful.
I don't trust counsellors due to bad childhood experiences with them and no one seems to care how I feel. Even when I'm around people who I think are my friends I feel out of place. I don't want to be here any more. I don't want to be anywhere any more.","#7675

OH. MY. FUCKING. GOD.
Can we all just take a moment to realize how stressful chemistry labs are? Or any science lab for that matter? Initially, three hours allocated for a lab seemed generous, but was I wrong...
Firstly, only TEN MINUTES are allocated for students to write a in-lab quiz worth TWENTY marks. I often find myself only half way through the quiz when there are two minutes left, causing my hands to tremble and shake attempting to finish my paper. Not to mention those TINY 'SHARP-EL510' calculators are a pain in the ass to use.
Also, some of us can’t help that we are slower than others at conducting labs, yet no sympathy is given, and you'll get kicked out of the laboratory when the time is up. None of the TA’s give a rat’s ass if you haven’t completed your data, they are 100% comfortable with awarding you no marks if you don’t finish on time. When the time was up and I needed to calculate my final results, my TA snatched my lab manual right out of my hand!!
It is almost as if they expect us to know how to perform the experiment flawlessly for the first time, when in reality nobody knows what they’re doing, so the entire room is just students wandering cluelessly like chickens with their heads sliced off!!
There needs to be a better way of managing the time for lab sessions, because it’s way too overwhelming. I can honestly say that lab session are one of THE most STRESSFUL things I have ever been through.
Ok. Rant session over. Bye.","#7633

In the spirit of mental health awareness day, I would like to share a little bit of my personal struggles. I'm my own worst enemy when it comes to properly dealing with my emotions and wellbeing as I tend to think of emotions as stupid and weak (personally). I have unpredictable depressive episodes caused by who knows what. The biggest and most prevalent enemy is my anxiety. And I'm not talking about basic nerves, but crippling anxiety that turns me into an absolute crazy person. On the exterior I seem calm and collected. My friends often ask how I seem to balance good grades in school, working a demanding job, and a personal life with my partner. I usually just laugh and make a joke about how everyone lives in a state of perpetual stress. But what I really want to say is that I don't balance these things. I'm actually struggling everyday to keep myself from falling apart. I constantly feel like I'm losing my mind and that everyone around me actually wants me gone. I go through the motions and keep up appearances but it's just a facade. My boyfriend and I have been together for years and I still convince myself that he secretly hates me. The same goes for my best friends, who I constantly doubt because I don't believe anyone is capable of liking me. Its nothing they've done and because of that I don't think it's fair to put that pressure on them. So I keep my mouth shut. It affects my school performance as well. I sit mostly silent during discussion in class because I have a deep fear of saying something stupid. I can just imagine everyone turning to look at me like ""how did she even get into UBC?"". The pure hatred I feel for myself stretches beyond anything comprehendable. Everyday I wonder why I'm still here when there are other people who deserve to be in my place. My mind is a god damn living hell. I know these sound childish and small in comparison to other peoples problems. I'm not looking for validation or sympathy. But I thought maybe if someone could relate to how I feel, they wouldn't feel so alone. So anyways, if you can relate to this please don't do what I have done. Find help. Its not healthy to be like this. I'm a hypocrite, but I'm a hypocrite who wants others to feel better than I do.","#7538

I'm really curious to what people think of inter-race dating. I find girls of an ethnicity different than mine attractive, but only ever really see people who are the same ethnicity date. Is it as simple as ""of course, you can date anyone you want"" or is there more to it like it depends on what ethnicity you are?

I'm terrified of going through anything like that again and, as a result, am forcing myself to go out and spend time with people. There's nothing wrong with that, of course.

I am a 3rd year international student at UBC. But unlike many other internationals, my family is broke af. So my parents basically got a loan, with the help of all my relatives, to pay my tuition. I promised to my parents that I will pay back once I graduate. And they trusted me. They believed I have potential.
But now I am realizing that I am not capable to live up to their expectation. My life is honestly a joke that has been taken too far. Heck, I am not even sure if anyone will hire me even if I do graduate. I hate my current program so damn much and my gpa is shitty garbage.
One day, I was talking to my friend about how difficult I am. Then he told me as a joke, to just kill myself if I fail to pay the loan back. I laughed but that hit me hard.
And I couldn't stop thinking about the idea dying. If I die, I will be just able to sleep and rest forever. Never worrying about anything. Why haven't I killed myself already? Then I felt my heart tearing when I think of my parents and all the debts they will have, I prayed to die of an accident so my family can get some money from insurance.

As a first year conservative student taking a Political Science course, I’ve become increasingly concerned for freedom of speech. When applying to UBC and registering for a POLI course, I was heavily warned by my parents and many friends about how liberal the school was. I knew it… but I still registered in good faith.
I’m not surprised that the TA in my discussion group is liberal.
I am disappointed, however, of how she made the environment a place where I feel restricted and isolated. The TA led our first discussion by expressing many of her opinions as facts. It was clear from the start that she had no intention of being impartial or open to my ideas.
She has the “I know best because I studied it, so you’re wrong” mentality. I understand you’re a PhD student with significantly more knowledge than I do… but that doesn’t make my opinions any less legitimate.
I was warned, and I should've listened. I feel like I’ll be penalized if I openly express what I am thinking. For a school that boasts about its diversity, this is pretty shitty.","#7239

The VP Academics candidate Franz came up to me the other day to pitch his platform to me. Though I tried to see his point of view, as someone who has been raped at UBC I have never been so shocked and disappointed. I wish I had given him a hard time about how his platform excludes so many people on this diverse campus and really doesn't address any existing problems. Getting rid of trigger warnings? Really? I have never even been in a class where a ""trigger warning"" was issued (maybe they exist, but if so, who really cares? if it doesn't apply to you, just ignore it). And maybe, instead of complaining about the use of the term ""rape culture"", and claiming ""boys will be boys"", how will you prevent these terrible crimes or support victims? Honestly, I just feel sorry you're so TRIGGERED by other people's struggles & how they cope with them (things that REALLY do not affect you) ... I didn't even know there was an election going on but really glad Franz informed me, because I voted for the other guy :-) I am extremely lucky that I lived through my experience and do not have a need for trigger warnings/safe spaces/etc but for anyone that voted for him/agrees with his POV, please try to imagine yourself in a situation where you may appreciate them and have some compassion. Just because those problems don't apply to you, doesn't mean it isn't very real for other people on this campus!","#7236

I have never even been in a class where a ""trigger warning"" was issued (maybe they exist, but if so, who really cares? if it doesn't apply to you, just ignore it). And maybe, instead of complaining about the use of the term ""rape culture"", and claiming ""boys will be boys"", how will you prevent these terrible crimes or support victims? Honestly, I just feel sorry you're so TRIGGERED by other people's struggles & how they cope with them (things that REALLY do not affect you) ... I didn't even know there was an election going on but really glad Franz informed me, because I voted for the other guy :-) I am extremely lucky that I lived through my experience and do not have a need for trigger warnings/safe spaces/etc but for anyone that voted for him/agrees with his POV, please try to imagine yourself in a situation where you may appreciate them and have some compassion.

It's honestly so fucking frustrating when I see someone, who is clearly capable of standing for a while, cut the line to get a seat and not have anyone stop them. You line cutters are just assholes. I hope that one day you'll try to cut in front of me so that I can quickly stop you in your tracks, tell you to line up, and watch you take a walk of shame all the way to the back of the line. I've done that to many others and I'll never stop standing up for myself and the people behind me. I don't know who the hell you think you are, but your self-entitled asses have to wait in line like the rest of us. Even if it's a friend who moves to your spot, why don't you move to the back of the line with your friend instead. Don't be selfish and try to think about the people behind you waiting.

I wonder how spoiled they must have been as children and how they will react once they have to handle things on their own and deal with people working for their own goals and dismissing their needs. I would love to see a world where everyone is kind-hearted, compassionate and empathetic towards other humans, and it is definitely a standard I hold myself to. But when I see people complain and cry about how unfair life is and how cruel others are-- stand up for yourself and put them in their place, or brush it off and forget about it.

Dear first years science students (or literally anyone who does this),
Don't start packing up, walking out of class, wiping out your phone, and talking to your friends until it hits the fifty minute mark on the clock. The class doesn't end at 11:40, it ends at 11:50. If the prof ends early, that's cool, but when a prof is literally still going over the last slide and it is 11:45, give him a little respect and chill till he is done. One or two people who need to skip out early because of their own sitchuation are all good but not all 200 students.

Honestly, this Sauder School of Snakes thing has gotten maybe a LITTLE out of hand. It's Imagine Day, the official day in which we welcome all first years into our big UBC community, the day in which we are suppose to unite our differences and celebrate our diveristy in the stadium, the day in which we take pride in our own faculties as we chant but also RESPECT the other faculties' students for their achievements in being admitted to their program. It was an amazing pep rally as it always has been, but the one thing that stuck out to me was the loud echoing ""ssssss"" and ""boooo"" in the stadium when Sauder was introduced. I get it, a little competition is great, but not when it becomes hostile and disrespectful. I admit at first I thought it was funny, but that was because I didn't put myself in the shoes of others. Imagine being a first year commerce student intimidated by the already somewhat menacing thing known as univeristy and that's the first welcome they get from other people. I mean I doubt a lot of Sauder students will feel defeated being the confident and social students they are, but what about the faculty staff sitting on stage? How does hissing at another faculty in a large, public and PROFESSIONAL setting make you feel any better about your own faculty? How would your deans and undergrad society presidents feel? Come on people, we are here cheering for the fact that we are all in this TOGETHER at UBC. Let's make it a warm welcome for everyone. If you're going to make these jokes, make them at your friends whom you know, not in front Dr. Santa Ono, not in front all those who prepared so hard to make sure the pep rally on Imagine Day is the best you will get, and especially not in front of those confused first yer students looking to find a sense of community at UBC.

Is anyone else a bit worried about UBC's (lack of) free speech? I think this is an incredibly important topic for an academic institution who is responsible for the creation and constructive criticism of new ideas. People tend to have extreme and emotional views on this subject and the recent political events are pushing those extreme views even more. However we need some level headed people who are not emotionally invested to talk through this so that we can strike a balance. On one hand freedom of expression and freedom to safely propose and criticize ideas (especially ideas which do not fit with popular opinion) without being persecuted, is a critical part of university. On the other hand, the right for ALL of our students to feel safe on campus is important. Currently we do not have a balance and many students are stating that they do not feel comfortable expressing any ideas which are outside of popular opinion for fear of backlash. This is academia and it is integral to the integrity of our institution that we consider both sides of a subject, even if we find one side distasteful or morally abhorrent. Shutting down people you disagree with and preventing them from expressing their opinions does not help anyone.
Side note: the UBC Free Speech Club are assholes and I'm in no way associate myself with them.","#6975

Dear SJWs: I am asking for your help.
You've been able to change the world over. From works against racism, to women's feminism or whatever cause that stirred you to act. But there is a gross neglect on efforts against heightism. I'm a 5'3 male who has been denied because of my height. We get along great, we've even dated and the sex was great. However, I've been explicitly told that she would not be in a public relationship with me because I'm too short. I cannot. Fucking. Change that. I like her a lot. And maybe she's at fault for not looking past that. Maybe she's not. But I don't think she's entirely to blame. Society hasn't ever stood up for people like me. At least, not enough to make a difference. It requires an enormous amount of courage on her part to walk side by side with someone like me whilst standing at 5'11. Yet I have to ask, why is that kind of courage even necessary in the first place? It's easy to say, ""fuck what others think,"" but in reality, what others think sometimes has an impact on how we behave. We are social creatures after all, it's natural. Despite being a sexy Hobbit, I cannot escape this stigma. It's ignored or downplayed too often. Have you seen Tinder profiles? ""Under 6'3? Go away."" This. Is. Body shaming. Arguably the worst kind because not only is there nothing we can do to change height, but there is a deficit of defenders against this kind of body shaming. And did you read that right?? I can't believe I'm even considering changing myself physically just to end all the crap I put up with for being short.
Chances are, she and I won't make it. But if I can help couples in the future avoid this by raising awareness, I'll find some comfort in knowing something meaningful came out of my...shortcomings.
Jokes aside, this is a serious request to all true SJWs. Please help advocate against heightism.","#6967

I've always assumed that university would cost a fortune (like upwards of three-quarters of a million each year) because I keep reading news article about how people can't afford it. Was a little worried about that when I got accepted to UBC.
Then I come to Canada, and find out it's actually cheaper than I expected (phew). I also realized the average salaries of people here is how much my friends and I spend on partying/eating out every month.

Ladies, for those of us who value good sex in a relationship, let my experience be a lesson to us all: sleep with the damn guy before you agree to be his girlfriend.
My man is the ideal boyfriend: he's kind and caring, emotionally supportive, and is a wonderful cook. Of all my guy friends in the greater Vancouver area, he's probably the nicest person any of his friends has ever met. He's very smart, and has an almost guaranteed career in his future too; I can safely assume he's probably the most my-Asian-mom-approved candidate for a future husband out there.
The problem? He sexes like a virgin, and is never up to try new and more stimulating stuff (positions, foreplay technique, my 16-inch 8000-horseforce vibrator, etc...), even after my constant attempts at communication.
And the worst thing is that four days before he confessed he liked me and asked me out, I hooked up with his fuccboi roommate. And it was some mind-shattering, cosmic-moving, USDA-approved Grade AAAwesome sex. Like make-hardcore-atheists-believe-in-God good sex. Came so hard mothafuckas wanna fine me (dat shitcray).
Now bear in mind this was before I officially knew my current guy liked me (I already kind of liked him, and was starting to get a vibe...), and I'm the type of girl who would never in 1000 years cheat on someone I've made a promise to. I absolutely love my current boyfriend. BUT every time I come over and see his roommate I always have a split-moment of sexual frustration.
I know, I know. A lot of commentors are going to say how I'm a shallow bitch who doesn't know how good she's got it, or takes my boyfriend for granted. And I agree; I'm grateful for having such a wholesome man. But it's still sexually frustrating, and all I'm saying is that you should test the waters first so you don't end up in this predickament like me.
The consequence for my previous hastily-given ""Yes"" is my present lack of ""Yes yes yes yesyesYesYesYES"".","#6784

Me and this guy had always had a crush on each other, but we weren’t official or anything. (Mind you, he’s not a fuckboy who goes around messing with other girls. In fact, he’s really cute and somewhat shy.)
I was sick of our relationship developing so slow and I listened to my friends’ advice to go out with this other guy and to ignore the shy guy. This other guy was actually really cocky but very extroverted, so he was a fun guy to mess around with. Anyways, we ended up hooking up multiple times and left it at that. It was a short fling where neither of us got emotionally attached.
I ended up going out with the shy guy a couple of times afterwards (he was the one I was really interested in) and I told him about what happened with the cocky guy (they know each other). He was devastated and now doesn’t want anything to do with me. I can tell he’s really hurt and he doesn’t care about me anymore.
Now I know all of you will start telling me that it was his fault for not making a move and that he has no right to be upset or to judge my past relationships. But I honestly feel like it was my fault now that I have put myself into his shoes. I knew he liked me, but I chose to ignore him. While he was not going out and meeting girls because he was interested in me (and making attempts to court me), I was sleeping with another guy every other night. The fact that a lot of girls are attracted to the shy guy makes me feels worse, because he actively ignored girls for me. But all I did was hook up with another guy secretly while continuing to lead him on. And then for me to be cruel enough to return back to him after I dated the cocky guy must’ve made him feel like a consolidation prize. I have no idea how I could be so cold-hearted to tell him all that while having a huge grin on my face and pretending it’s no big deal.
I can actually tell he really cared for me too. He looked after me, always was willing to help when I needed help, got excited about my personal successes (and never bragged about his successes), and had my best interest in mind. I told him I was too busy with school and he believed me. And all I did was betray his trust of me by hooking up with another guy.
He has a new girlfriend now. I can tell he's still hurt by me but is a lot happier with his girlfriend. I hope she treats him a lot better than I do, because he definitely deserves it. 😭","#6780

It was a short fling where neither of us got emotionally attached.
I ended up going out with the shy guy a couple of times afterwards (he was the one I was really interested in) and I told him about what happened with the cocky guy (they know each other). He was devastated and now doesn’t want anything to do with me. I can tell he’s really hurt and he doesn’t care about me anymore.
Now I know all of you will start telling me that it was his fault for not making a move and that he has no right to be upset or to judge my past relationships. But I honestly feel like it was my fault now that I have put myself into his shoes. I knew he liked me, but I chose to ignore him. While he was not going out and meeting girls because he was interested in me (and making attempts to court me), I was sleeping with another guy every other night. The fact that a lot of girls are attracted to the shy guy makes me feels worse, because he actively ignored girls for me. But all I did was hook up with another guy secretly while continuing to lead him on. And then for me to be cruel enough to return back to him after I dated the cocky guy must’ve made him feel like a consolidation prize. I have no idea how I could be so cold-hearted to tell him all that while having a huge grin on my face and pretending it’s no big deal.
I can actually tell he really cared for me too. He looked after me, always was willing to help when I needed help, got excited about my personal successes (and never bragged about his successes), and had my best interest in mind. I told him I was too busy with school and he believed me. And all I did was betray his trust of me by hooking up with another guy.
He has a new girlfriend now. I can tell he's still hurt by me but is a lot happier with his girlfriend. I hope she treats him a lot better than I do, because he definitely deserves it. 😭",,1501082395,,,91,48,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1595739323777688&id=1287650764586547,

Having dated around in NA and EU for some time before and after my undergrad at UBC, I've noticed something that's much more prevalent within the Vancouver dating scene than anywhere else.
A girl expecting a man to pay on dates, ""buy me *insert food here*"", ""take me *insert place here* for vacation"", ""take me on a shopping spree""
= totally normal, as it is part of the gentlemen's duty.
A man asking girl if she'd be willing to put out after an expensive date
= ""God, you're not fucking entitled to sex""
Ladies, if you'd like to be treated as an equal partner, then contribute as an equal partner. If I have to essentially pay you to spend time with you, you're either a celebrity hosting a paid brunch, or an escort selling a service.","#6713

I work at the Chan Centre, which means I was present for 21/26 of the UBC graduations these past two weeks.
I'd like to point out that, with the exception of the Engineering graduations, I only witnessed two ceremonies where graduates threw their caps in the air, and even then, only a few partook in the tradition. Engineers, on the other hand, were completely ecstatic at the thought of throwing that black piece of fabric and cardboard towards the heavens.
As an usher, I loathe the hat throwing because it means we take longer to clean the theater and the next group of patrons gets agitated for having to wait so long. (Have you ever had a hundred people take out their irritation on you??)
As a human being, though, the cap throwing was one of the highlights of my week! Hearing President Ono make the same speech over and over and over and over again gets quite stale, so the cap throwing broke the monotony and made me remember that I wasn't just living this same nightmare 21 times over. (No, your ceremony isn't a nightmare in itself; monotony is)
So thanks, engineers. Go do all the fun stuff Santa talked about in his speech. But for the love of all things good... CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELVES.

A very tired usher","#6538

I also got my sick leave extended by 2 or so weeks because I was actually trying to tell them that I wanted to quit instead but I was so hesitant and scared that they didn't understand what I was saying and ended up extending my sick leave. Now I don't know what to tell them or when to say it because they have been so nice to me. It's not the job at all. It's just me. I just don't want to work anymore but I always have this fear of disappointing anyone. No wonder why I have so much trouble breaking up with others in relationships.

I never tried too hard in high school, took it as kind of a joke. I played games all day and didn’t do much homework. Graduated with a mid-high 70s average and went to the only university that accepted my application, University of Alberta. My parents wanted me to do medicine (big surprise) and I just wanted my parents to be happy so I studied in the Faculty of Science. After my first year at UofA I basically failed all my classes and got kicked out, I lived on res and all I did was play games and party, I had no idea what I was doing. I had to confess to my parents about everything that happened, how I’ve been kicked out of university and failed every class. They were extremely disappointed and I felt completely crushed. After being kicked out, I came back to Vancouver and attended Langara for 3 years. The first two years I was totally lost in life. I had no clue what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go, and basically, I just smoked a lot of weed and watched a lot of anime. After my first semester at Langara I was put on Academic Probation, and after second semester I was 1% away from getting kicked out, luckily my prof was super nice and bumped me. I took all sorts of classes, trying to find my “passion” but nothing seemed to attract my attention, until I started taking business classes. Even though I didn’t particularly love accounting, or marketing, or economics etc. Something about business and those classes sparked my interest and I really enjoyed them. Ever since high school I’ve always dreamed about going to UBC, my entire extended family was very academically accomplished; Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, Tsinghua, these are just some of the Universities that my uncles/aunts/and cousins have graduated from. So, you can probably imagine the disappointment my parents felt when I told them that not only am I not going to study medicine, but I failed out of university. I felt like a complete and utter failure. In the last semester of my 2nd year at Langara, I received news my parents were getting divorced, and let’s just say that was one of the most traumatizing experiences I’ve ever had. Around the same time, I met my, now, loving girlfriend who gave me encouragement, motivation, and pushed me to strive for the life I have always wanted. I had found a reason to work hard, a reason to go through the suffering of all-nighters and studying day in day out. And in the span of 1 year, I went from failing classes to getting on the Deans Honour Roll, and most importantly successfully transferring into UBC Sauder. Moral of the story is; try to find a reason. Something worth fighting for, something worth going through the struggles for, it could be for yourself, for our planet, or for somebody else. But get to know yourself and what motivates you, you will be surprised how far you can go once you have the determination to get there. Go travel, spend time with people you care about, do things that you think will add value to yourself, and don’t worry too much about your future. As cheesy as it sounds I believe that everything in life happens for a reason, and that life is full of good, and bad, surprises. Enjoy all your experiences and it’s important to always look up and think positive. Aside from that, I am super excited to start attending UBC in September!! And I hope that I can prove that not everyone in Sauder only cares about money, their egos, and themselves. We can be sincere, respectful, and bring goodness to this world! #IAMUBC","#6481

But get to know yourself and what motivates you, you will be surprised how far you can go once you have the determination to get there. Go travel, spend time with people you care about, do things that you think will add value to yourself, and don’t worry too much about your future. As cheesy as it sounds I believe that everything in life happens for a reason, and that life is full of good, and bad, surprises. Enjoy all your experiences and it’s important to always look up and think positive. Aside from that, I am super excited to start attending UBC in September!! And I hope that I can prove that not everyone in Sauder only cares about money, their egos, and themselves. We can be sincere, respectful, and bring goodness to this world! #IAMUBC",,1494826865,,,1905,159,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1520662154618739&id=1287650764586547,

I have overcome so much this year... Super proud and would love nothing more than to air it all out, one last time.
In 2017: I....
- missed a month and a half of school for medical reasons
- found out my boyfriend cheated and walked away, dignity in tact
- lost my grandfather to pancreatic cancer
- taught myself Ochem 233 off YouTube
- got a three-month puppy to help me cope with anxiety but, had him pass away two weeks after we got him... (Friend accidentally dropped him)
- Discovered a lump in my chest, turned out to be benign (post-biopsy)
- Decided I fucking hated science and was far more interested in Business, 1/2 way through my bachelors. Took the leap of fate...
- Quit a job I had kept for over 2.5yrs and sought an internship, I most definetly wasn't qualified for. Landed a position at the firm anyway, now make more than my MBA father...
I embodied the girl and the trash bag gif for most of this year. My efforts lead to disappointments, one after another... But, for some reason I pulled through and have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Wish I had the courage to post this publically and thank each and ever friend, colleague and advisor who tirelessly stood by my side. For the first time in forever, I'm genuinely happy.","#6477

Seeing people post about having a single F or some stupid shit is seriously the most annoying thing. Did your parents not let you fail? Did you get everything handed to you? You ever wanna smack a bitch who complains about failing a single paper in a course they get 80+% in? Jesus Fucking Christ. I want to understand what gives you that attitude that any gpa sub A- makes you a failure, because you're going to be dealing with people like me your whole life.
I'm 100% a terrible student, I fully admit it. Doesn't mean I don't have friends, a job, and things that make me happy. See people on this page, friends on fb/whatnot, and on /r/UBC post things about how 'their life is ending' without a /s or any sarcasm really need to re-evaluate their life.
I get some people need an average to keep a scholorship to pay for school, or to get into med/dental/pharm/[instert competitive program here] but you should realize failing one course or paper isn't the end of the world. Take your L and learn from it.

My best friend and used to have another friend for our first two years at UBC, the three of us were like three musketeers, we were always together. But this other friend was so toxic, she would insult us all the time, belittle our intelligence, was possessive of guys she wasn't even dating/hooking up with/ or talking too and would accuse us of trying to flirt with them or hook up with them. So this year my best friend and I slowly faded out our friendship with her, and honestly it was probably the best thing we ever did. No more stress, no more emotional abuse, and no more constant tears and drama. The reason I'm writing this is to encourage others who are dealing with abusive friendships to end things. Just because a relationship is not romantic or sexual does not mean it can't be abusive, please take care of yourself and make sure you are surrounding yourself with people who truly care about you.","#6436

I've never had a girlfriend or have never been in a relationship. Apart from that I am still a virgin and have never been kissed by a girl. I think I look ugly. Now the trolls in comment would be like get yourself out there talk to girls. Well, I've done all that but nothing has worked till now and I think it's affecting my self confidence a lot. Also, walking on main mall, I feel happy and sad at the same time. Happy because people are in love and having fun but I feel sad and frustrated because why can't I be in a relationship as well. I blame myself, my genes and god for my situation. As a result, I am depressed and am turning to drugs to help me combat all the anxiety and stress that comes with knowing that 'you can't get a girl'. I smoke weed everyday, drink alcohol and do any other drug that could get me high. I don't even want to be in a relationship but the feeling of not having the 'game to get a girl' is killing me from inside everyday.
I've also asked out some girls but most of them declined in a mature way but some just laughed at my face implying that I am way out of their league. Trust me, you don't want someone tell you that you are way too unattractive for them to date.
I did some soul searching and reached to a conclusion that I am not going to run behind girls anymore and try to focus on things that I like. Meditation has helped me a lot. I've stopped consuming any sort of drugs apart from caffeine and I must say sobriety is underrated and relationship is a hoax.
So, to all my brothers and sisters of UBC who feel that they are in the same boat as I am then please don't let it impact your academics or self worth. You are better than all the 'hoes' who aren't going to be loyal and are with you either because of your looks or money. Keep faith and do what you do best and enjoy it. I also realised that in my search for a girlfriend and the depression that followed, I grew apart from my actual friends and family; people who already love me. I am going to respect the friendships that I already have and will get to know my friends even more and be there when they need me any time of the day.
To end my confession, I would like to ask the students of UBC that if you are declining someone's proposal to go out with them, do so in a respectful or humane manner because your response could have a big impact on a person's life.
I am sorry if this post is too long or depressing, this is my life right now and I am sure there might be other people who are in the same situation as I am. It might probably help them out.
PS: I also paid a prostitute once to have sex with me but my morals didn't allow me to do it and I ended up paying 250$ to a girl who sells her body and was giving me a lecture on how my life is fucked up because I do way too many drugs.","#6374

When I lived at Gage, I shared a wall with a guy who was obsessed with heavy bass music and left his music on even when he wasn't in his room. It was so loud, I had to wait until quiet hours to go back to my room. So, one weekend, when all of my roommates went home, I turned on Chinese opera music on full blast.

Half the time, I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. The other half, I'm just so pissed at him for how shit he can be sometimes. This is one of those times. It sucks to be the one always asking the other to spend time with you and never or barely the other way around. Stop making them do all the work. It also doesn't hurt to actually make the other person feel like you like spending time with them aside from when you guys are sleeping together. And if you won't be seeing the person you're dating over the summer, at least act like it and make the other person feel like you actually care about it. Also, stop making them feel like they come after your friends and that you only hang out with them when you have nothing better to do. I don't think he does any of this intentionally, but it still sucks to feel like this and I'm just especially set off by it all right now.","#6359

My faith in humanity increases during finals. We spend hours on end in the library, and everyone just kinda trusts each other when they wanna go to the washroom, or for a drink, or to grab food or something. Sometimes people ask strangers around them to watch their stuff (even though you literally don't know them), and other times people just get up and leave, and it's implied that your neighbors have gotchu. It's a good vibe. Like we're all in this together. (I realize this may not always be the case and things still do get stolen, but the general trusting atmosphere is refreshing. I doubt it's like this on most campuses.)","#6349

UBC Engineering was my dream program and now it's become my nightmare....Literally, idk who thought putting three physics courses and two math courses in one semester in one semester is a good idea. There's no time to pursue other interests when such a tight timetable exists...To pursue mine, I literally had to make time by adding on two courses and as a result took an overwhelming 8 courses this semester... Physics and math were literally my favorite subjects and now I'm struggling to even pass the courses. The profs for the most part don't care and don't teach well while consistently maintaining class averages of 60s....Visiting some prof office hours are often impossible as class schedules often overlap and if you do find time, the visits are often short due to a long line of students and them simply not feeling too helpful..
I've made connections with a few of my professors in elective courses and one of them persuaded me to pursue a different course and future. I wanted to transfer but my grades are in the deep pits of Bs,Cs, and D's in most of the physics and math courses and can't even get out... It really sucks because this whole year, I've buried myself in work while trying to maintain my sanity..but really....it's a little too much. Now 2nd year engineering program selections are coming up. Literally what can I do? I'm practically gonna be stuck studying something I have zero interest in thanks to my lower grades...Literally...can't take it any more.","#6214

Regardless of how unsavoury, bigoted, illogical, or invalid a person's views may be, you are only going to further cement their beliefs by shutting them down and invalidating them as a person. If you are going to engage with them take the time to investigate! Always ask WHY! The root causes of beliefs are often more telling than the beliefs themselves and are what actually need to be addressed! Having been on both sides of this situation, it is astounding to me that more people don't understand this, but instead think that shutting someone out, making broad assumptions and generalizations, or labelling them as stupid etc is going to achieve something.

Not only is this extremely patronizing, but it absolutely does not pave the road for healthy discussion with that awful arrogant holier-than-thou attitude. It's also unnecessarily antagonizing. Even though I was disgusted and offended by a lot of the comments on the recent post about the reconciliation pole (I am of Musqueam descent myself), a lot of the comments trying to defend my people also made me sick. Just because someone said something ""racist"" doesn't mean it's okay to completely shut out their opinions. Everyone has both subconscious and conscious biases whether you like it or not. Recognizing those biases is very important for everyone, and being told to ""educate yourself"" is certainly NOT helpful. Education is EVERYONE's responsibility.","#6197

omg okay I just really need to let this out bc it's something that I've had to, and always will, deal with. The thing about me is that I tend to push people away. I often feel like I get too annoying and that people just don't wanna talk with me. And it really affects the way I make friends. Like for example, I've been talking to guys online, and I am generally a social person. But, once i actually feel a connection with people I tend to just push them away. I don't know what's wrong with me and it's really frustrating bc it makes it hard for me to make new relationships. Like this guy that i've been talking to for almost a month now, we used to continuously talk to each other via text/ calls, but now it just feels different. He tried to help me cope with some personal problems one night, and i just pushed him away. I really like being his friend and I've been trying to make conversation with him, but he seems like he's not putting the same effort like he did before. IDK The thing about me is that i am a textbook overthinker!! I overthink every single detail about a text, a snap, and just everything in general. This makes it really hard for me to text first, but with him I've been trying really hard. It's just i don't know what to do anymore. I really LOVE talking with him. He's the first guy that i've ever been comfortable and truly my open self with, and i don't wanna lose that connection & that posible long-term relationship. IDK. I really wish that it wasn't this hard for me to just express things. Ugh","#6145

So I never graduated from HS. I was doing really good until grade 10, then my best friends left me because I was not ""popular"". I felt really bad, and switched to another school, because it was closer to me, and there was no point in continuing to go my school when I had to watch my best friends ignore me in the hallways for no other reason than they wanted to be ""popular"". I had a really rough time in my new school, it was a lot harder to study there, and I was just so devastated that I didn't even try to make friends. I would just eat my lunch alone in a stall in the washrooms. Then, I started to skip school. I would only go once every week. This led to them contacting my parents, and my mom, whom already I did not have a great relationship with, became very angry with me. She kept telling me how I was shaming the entire family, because they immigrated to this country so that I could have a better life, but I was failing myself and them. In grade 12, I changed my parents' phone number in school to my own cellphone number, and started to make up fake report cards to show to my parents. They thought I was improving, but in reality I was more troubled than ever. Anyways, I failed to graduate HS, even though my school counsellor was nice enough to let me go to the ceremony, and I remember that I went to visit UBC once to see how I could get into the English department, and felt like I could never study there. After grade 12, I went to study at a college ( this was a really good choice, because it was so much cheaper than UBC, and I could take courses that I liked), and in two years I transferred into UBC. I still remember my first imagine day: sitting in the rose garden , when two years before then at that exact spot, I didn't think I would ever be able to get in to UBC. I felt so proud. Even though I now study psychology in arts, and some times feel bad because everyone seems to be so smart at UBC, I still feel grateful about how much confidence I gained from coming to UBC, and how much it has truly changed my life. I'm going through a rough patch again in life, where I'm losing a person I thought I would spend the rest of my life with, and that has led me to almost fail in two classes, so I had to remind myself that I made my life better once, so I can do it again. For all of you struggling out there, keep on going. You can do it :)","#6113

I stopped going to UBC counselling because of that one condescending lady at the Marine Drive office. I was going through a ton of shit and all I got out of meeting her was feeling incompetent and fake and useless. Trying to talk to her was like explaining math to a fish. And if the fish had the mental capacity to belittle someone for their problems, she could have sat there in front of me instead. It took me four months just to be okay enough to attend lectures.
I know a few people had a similar experience with her and I shall leave this here if you know who I'm talking about. I know a lot of people came out counselling and did amazingly well in the time after and one of them was the one that asked me to give it a try in the first place.

I am turning 22 this year and have never dated anyone. Haven't even held a girls's hand before. You know why? I will tell you. Cuz I am not good looking and my personality is trashy. My accent is funny and I am short like dwarf midget. But you know what most important thing is? I don't give a s***! no matter how many times you guys mock me for being a lorner who can't talk to girls, I do not give a single pinch of s***. You guys simply do not understand that the relationship I am looking for is not some childish and immature kid's play you guys call ""love""(almost vomited typing this word). I have deeper connection with my charizard with perfect IVs and shiny foiled ""origianl"" BEWD(ain't she a beauty) than most of your pathetic relationships. What I am looking for is true affection and companionship. Something pure and respectful. And I am ready to wait unconditionally until I find that special someone who I can vomit out my life to. And I will love her like how Naruto loved Hinata, how Mai Valentine loved her money and how Professor Song loved Doctor. So go ahead make fun of me. I might become a wizard, but I will gladly take it and abraka dabra on all of your faces! And on the last day, I will be the one smiling happily surrounded by my pretty wife and 42 grand children. While using fireballs with my wizard power. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

UBC always promotes itself as this active, outdoors, healthy place dedicated to wellbeing and sustainability but essentially tells first year students to go fuck themselves with this new meal plan. The two huge issues with meal plans were that thwy are financially crippling and the food is shit and their grand idea was to charge even more while promising very little in terms of improvement in food quality?? sure orchard has better food but paying $9 for a damn sandwich or whatever it is isn't the answer.

I'm in a somewhat long-term relationship (about a year and a half) with a guy that I care about deeply but who I think I'm not really in love with anymore. It isn't anything about him: I've identified as bisexual for over five years now, but I'm beginning to think that I'm only attracted to women and other nonbinary people. In a really unfortunate twist of fate, dating my boyfriend has really begun to confirm for me that I'm not sexually attracted to men. The sex isn't bad, in fact, it's pretty great, but it's great because I like having sex, not because I want to have it with him or because I'm attracted to his body. And I honestly find his penis really off-putting whenever I look at it, and the thought of going down on a man ever again in my life disgusts me.
But I love this guy. He's my best friend and I can't imagine my life without him. He's really supportive and I also am so happy to be there for him and to care for him and give him what he needs emotionally. I just don't think I can spend the rest of my life with him or keep being in a romantic and sexual relationship with him. It's also hard because I was his first and he doesn't really believe in sex outside of marriage. And I feel like I compromised his morals and that I should stay with him because of that. I also know he sees himself marrying me and, well, I don't see myself winding up with him long-term. I feel super dishonest keeping on dating him, but I don't want to hurt him by breaking up with him. I don't know what to do. This is killing me.","#5912

You don't have to believe me, I'm sure you won't, but when you encounter him yourself you will know that I spoke the truth. He was gone for 2 years, saving his strength, biding his time.

My friend and I came across a wild encounter the other night. I know the picture is blurry, but that look in his eyes told me everything I needed to know. You don't have to believe me, I'm sure you won't, but when you encounter him yourself you will know that I spoke the truth. He was gone for 2 years, saving his strength, biding his time. He had us thinking he was dead. But now he's returned with a vengeance.

I've heard a countless number of confessions saying they saw someone cute on (insert bus number here) and the only descriptor they will use is the colour of their hair. Well I am going to try and break the trend and give the most detailed description of this cute girl I saw today on the 99.
She had black hair with some sort of colouring in it. She was asian, I think she even mentioned she was Korean but I am not positive. She was standing up while her two friends who both looked Indian were sitting down in front of her while they all talked. She was wearing a small backpack which I believe was dull blue (but don't quote me on that) and lots of silver zippers on the backpack. She wore black shoes with heels and the heels were pretty bulky, not the very thin ones. She had a contagious laugh and was having a conversation about alcohol related experiences with her friends. Right when I got off the bus they were talking about what alcoholic coffees and what a Bailey's Irish Cream was.
Anyways if you read this you will know 100% I am talking about you. I wish I had the chance to talk to you and I most likely would have if you were not talking to your friends. Maybe if you leave some sort of clue in the comments, I can message you and we can get coffee some time.","#5894

I actually have zero friends. Sometimes I go back home from the dorms to get blackout drunk with old high school friends to forget about my problems. But honestly I don't think any of them would see me without drugs/liquor. Truth is, I sabotage myself by pushing people away because I don't want to inconvenience them of the awfulness of talking to me. I'm terrible at conversation and make people really uncomfortable. There's always a little voice in my head saying I'm worthless, why would anyone want to be my friend, etc. And people who used to talk to me and don't now look a lot happier, and I'm glad for them. Everyone says 'get out of your comfort zone' but every time I have, I'd somehow made things worse, so I've given up trying. I have no motivation or energy to go to class, and I can't seem to remember anything, either. Most of my time I spend sleeping or daydreaming about situations that will never happen. But I realized can't do this anymore when I had a brief conversation with a really cool person a couple of days ago. In those 5 minutes I felt more alive than I had in years.

I tend to like to my friend's problems. She usually have more school or social issues and come from a rougher family or whatever. Either way, my own problems tend to be minor when compare to hers, and I just try to be helpful for her and be the listener of her concerns. At the end of the day, I just have to bottle all my small accumulating depressing emotions because she always need more help than I do, and I'm one of the few around her who cares. I don't really mind it for a while, but I don't know how long this can last.","#5733

Regarding the rape meme situation :
I was raped before when I was in this relationship. I was abused and raped for 2 years. Before you judge me and wonder why the hell I stayed, its personal and this is not what this post is about. After the relationship I was and still am traumatized, I go into deep depression and now Im struggling with school , motivation and life in general. But because I go through this, I dont bash people because they make a meme over soemthing that they did not understand how it could negatively affect someone. I can understand where youre coming from, but instead of building an awareness why are you bashing an individual? Does that make you feel better about yourself? Does it make you a better person? If it doesnt make you happy, then ignore it, walk away or educate them. Bashing and going nuts over an individual, who at the end realized and apologized at the end, is not acceptable. Not many people have the courage or realize what they have done, but he has, and he has apologized. How are you supposed to have people back you up if the way you approach it is in negative manner. If you want people to stop, then you cant just have people who been through it, backing you up. You want everyone. So for goodness sake, stop bashing the person, go to counselling or something to be able to approach these type of situations better if it were to happen again and realize that attacking someone over a meme is ridiculous and youre not any better and your personal experience from the past does not justify your rude response.","#5703

""I've never accepted that you were gay. I never have.""
These were the words that my mom wouldn't stop saying tonight. Three years ago, I came out to her, and at first, she took it really hard, but eventually she told me that she would accept me for who I was.
But she lied.
She found out tonight that I had been showing PDA to my partner over the past month that we've been together. She called me out for disrespecting her, that I wasn't thinking about how she would react if other parents or family friends were to see me with someone of the same sex. She says that I am trying way too hard to ""sell"" the fact that I am in a relationship, by merely showing any signs of affection to my partner.
I come from a very traditional Asian family, but my mom has always seemed to be accepting and understanding. That was what I thought...until tonight. She doesn't hate the fact that I have a partner, but rather hates that I refuse to acknowledge her requests to stop showing any affection to my partner.
I've never felt so alone. I've never felt so oppressed and hated for who I am. I have nowhere to go. I have absolutely no money to find a place to stay, to sustain myself for more than a month. My education is paid for by my parents.
I don't know what to do anymore. Especially now, with so much going on in my life already and finals coming up, I don't have time for any of this.","#5568
""I've never accepted that you were gay. I never have.""
These were the words that my mom wouldn't stop saying tonight. Three years ago, I came out to her, and at first, she took it really hard, but eventually she told me that she would accept me for who I was.
But she lied.
She found out tonight that I had been showing PDA to my partner over the past month that we've been together. She called me out for disrespecting her, that I wasn't thinking about how she would react if other parents or family friends were to see me with someone of the same sex. She says that I am trying way too hard to ""sell"" the fact that I am in a relationship, by merely showing any signs of affection to my partner.

UBC housing is ripping us Students off big time. In their new contract for Marine drive res (year round), they raised the monthly fees from 857.55 to 893.24 and that for a 4 shared rooms 2 bathrooms apartment! The big problem is UBC housing has never been under any obligation to have a bar limit over these things. In other words, we don't have rights in these matters.

i'm really sick of being single. i've been told i'm very attractive, fun and cool explicitly by friends or strangers of both genders. Though they it is likely they are just being nice and polite, but the fact that people are trying to compliment me means I'm some narcissist sociopath weirdo, ok? But no one seems to actually be interested. people think i get approached a lot, but the truth is, i make the first moves most of the time, and things never work out. I just want company of people I like. :/
During the week, I usually study non-stop to work on problem sets, prepare for endless midterms, or just simply to not fall THAT behind. When Friday comes and the week is finally over, I look around, no one is by my side and I get depressed. Weekend depression is hitting me real hard. I cant get out of bed on saturdays. Why don't you go out to meet more people?! Because I've spent most of my time alone studying HAHAHAHAHAH. Being a math major sucks, it sucks even more when you are stupid and need extra time to study for that below-average grades. What sucks even more?? Being a girl! Because you are ultra-sensitive and needier comparing to your peers. You would just be wiping off your PMS tears while rushing to write down those pages-long proofs to explain a seemingly trivial result. It takes more discipline to pick yourself up and start moving forward again.","#5493

Not only do we guarantee that every essay (underlined part) is original and not copied, we guarantee the essays to be finished in the shortest time.

So while the honest students break their backs and not sleep just to produce their best work so they can get by, some can just pay for others to do their work for them.

Okay, so this happened back in September and I haven't stopped thinking about it. I'm submitting it here to see if I can get any feedback since this is affecting my grades.
I was walking along Main Mall between classes and I saw this girl who I remember seeing around my high school back in China. She was absolutely stunning that day with her hair flowing down, wearing a crop top and short shorts. I guess it was just different seeing her in something other than that god awful uniform that we had to wear at school. I almost didn't recognize her, but I noticed this tattoo she had on her lower back and I could recognize that tramp stamp anywhere.
After recognizing who she was, I was about to approach her to say hi and see if she recognized me too. Seeing somebody familiar in this foreign place made me much more comfortable and relaxed in my transition to Canada. However, she was with a guy who I assume is local because he is white. They were deep in a conversation and I didn't know if I should approach her or not. Instead, I decided to follow her until maybe they separated to go to their classes and then I could say hi. They kept on walking and it turns out that they were in the same class! I ended up going to their BIOL 121 and sitting a couple of rows behind them and I just watched what they were doing.
When class ended, I continued to follow her and the friend. They were finished their classes for the day and were heading back to Totem. I ended up getting right outside her door and that was the end of my journey. I felt defeated, I never got the chance to say hello. As I was about to leave, I started to hear moans coming from the room. This intrigued me so I stayed outside the door and listened to their raunchy sex. Once I heard the white man finish, I scurried back to my dorm.
Every day, I can't help but think that if I had said hello, I could have been a part of that and we could have had a threesome instead. Should I go back to their room one day and knock and just ask to join in? Ugh! I feel so distressed. Please help.","#5393

I know majority of the students who were accepted to UBC, carry stories from all over the world and share some of the most valuable minds, that is why there is a personal profile section, to accept only the best. However, to those toxic uncivilized arrogant fucks that somehow slid in, I have a speech for you. Yes, this is regarding the recent Engineer postings, the previous Sauder’s postings, and everyone else who are always constantly judging you about absolutely anything you do/study. Why are you trying to prove that your faculty is the smartest of them all? We know that engineering is stressful, we know you guys have a shortage in females, and we know for a fact that the work isn’t easy. But……so? What is your point? You chose your own path, you like what you do and if you didn’t that’s still your own choice. What makes you think that you can step down on an entire faculty based on your own study? The greatest stories in history wouldn’t exist if Shakespeare studied Engineering instead. Mona Lisa wouldn’t be painted if Leonardo da Vinci studied Business, and I wouldn’t be able to write this right now if Bill Gates studied Psychology.
Everyone can agree that Bill Gates is smart, but would he able to paint the Mona Lisa or write MacBeth? Birds can fly really fast but can they swim? Fishes can swim fast too but can they run? Everyone is born with different strengths and weaknesses, and views everything in a different way. I believe, that is the reason for the existence of the many different Faculties, to provide a place to enhance on each individual’s passion. So what gives you the right to look down and judge on what other people are doing? If you must rank your level of intelligence, compare it with the other birds because I know you’ll just drown in my water. And honestly, if you think your so smart why don’t you just transfer to Harvard, why are you even here? If you “really” did study a B.A in “Arts”, and are doing another undergrad in Engineering, came out thinking Arts was super easy in comparison, I applaud you for having strengths in two different areas, that is really amazing. But again, unless you skipped some years, I’d assume that you’re hitting thirty and um… don’t you have a life to get together rather than releasing your stress on here?
Sincerely, a student that could never proudly answer the question of “What Faculty are you in?” due to the amount of fake enthusiastic responses received. I am proud to be in UBC, and I should be proud to represent my faculty as well.
P.S Correct me all you want because I know my grammar sucks, but I’m decent in math so yea","#5385

I'm doing my second degree, which isn't so bad, except it's my second UNDERGRADUATE degree. Yep, that's right, I basically spent my whole life in school.
And you know what? Best choice ever. And, I really have to be honest about it: as someone who has taken a full BA in Arts courses, and now a B.Apsc in Engineering: Arts is easy as shit. Like, pathetically easy. I'm really not joking. Most of my undergrad was spent smoking weed, drinking, and going to parties, and working a couple hours a day to do readings and papers. I had a 3.85/4 CGPA in Arts. My GPA in Engineering isn't nearly as good, around 3.4, and I literally bust my ass all day every day, and weekends too.
Also, when you take an Arts course and think, ""hmm, this all seems pretty intuitive and straightforward"" its a good sign you shouldn't be paying for it. Spend your money learning difficult things (whatever that might be for you), and save the genuinely interesting / comes naturally stuff for your own free time.","#5355

Fast forward a few weeks. I need to see a doctor because of sports related injury and am told that they're all booked until April. Not meaning to bitch about it but what the hell?

Until recently, they started mass produce all these generic songs that just aren't good enough anymore 😢
Sorry but I really didn't like Paris, New York City was MUCH BETTER.

TRIGGER WARNING: Groping, Pedophilia
When I was in 6th grade, I was groped by a stranger in his mid-to-late twenties in the elevator of the apartment complex my family was living in at the time. I was on my way to school and when the elevator stopped on the 4th floor and he got on. He didn't seem recognizable, nor did I care. Once the doors shut I realized he was standing far too close to me when there was so room in the elevator (we were the only two riding it at the time). Then, without any warning his hands moved up and started feeling and squeezing my breasts tightly. I was horrified and knew that what he was doing was wrong, but I didn't say anything out of the fear he'd do something worse. The ride down to the ground floor was a few seconds long, but it felt like an eternity. Once we reached the ground floor he bolted out the elevator, and I just stood there feeling disgusted with myself and my body. I told my mom about it once I got home from school, and like any good mother would she told me it wasn't my fault, talked to the security guards in our building about the incident, and had them go over the security tape to see if anyone could recognize the man. No one did. Because of that, a police report was never filed (nor would it have done any good to begin with as I lived in a South Asian country that never took incidents like this seriously).
It's been 11 years since, and genuinely thought I'd moved past the incident as I rarely even think about it. However, I saw him again in my dreams last night. We were standing in that same elevator in that same corner, and I saw him grin as he made me feel violated all over again. And even then I couldn't do anything. I was silent, yet again. I'd woken up from that dream hours ago, but I still feel absolutely l disgusted with both my body and myself and am on the verge of tears as I'm typing this. It's like I reliving the situation and the aftermath all over again. Fuck, I have class in an hour and a paper due at midnight I can't be dealing with this stupid dream right now.","#5167

Sorry in advance for the lengthy post, but just really needed to get this message across. I was made aware of the illegal intern cover-ups by 720 Sweets awhile ago through UBC confessions. Personally, I have a lot of problems with this company. I was an avid customer of 720 Sweets when they first opened and was a humble/homey local business. They hired many UBC students and some high school students. Few of my friends went on to work for 720 Sweets, they were the OG employees (started working there when the place just opened up). When the business started getting all the hype and was ""booming"", a friend of mine working there was promised sort of a manager-in-training position (they don't have official positions for their employees). But soon after, the owners hired a new batch of employees and quickly promoted one of the new people for the position, thus the promotion my friend was promised was promptly dropped. The reason they gave my friend was that ""the office is based in richmond, and would be too far of a commute"" for my friend, WTF? My friend quit the job right then and there and cut all ties with the business. Now this happened awhile ago, but what I really want to shine a light on is the false pretenses that 720 Sweets seems to operate on through their very egotistic owner. I was on Youtube and was recommended a channel that belongs to non other than (one of the) owner(s), Wilson K Lee. Just a quick skim of his more recent videos, he states ""we find premium ingredients that go with the combo so that our customers would find good value in the product."" Hold up, PREMIUM ingredients? They use store bought POWDER ice cream mix for their PREMIUM ice cream flavors. I understand businesses wanting to save a few bucks on costs but don't bluff about using ""premium"" ingredients when you're buying unknown branded pre-made mixes. Premium ingredients would be what Earnest and Bella Gelateria uses NOT what 720 Sweets uses. Their ""toppings""? Also not premium, and often off-brand ingredients purchased from dollar stores. And what ""good value"" is he talking about? They charge above-average for a cup of at best mediocre ice cream (it was way better before they became a sell-out). I'm definitely not one to critique but merely wanting to expose a shady business when I see one. The owner Wilson K Lee seems to be very proud of his ""achievements"" and often boasts on social media about his alleged success. On his Youtube channel he teaches people how to be successful just like him. LMAO WHAT. What do you have to teach???? Please stop exploiting students and lying to your customers.

I still swiped right. There's a tiny part of me that's hoping that this entire situation, as fucked up as it is, turns out like that piña colada song. Not because I believe in love and forgiveness - I just fucking love that song.

I’m getting tired too of the irresponsible bikers on campus. I writing this long post to vent my frustrations because I’ve been hit twice in the last month.
First thing first, we pedestrians have responsibilities too. We are sharing the space, so we should always be aware of our surroundings. Don’t walk while texting on the phone, don’t walk on zig zag and take your headphones off so you can hear the sounds around you.
But bikers, being the ones that can cause injuries, have a bigger responsibility. There are many bikers who are courteous enough to dismount when the amount of people in the road is too high. Many of them will ride at a snail peace in such situations. These people are great and they are not the ones I am directing this post to. My problem is with the irresponsible jerks who fly past pedestrians. There are even ones who say they get a “rush” when they scare pedestrians by riding at high speeds right next to them. Anyone with this mentality is a complete ashhole and should not be allowed to bike on campus. It makes my blood boil just to think of it, imagine a car driver who thinks like this, they would not be able to keep their license for more than a month.
Here are some details of the last two times I was hit by a bike:
First one, I’m walking at rush hour on Main Mall. I’m walking next to the grass, and paying attention to my surroundings. I am aware of several bikers sharing the road with me. But there are things I don’t expect. If I’m walking next to the grass, I can have the reasonable expectation that there won’t be on a high speed biker coming from that side. But that is exactly what happened. Someone decide that biking on the grass was a great way of avoiding pedestrian traffic, and did not bait an eye before trying to rejoin the road without decreasing their speed. I saw this person when they were a few meters from me, and, because I was not expecting that, I stopped. This threw off the biker, who crashed on me. I’m aware that if I had just kept walking the biker may have avoided me, but it is kind of scary see a big mass at high speed coming right to you at high speed so panicking and stopping was a natural reaction. So if you bike on the grass (which you shouldn't be doing in the first place), be very careful when you rejoin the road. People are not expecting you in that situation.
In the second one, I was walking on the sidewalk on West Mall, in front of Marine Drive Residence. You may recognize that this is a street, which bikers can perfectly use. Yet, some of them still decide to bike on the sidewalk, as is the case of the one that hit me. I was walking at my own peace, when I saw a squirrel doing something funny, so I stop to take a video. And at that moment a biker that was coming fast behind me hit me. This biker had the audacity of trying to blame it on me because I stopped without a warning. Well, of course I did, I am in the sidewalk and there is a street right there they should be using instead. It would be ironic if they don’t use the street because they are afraid to share it with cars, but don’t have the courtesy to consider that pedestrians may be afraid to share the sidewalk with them.","#5067

Dear UBC Housing,
Please create a better roommate allocation system. My roommate and I are nothing alike. He is super obnoxious and very uncleanly. Other schools have systems that ask you a variety of different questions in order to pair you with someone similar to yourself. Please consider creating a system like this in order to avoid horrible roommate matches and weird living situations.

Ever since someone made the confession that they used binoculars to watch people having sex in their car at the top of north parkade, I have noticed an increasing trend in this occurrence. I also happen to have a good view of the top level of the parkade and I don't even need binoculars to see what they are doing. It has begun to happen about one in every 3 days. I am guessing this confession started some sort of allure to sex at the top of the parkade, because it happened extremely rarely before. Yesterday I saw two different cars parked on opposite sides of the parking lot both doing the same thing. A few days before that there was a car with at least 3 people in it, maybe more, also having a good time. I am kind of surprised how sexually adventurous UBC students are, or how a select few are. I am thinking of investing into a pair of binoculars so that I will have good enough of a view to jerk off to.","#4855

All in all I look like a very ordinary and able bodied young male. There have been countless times where I have asked fellow students to sit in their priority seat and they have said no. I don't want to have to tell everyone I ever encounter on the bus I have MS, I really just wish people would assume you have a mobility issues even if there aren't any visible signs of it. On the flip side there has also been plenty of times where I have been sitting in priority seating and another person with problems asked to take my seat and I have to say no. I get tons of dirty looks from people sitting around me, especially other able bodied students who didn't get up in the first place before they were forced to ask. I have had someone verbally berate me for not giving my seat up to an elderly man, and in this instance I told him that I did had MS and he was completely embarrassed in front of his wife and the other passengers. It was nice to see the look of guilt on his face.","#4822

Before coming to UBC, I spent a couple of years working in the military. One thing I really wasn't prepared for before coming here was the amount of resentment & hostility I would receive from the community:
-An admissions councilor told me to seriously consider trade school because ""University requires critical thinking and mental discipline. I don't think someone with your background and experience will find it manageable here.""
-At the Gallery, someone wearing Greek letters threw a drink in my face and called me a ""fucking babykiller"" when I was chatting with a friend in a circle of acquaintances and the topic of where we had worked came up.
-An RA told me to take down a photo on my wall (It's not like we were aggressively posturing with weapons in the photo - it was just a picture of a friend and I in our field uniforms standing in front of a non-combat vehicle) because it ""would make other residents feel uncomfortable.""
-I've had more than one career student services adviser recommend I replace ""Military"" with ""Public/Government Sector"" on my resume because it may create ""culture fit"" issues when trying to get a job or volunteer position on campus.
I'm honestly not angry, just surprised. In fact, I consider myself incredibly well-adjusted and happy to have found a supportive group of friends that accept me for who I am. It just really fucking hurts when you realize that a community like UBC that exhorts diversity and being true to yourself in practice would prefer you to cover up and hide the part of your personal history that has been a formative part of your self-identity.","#4814

I live in totem park and I did some laundry today and put in a load with my fitted sheet and two towels, by no means a full load. I put it in the dryer on high heat, paid for the cycle, and put another load in the washing machine. When I went to pull my sheets/towels out of the dryer and put the other load in I noticed that everything in the dryer was still extremely damp so I had to leave my washing and pay for another round in the dryer for the same load. This happens all the time and I have such an issue with the fact that I pay for something that doesn't even get the job done properly. Don't suppose anyone knows who someone could talk to about maybe getting a drying machine that actually works? Sorry for the extremely first world problem-y rant","#4674

I thought first years may have been complaining a little bit more than necessary about the conditions of their dining halls, having lived in Vanier last year. Today I bought a salad, just a salad. After paying, I decided to ask for a receipt to see if there really is any funny business going on.
The cashier had charged me not just for a salad, but a grilled chicken breast? I was pretty shocked. The manager was able to refund the money, but seriously, what if I didn't ask for a receipt?
An easy solution is to have the cash register display what the cashier is adding to your order. If Orchard is trying to be so high tech and futuristic, this shouldn't be a problem, I would imagine.","#4594

People think I'm too cocky and what not but what I can't explain to them is that THIS is what drives me and makes me happy. The reason I work my ass off to get on that Dean's list or pursue that super selective internship opportunity or spend a lot of time networking on LinkedIn and various events is so I can accomplish things that (my loved ones and) I can proudly talk about. If I take that away, I won't do half as well or be half as happy. If I decide to stop 'showing off', I won't have anything driving me - that's just the sort of person I am.
For some reason, people around me always call me a 'show off' and look down on me (discrediting the hard work I put in to be able to 'show off'). I really don't get why; I only show off stuff I worked hard to earn - is that really such a horrible thing to do?","#4463

I'M SO FED UP WITH UBC PARKING. You spend literally 20 minutes trying to find a spot because there's either no space or pricks like this individual take up 1.5 parking spots. I don't want to constantly spend 10 minutes trying to fit into a spot because you can't park between 2 goddamn lines (this has happened to me multiple times so this time I decided to leave a passive aggressive note... no regrets). Parking costs a fortune, even compared to the Easy Park prices Downtown. The damn speed bumps are more effective at damaging your car than slowing you down. After 2 years of commuting by transit I thought I'd give driving a try this year but honestly I'd rather take the bus and skytrain for 90 min rather than dealing with this shit.","#4459

I'm only a few courses away from graduating, but in order to do so I have to take 6 courses this term. Most of them are pretty intensive courses that I need for my degree and only two are ""electives""... which still require a lot of work. I've worked really hard to recover my GPA from first year (classic) and I've done a pretty good job. I'm proud of how hard I've worked because it has NOT been easy.
However, something has changed this term. I feel totally overwhelmed and because of this I keep procrastinating my work, which makes me feel worse, so I procrastinate again, and I feel worse, and so on and so forth. I feel like I'm digging myself into a pit. I'm pretty sure it's because of my courseload, but I can't drop any courses now and I still really want to graduate soon.
I know this is long, so I'll cut to the chase: does anyone have any advice? Has anyone been in a similar situation? I've been thinking of going to a counselor to get some tips on time and stress management, but again I just keep putting it off. I don't even enjoy the things I do when I'm procrastinating... I just feel disgusted with myself that I'm being lazy and letting myself fall behind.
tl;dr: I'm a piece of shit and can't force myself to focus. I'm afraid my progress and grades are going to spiral down. I need advice!","#4450

So my boyfriend got these noise cancelling headphones recently. They're probably the worst thing to exist in our relationship.
Sometimes when we study in a group with friends he'll have them on. I'll try to call his name to get his attention, but he'll be so busy jamming out to music that he won't be able to hear me. Then he realizes I'm talking, but having to repeat myself over and over can be frustrating.
So what I do now is talk about other boys with my friends when he has his headphones on to get his attention. Tbh I don't know if he can hear us. Maybe one day he'll realize how detrimental these headphones can be.
Note to bae: dw the other boys dont really matter. But gotta get your attention somehow.

I am appalled at the insanely low standards UBC has for recreation. Aside from the new aquatic center, we have a complete lack of fitness amenities on campus. Birdcoop is over 60 years old and is open fewer hours this semester than last semester (making overcrowding even worse). Open gym times at SRC are almost non-existant and are overcrowded in the few hours they are open. How can we be so committed to sustainability and mental health when we don't give people the tools to be well physically? Compare UBC's situation to other institutions like UCalgary, Western, Queen's, UAlberta and U of T. All these campuses have adequate fitness capacity to support their students. Where does our tuition increase money go?","#4331

Honestly I don't see the problem with her borrowing an aspect of another culture. What I do see a problem with was that the black girl was wearing tribal patterned leggings. That would also be cultural appropriation- are you native? no. Can we then say that you can't use aspects of other people's cultures? Then you also wouldn't be able to get henna done unless you were Indian, eat dim sum unless you're Chinese, etc etc etc. TL;DR hypocritical girl gets angry and bystander gets triggered.","#4185

To the person who sleeps on the other side of the wall of me, I'm sorry if I kept you up. Last night was intense and it was a once in a lifetime experience. I sincerely apologize if my nervous screams of fright as well as elation kept you up at 3:00 in the morning and if the grunting didn't help . There were some ups and downs and lot of tension built up throughout, and some people make strange noises when they're exerting a lot of energy. You see . . .
My boy ROGER FEDERER WON his 18th mother fucking Grand Slam title and after years of heartbreak in many close finals, he finally defeats his greatest rival: Rafael Nadal. I'm sure you understand now that I was a witness to history in the making.

Your tennis loving neighbour

I'm a straight guy and suck at showing physical affection for people cuz i grew up here with a douche bro that made homophobic remarks if I showed any compassion to other guys (when you grow up like that, it essentially makes you implicitly feel that it's somehow not okay to show any affection for people without it being sexual). I always see people and they look sad and from my cultural background it would usually be okay to just spontaneously give people hugs/ that sort of affection but over here idek, people are lonely and depressed and I always feel a natural tendency to resist my urges to make them feel better through the way that makes me feel better (getting long hugs and that sorta love) except in really obvious situations (I'd only give hugs if you're crying or are in a lot of distress). I feel like its not just my douche bro tho, guys here have similar tendencies and they're almost always miserable and horny (from the lack of love and physical contact with people in general). Anyways, moral is, y'all are missing out on a HUGE stress reliever that you wouldn't know existed cuz y'all suck at showing real love and instead, waste your time isolated from people jerking off and doing whatnot, making yourself even more depressed and isolated.
No not everyone here is like this obviously but it's kinda clear that there isn't that huge community sense here and I think that's something that makes people more depressed in general.
TL:DR; everyone should show some love, hug people spontaneously, be more comfortable with each other (not in a sexual way but just in a healthy family feeling way)","#3987

Just wanted to get this off my chest... but for as long as I've ever considered going to UBC, I was always given shit by the people around me that having an ""Arts"" degree is equivalent to having nothing.
So in high school, I had the natural perception to go apply for Science or Commerce, needless to say I ended up within my second choice Arts. I'm in my second year now in Arts, and still at times get shit on for having an Arts degree by my friends within Commerce or Science.
So I was like fuck them, I'm going to be more involved with my faculty this year. I ended up meeting some bomb ass people within the faculty of Arts, but then I realized no matter how hard I try to immerse myself within my faculty, I just can't seem to find that passion for what I'm studying and for my faculty itself. I tend to deviate towards business clubs/events more often than I see myself attending any clubs within Arts. I'm not bashing the prestige of having an Arts degree or any of the clubs, but personally, for myself, it feels as if I'm wasting my time studying something that just doesn't interest me.
I considered transferring but thought to myself that my grades simply aren't high enough for acceptance into a faculty like Commerce for instance. So I've come to somewhat accept the fact that maybe I'm not cut out for any other faculty. But then this kind of dilemma would always resurface when I tell people that I'm in Arts whereas they're in Commerce or Science. I would feel sour, that I'm in Arts and not up to the standards of a student in Commerce / Science.
TLDR; I guess what I'm really looking for is advice, is it worth staying in Arts doing something you don't love, or trying to transfer even though the chances are slim.","#3976

I'm all for people having good fun, drinking if they want to drink, and living life the way they want to. However imo the normalisation of alcohol culture is incredibly dangerous. A lot of people drink and party (and I do too), but I think we should simultaneously be aware that alcohol can be a huge problem for people. For everyone joking about alcoholism, there really should be recognition that alcoholism can be a life altering and terrible problem to deal with, and that we need to take people seriously when they say they don't want to drink or aren't comfortable with people drinking, and to not pressure them into doing so. And there needs to be some respect and understanding towards people who don't want to drink for any number of reasons; past history with it, current problems with it, or having family members or themselves be affected badly by it in the past - or just because they don't want to. Also, with a huge drinking culture in uni it's hard to be self aware and recognize when you're starting to have an alcohol problem too, and that's why I think we should be allowed to have fun but also be conscious of all this as well. If you do think you have a problem it's not shameful to try and get help for it. And I think it'll be really nice to people if we consider their relation with alcohol when we're constantly only creating alcohol-fueled socialisation environments, and consider that there are people who genuinely aren't okay with alcohol, even if they don't feel comfortable speaking up about it.","#3964

Shoutout to all the people who are enablers in friend groups. You know, the person who brings people together because they are willing to make the first move to plan something.
The enablers are always under-appreciated. I often hear people complain that they haven't hung out with a group of friends for a long time, and that's because no one makes the first move to initiate the hang out. People from my friend group have told me that they're so glad to be friends with me because they meet more people. Several of my friends have become couples because I've introduced them to each other, but unless I initiate something, no one ever wants to hang out. Yet they are so grateful when I do it--to a point where I feel like I've been taken for granted.
Once I invited four of my friends who didn't know each other at all to something, and now they are really great friends. Which is good and I am happy for them, but it hurts that they have an entire group chat without me and plans events never inviting me. So, I want to give a special shoutout to all the 'enablers' in friend groups out there. You make everything way more fun and you really bring people together. If you ever feel under appreciated, never dull your energy, I feel you and appreciate you.","Dear Thunderbirds,

I just want to start by saying I'm in love/deep like with you, I know we only met on the bus whilst you were going to residence and we had our 20 minute random conversation, but I was so nervous to talk/approach you that night and I'm glad I DID.
It was a first for me to see a perfect stranger and just approach a girl and just tell her what I think of her and then just talk about her and who she is on the bus. That night I was NOT suppose to end up at the UBC bus loop, I passed my destination just so I can converse a little more before I went home that evening. I was discouraged a little bit when you mentioned your bf in the conversation but I really looked passed that and just admired many things about you, your eyes, your smile and just your whole personality. So at the the bus loop when we all had to get off i knew you were going to be occupied with dinner and study; but I built up the courage inside me to ask for your facebook and thankfully! you gave it to me, and I proceeded to add you, but I haven't heard or got a reply to the friend request? I figure you were busy with study; but as weeks passed by I checked to see if you accepted my request? but still no response, until a month later I finally checked your page to see that the friend request was ignored or declined because the request button was opened up again, maybe i should have sent a message or not.
I'm guessing you and your bf are working things out now and I'm happy for you and hope you are in good health and feeling well. Maybe I should of messaged you with a follow up to our bus convo? but really I did not want to intrude on your already given relationship status, therefore I did not message you on your facebook, I just let it be whatever it was on the bus between us as; friendly and polite strangers. I'm thankful I acted on my feelings and talked to you on the bus and am appreciative that you responded in kind. I just want you to know I wish you were single otherwise I would of contacted you more READILY after our bus ride. You probably thought It was some random event and dismissed me after weeks of no contact? but honestly I had so many things on my mind that month and I did not want to follow up on our brief encounter unless I was confident enough to deserve you <3. I really like you and I hope you see this. Take care stranger and hope you have a good 2017. I wish we met each other at a better time in our lives but better this moment then never :)","#3369

I'm a straight guy and I sometimes feel like cuddling (non sexually) with another guy if I liked him emotionally and felt he was trustworthy. Also, I feel like this sort of thing can only be done while I'm young and single. With a girl, it might get sexual (I'm decently attractive) but with a guy (who's straight) it would be a stress reliever? I believe I just don't get enough physical affection (like long hugs) from guys... OH and i don't have daddy issues so it's not that either LOL. Anyways people! Give other people LOTS of hugs spontaneously (or just ask them if you can give them a hug)! hahaha","#3367

It's hard to be in America after the Trump election. My Muslim friends are scared they'll have to leave the country. My Mexican friends are scared for their less fortunate relatives who are only here on expired visas. My gay little brother is scared that his rights will get stripped before he even gets a chance to publicly come out. And I'm scared for all the women who won't get proper health education from their school, and know nothing of protection or safe practices because they didn't think to or weren't able to visit a Planned Parenthood.
We are scared. If you voted for Trump, don't stick your head in the sand and ignore these communities. If you aren't racist, help these communities. Volunteer. Be a friend.
In the end, the politics don't matter. If you actively try to stop the bad your candidate has brought in, I won't even hold your vote against you. Just please help these hurting communities, especially if it was an unintended consequence of your vote.
I just want my loved ones to feel safe.","#3365

I feel with the rise in social media and internet dating I feel as though men don't approach women anymore nor are women as receptive towards attempts made by men to ask them out. Do men still approach women to simply ask them to take them out for dinner? And ladies, how does it make you feel when a guy does that and is there any way a random guy can do this without appearing creepy or fall under the ubiquitous clichés of a guy simply trying to get numbers?
Ps: I like how you guys added the help lines and emergency lines and such. The confession page in my city is ruthless and I think people genuinely got suicidal from it. There were lots of suicides lately. It's fucked.","#3356

I was feeling down this whole summer (possibly depressed, I don't know) because of various factors that I will not go into detail for this confession.
I remember deciding earlier on that I should probably seek help from the various resources provided by UBC, so I decided to book appointments to see advisors to see what I could do instead of just being sad all day in my room, getting panic attacks and whatnot. I visited UBC Counselling, Career Advising at Brock Hall and the Science Information Centre for Science Advising.
My most vivid memories from this series of counselling include:
1. Getting judged unfairly by an advisor/therapist at UBC Counselling, who in turn thought I was trying to get sympathy from authorities to help withdraw me from a course past the withdrawal deadline instead of just trying to help me out mentally when I sought it.
2. Getting openly asked by the front desk lady at the Science Information Centre to openly declare a 'legitimate'/'important' reason for seeing an advisor in an open room with other people e.g. mental health issues. I remember taking a few seconds to just process the absurdity and eventually mustered up the courage to frustratingly say that I was having mental health issues in front of everybody. I found this extremely unprofessional and felt that the lady did not respect my privacy (especially with another staff member right next to us and other students waiting in line in close proximity) and felt that I needed an outlandish reason just to see a science advisor.
3. Meeting a career advisor who acknowledged that I was feeling helpless and unmotivated but decided to help me out and plan out schedules that weren't too demanding but helped with fixing my sleep schedule and getting me to do productive things instead of staying in bed gaming all day. Thanks, Angela - You aren't working there anymore but I really do appreciate the e-mail of concern you sent me after the time I couldn't make it to the appointment when I got a sudden session of panic attacks, causing me to curl up, cry and fall asleep in my bed.
Anyway, that's all I have to say. Thanks again to those who helped me out when I needed it the most :)
Happy holidays!","#3345

When I was first year there was a final exam for one of them arts courses. The professor provided us with 8 long answer questions beforehand and told us 3 of them are going to appear on the exam. Obviously most people wouldn't take chances and answer all 8 beforehand to prepare for the exam. Being the scheming douchebag I am, I contacted people in that class and told them we will trade answers to divide the work which they happily agreed. I told one person I would give him question number 1 if he give me number 2, while at the same time telling another person I will give him question number 2 if he gave me number 1. I did this for all 8 questions and so in the end I got answers for all of them with no work on my part whatsoever while the others painstakingly read all the textbook readings and slides.

I don't know where to start. I'm an international student and I get that I made a commitment to pay insane amounts of cash, but sometimes I feel that UBC would give us a little more respect than creating new avenues to take money from us. In terms of a lot of opportunities it already feels like I don't have human rights if I'm not Canadian (I have a few specific examples that come to mind, such as not getting paid for a job someone from here would be paid for). I'm also not from a very rich family unlike most internationals that come here. I have a merit based scholarship from international agencies that barely keep me alive. There have been times when I was homeless, and times when I've starved whilst working on my studies became the norm and not the exceptions. I wish I could go back home. But I can't. This is all so I can have a better life .There's a civil war/volatile situation back home which prevents even the little money I do get from getting to me at times...so I'd keep myself alive on sugar water and eggs and cup noodles. Nobody around me knows what I'm going through because I haven't told them, and sometimes I hit breaking point. I have grades far above average but sometimes I wonder if this is all worth it. The other day a woman downtown snapped at me calling me a f**** economic migrant when I told her I didn't have enough money to buy her a subway sandwich.

As a fourth year student skimming over all these confessions, I have only one advice for all of you: jerk off. Are you feeling lonely? Jerk off. Do you feel ugly and feel undervalued by your new UBC friends? Jerk off. Are you too shy to ask that boy/girl out? Jerk off. There are several reasons for this. Not only does it keep you happy(#1 tool against depression) by satisfying your sexual needs but it makes your brain feel satisfied. After a while, you'll also become more attractive cuz trust me people are much nicer and much more open when they realize you hold the knowledge of the best sex positions in bed. You will get that number when you say I have a 12 inch…. So find good porn websites my bruhs and sis. (lol sorry 3295 op i just can't...)","#3334

After a while, you'll also become more attractive cuz trust me people are much nicer and much more open when they realize you hold the knowledge of the best sex positions in bed. You will get that number when you say I have a 12 inch…. So find good porn websites my bruhs and sis.

On the day of the first chem 121 quiz with Therrien, I sat down and saved some seats for my friends. a girl who looked like she was by herself, came and asked if the seats beside me were taken, I said yes. she said that's okay and then she ended up sitting a row behind me because those seats were completely taken yet. my friends came and sat down. the prof came and started handing out the quiz. me and my friends started to freak cus we had nothing to write with. the girl who asked to sit in the seats around me tapped my friends shoulder and gave each of us a pen to use. the moment I turned around to take a pen from her hand, I looked at her, and man she had the prettiest eyes ive ever seen. idek why but that made me think about her the whole day, and the day after that. at the next lecture.
I saw her walk in by herself again, so I waved to her and told her to sit with me and my friends, but before I could even signal her to come she noticed her friends and sat with them. from that day on, she always sat on the other side of the lecture hall with her friends. I never had the chance to sit next to her or talk to her. I don't have her on any social media but luckily I got to see her a lot by coincidence and I try to stop and talk but she always just waves and smiles. shes always has somewhere to go. i also saw her in line at mercante, she was next in line, i was a couple spots back. the person infront of her didn't have enough money, and i saw her go up to the cashier and hand an extra 5$ bill. i didn't really hear what the person said to the girl but the girl said no to the person who didn't have enough money and then turned to the cashier again to place her order, handing a 20 to the cashier. the couple in front of me said ""oh that was nice of her, to pay for the difference for a stranger."" another time, I saw her eating lunch with a guy. it was just her and that guy, one on one. my heart just sank.
I just want her to know that she is cute af and i'd do anything to have a decent conversation with her and get to know her better cus she obviously has a heart of gold. I see her at the coop sometimes working out with her friends, and yes she is still cute af even in a light blue Adidas shirt and navy shorts. it just hurts to see that it looks like shes having a the time of her life while I'm here still feeling like I need her to notice me for me to have the time of my life.
i didn't have the guts to confess to her and now I just lost her for good. and man I regret it so fcking much I actually hate myself for it","#3333

Earlier this semester, I had been hanging out with this guy a lot and couldn't deny anymore that I was really into him (I'm a girl) and I thought it might be mutual. It took me three days to get out the words to ask him out, but I did it and we started dating. He's my boyfriend now, and we're so happy being together. I feel like it's still considered weird for girls to ask guys out because everyone has been surprised that I was the one who asked him out. So if you're a girl considering asking a guy out, go for it! People will have a surprising amount of respect for you and it can work out really well :)","#3332

I've heard stories of some people finishing courses with exceptionally high marks in the high 80's - 90's and I can't fathom how they do it. I'm in 2nd year Sciences and my marks are really average, like within the range of 60 - 80. I haven't been able to get a final mark above an 80 in anything and it's so frustrating because I feel like I'm already working so hard. My life is basically geared completely towards school now. If there would ever a time where I were to allow myself to get a chance to relax or go out briefly, I feel as if I could actually wind up failing.
Even when I feel like I've studied enough to the point where I truly understand the material, my exam marks typically fall within or very close to class averages. Regardless of knowing that I am doing okay in comparison to everyone else, I want to be able to go above and beyond. But at this point, I really doubt that it's possible for me.","#3325

No, but seriously. I recently broke up with my boyfriend and I'm sometimes down but it's for the best! We are staying good friends, trying not to stress, and I can focus more on school, family, and friends. Sometimes, change of perspective is all you need.

Do you feel ugly and feel undervalued by your new UBC friends? Dine out. Are you too shy to ask that boy/girl out? Dine out. There are several reasons for this. Not only does it keep you happy(#1 tool against depression) by satisfying your tastebuds and stomach, it also builds up a knowledge base about food in your brain. After a while, you'll also become more attractive cuz trust me people are much nicer and much more open when they realize you hold the knowledge of where to find all these amazing dishes that they have never heard of. You will get that number when you say hey I know a great dimsum place…. So find good food my bruhs and sis (or learn to cook or open a restaurant or whatever float your boat).

To be honest, inside of me I knew I would do really bad but I didn't know it was possible for me to fail the whole semester. I haven't even told my parents yet and I'm not sure how to break the news. I worked really hard actually and especially hard for Chem 233 so I am really disappointed in myself and I realized how dumb I am. This is actually so embarrassing and now I am on academic probation. Right now I just want to quit school and give up because I am mentally hurt and I want to cry so much but I can't because I don't want my parents to hear me crying.

As a fourth year student skimming over all these confessions, I have only one advice for all of you: work out. Are you feeling lonely? Work out. Do you feel ugly and feel undervalued by your new UBC friends? Work out. Are you too shy to ask that boy/girl out? Work out. There are several reasons for this. Not only does it keep you sane(#1 tool against depression) by releasing endorphins, it also builds up confidence in yourself. After a while, you'll also become more attractive and trust me people are much nicer and much more open when you're hot. You will get that number when you walk up and say hi. So lift my bruhs and sis (or run or do yoga or whatever exercise float your boat).","#3295

Okay I'll admit I'm lonely. It sucks liking someone that you know won't like you back. Normally I don't care too much, but when most of yours friends are dating/have dated/finding a SO, and others are making fun of you for not dating yet, it gets to you. Especially with my feed full of couple photos now since it's Christmas...
I've been feeling depressed lately also because of not only this, but because I feel isolated from my friends because they all seem so much closer than I am to any of them, despite me trying my hardest. I'm always afraid I'll end up being pushed aside. I was never good at making CLOSE friends, and I really don't wanna lose the ones I've made now.
Not much else to say; sort and sweet. This is for confessions, right? I confess I feel alone. I confess I feel depressed. Maybe admitted it like this will help me get better. Happy Holidays I guess to everyone else. Merry Christmas! :)","#3293

Lee, Peter Wall. In fact, Robert H.Lee established the UBC Property Fund and made over $600 million dollars for UBC by flipping houses. Real estate is literally everything, Ryan Beedie builds condos and sells it to rich Chinese people, and Beedie School of Business is named after him. Asia's richest man makes most of his money through real estate. Of course, US President-elect mainly makes money through real estate.

I've been sleeping around for the past year and a half. The first person I ever had sex with, which was last spring, gave me an STI. When we broke up I went on a sexual rampage. Not because of the STI, but because I was in a bad emotional state, and had a lot going on in my life. To date, I have slept with twelve people, most have had overlap, and four were one or two-time deals. I had sex dressed up as a male character on Halloween, sex on a mountain, and lots of car sex. I don't regret any of it. Since the summer and up until recently, I have been in a ""relationship"" with three different people at the same time. One of them broke up with me because he wanted something a bit more serious than just seeing me once a week or so, and I couldn't feasibly date three people and do well in school (which is my ultimate priority), so I was unable to compromise. The other two are very hard-working, busy men. They both don't want serious relationships right now, which is in line with my current state as well. We haven't talked about exclusivity in depth, and if we do, I intend to be honest about it. Two of the twelve have given me Chlamydia, so I have had a 16.6% Chlamydia rate. I don't use protection normally but if he feels more comfortable doing so then I will. I don't think I've given Chlamydia to anyone but I've had numerous awkward conversations over the past year just to make sure they were alright and had gotten it checked out. I just got a check recently and found out that I am clean, meaning the three guys were also clean. I haven't told anyone the whole story of my sex life yet. I'm not ashamed of it at all, and I would do it over again. I just feel that maybe my friends can't handle all that information at once, because I can barely believe that I've done all that in under two years. If I have learned anything, it would be that one night stands are very fun, but also very self-destructive. I wouldn't recommend them. And the sex, although passionate and hot, didn't feel that great. I guess that's the moral of this confession. Skip the one night stands, finish all your antibiotics, and prioritize school.","#3278

Merry Christmas! This is certainly the time of year to spend with those you love. I understand some may be far from home and away in this distant cold land but at least give your family a video call as I am sure they would love to hear from you.
I’ll try to keep this short, but some stories can only be cut down so much. I am a student in my last few years of undergrad at UBC. I’ve been through the ups and downs of academic stress and have shrugged off failing grades. I spent a year rediscovering myself and planning out a new career trajectory. However, 2016, for me, was a rather brutal year. My mother passed away. Its nearly been a year, so I have been through many stages of grief; what happened happened and no amount of regret or depression will fill that void. I eventually found solace in striving to make her proud rather than regressing backwards. Therefore, this year it has been my first time getting an “A” average, and after years of applying, I finally received a UBC bursary.
The message I want to share with this story is a simple one. My mother did not pass away suddenly, but I feel that there is a generational or cultural disposition to believe that one’s parents are immortal. I spent months beating myself up due to the optimism that was provided me and I was led to believe I always had tomorrow to say goodbye. I’ve discussed this with many people and I’ve learnt that death (at least in the West) is a discussion forbidden at the dinner table. Mentally, emotionally, we know nothing of what to do once it knocks at the door. Therefore, I threw away the last months of my mother’s life due to the belief that “everything would be fine.” I spent time in school, travelling, and working on my own issues. My mother and I are incredibly close, but I, like many others, was too naïve to make the time we had left count.
So I want to spend this Christmas, my first Christmas without my mother, reminding you that life is incredibly ephemeral. Never take the present day for granted. It is always a good time to seek out those you love and tell them you love them. Do not wait for tomorrow because the future is often uncertain. The only thing that is certain is that now is a good time to make that call. Merry Christmas everyone!","#3276

I recently posted a confession to stealing UBC doorstops in response to the perverse convention of propping bathroom doors open. I figured at least a few people would agree with me, but instead in the comments I was labelled as a maniac, a vandal, and a criminal. How is it that others aren't disturbed by this repellent convention? The main argument seems to be that the door should be open for hygiene purposes. I guess, using a paper towel to open the door is deemed wasteful. But at what cost do we respect the environment? I mean, the ""green"" UBC soap dispensers rarely dispense soap, and now we have bathrooms just totally open to passerbys. For example, in the math building where I'm forced to spend most of my hours, one bathroom doesn't even have a door! Those that do, are of course opened, free for anyone walking by, or milling around in the halls to see and hear anything going on. You can literally see into the stalls. This induces an unimaginable rage within. Acts of extreme perversion must be met with an extreme reaction. This must be brought to an end.","#3269

I just found out my boyfriend of four years has been cheating on me emotionally. Over the past few months, he grew closer to one of his female friends I was aware of, but that he led me to believe he hardly spoke with since she moved to China temporarily. In reality, he started talking to her more and more, even calling her in the middle of the night due to the time difference (this led to him sleeping through our dates in the day time). He never once mentioned that he has been keeping in touch him with her since September (which was the last time I asked about her, and he said he rarely speaks with her). Meanwhile he has been growing distant from me, and I felt like he was neglecting our relationship. We hardly talked and he spent his days either studying or sleeping, claiming he was too busy to meet up.
The worst part though... when confronted he flat-out denied it was cheating. He wouldn't even show me enough to respect to admit my feelings were valid and let me be the victim. He only apologized for keeping his conversations with her a secret, but beyond that, he doesn't feel he did anything wrong. As a result, he's not exactly falling to his knees begging for forgiveness, or even offering to cut her out of his life. Hell, he's hardly even bothering to talk to me about it (we've been exchanging one email per day on this topic... where his are all full of excuses and denial. That's the extent of our communication). Since he won't accept that he cheated, he's not doing any of the things a guilty person would do. All he is offering is an apology for not telling me, because that's all he thinks is required of the situation.
I'm not surprised that he cheated and I'm not sorry this relationship is ending. We've been growing apart for some time and we're both better off separate. However, what I can't believe is that after four years he can't even show me enough decency to own up to his mistakes and accept responsibility. He is a coward who is too afraid to face the reality that he did something so awful so he's just denying it all. I also can't believe he is not bothering to try to salvage this situation at all. I can't believe he cares so little how this plays out. He hardly talks to me and nothing he says screams shame or regret or guilt. I deserve better than this. He either needs to admit that this counts as cheating and then break up with me for her, or admit he that this counts as cheating and try to earn my forgiveness. Right now he's just burying his head in the sand and hopes this all goes away.
He doesn't think this counts as cheating because he has ""no romantic feelings for her"". He doesn't understand that devoting more time to her than me and maintaining their relationship more than ours counts as emotional cheating. In fact, he also just flat-out denies that he's been neglecting me, as if that's up to him to decide. Am I actually wrong? Is this seriously okay? Am I overreacting? Is this cheating? He says the only problem in this situation is that he didn't tell me, but every other aspect of his relationship with her is innocent. Do I have the right to label him as a cheater in my mind? Do I have the right to be the victim?
By the way, our communication is excellent (at least on my end) so I have told him many times about how I feel that we're growing apart and all that. I have even told him that sometimes I suspect he might be cheating on me but he laughed it off. Also, he is allowed to have female friends as long as I know about their existence and he doesn't hang out alone in her bedroom or drink alone with her (pretty reasonable rules I'd say, and he doesn't even drink anyway). These rules go both ways. So he had no reason to be afraid of telling me that he's been keeping in touch. I wouldn't have minded and he knows this.","#3257

It is so frustrating when I see other people and their respectable degrees/career paths continuously being shamed. Has it ever occurred to people that what they are studying and trying to pursue is something they love and feel passionate about? Just because your not a business student, an engineer does not mean you are not a smart individual. It all depends what you consider 'smart' to be, and your perspective. Unfortunately, nothing will ever change this. In life we always put value/labels on every aspect. From race, gender, sexuality, education etc we always find a way to create hierarchies within these constructs.

A year ago, I was in a serious relationship with a guy in my [very small] program at UBC, and I was head over heels in love and happier than I'd ever been. Then, out of nowhere, 5 months into our relationship, he started becoming emotionally abusive. I was in tears almost every single day for weeks, and I started to become depressed. He then started cheating on me with another girl in our class (who was perfectly aware that he was in a serious relationship). I ended up breaking up with him because of the way he was treating me, even though I was still wholeheartedly in love with him. The months since then have been absolute hell. Due to the nature of our program, we are in all of the same classes, so I'm forced to face my ex and his new girlfriend every single day at school, and they don't make it easy for me. I started having anxiety every time I had to be in the same room as him, which seriously affected my ability to concentrate on lectures. To make matters worse, all of the close friends I had last year took my ex's side (?!) and pretty much abandoned me when I needed them the most. In the months since my breakup, none of them have responded to my messages or invitations to hang out or study together, or invited me to anything, and I'm inundated with photos of them having fun with my ex on social media. I'm not from BC, and school takes up so much of my time that I haven't been able to meet anyone outside of my program, so I've basically been completely alone for the past 10 months. I spend my weekends by myself in my apartment. I've tried making new friends, but my program is very cliquey and no one seems willing to let me into their friend group. I have no family on this side of the country. I've become severely depressed, and despite seeking medical attention and therapy, it has gotten to the point that every single day is a struggle to get through. I cry every day, and getting out of bed/doing my dishes/cleaning my apartment/going grocery shopping/cooking sometimes feel like impossible tasks. My grades have been affected, and I'm no longer the straight A student I once was. My life has completely fallen apart in the past year, and I'm heartbroken. I hate my life, and honestly, it doesn't feel worth living anymore. Why do people have to be so horrible? It didn't have to be this way.","#3237

I know a lot of people right now are struggling- especially first years. You may be getting your grades back and realizing you didn't do as well as you wanted or expected. You might feel hopeless and have regrets. You might think I didn't try hard enough, what if I did X, Y, or Z. You may have to tell your parents and you may be ashamed.
But I promise it will be okay. I was in your shoes last year. I failed two classes and barely passed some of my other classes. I knew I could have done better but I was struggling with adjusting to living in a new country, being away from my family and friends, an eating disorder, and I felt lost and hopeless. My academic performance also started to fall more as a result of being sexually assaulted in the middle of my first semester. I internalized everything and blamed myself.
I didn't get professional help, even though I would encourage others who are in a similar situation as I was to do the same. But I did talk to my friends, committed to having a healthier life with my diet and exercise, got involved in the community, talked to academic advisors about my options (I took some classes over the summer), and over the summer I got my life on track. I understand this might not be as easy for others as it was for me though.
My life definitely isn't perfect now, but academically I've improved a lot.
I have an 88 average this semester, I am in a program that I LOVE, I have opportunities to go abroad for research, I've built relationships with my professors and TA's, and if I keep it up I have some good prospects for grad school and my future.
So what I'm trying to say is that it gets better. Just because you fail doesn't mean you can't improve and do better. Take a lighter course load, reflect on the program you're in (I ended up switching to a different faculty after reflection and realizing my original life plan wouldn't make me happy), try building a routine, whether it's with exercise, joining a club, etc, and reach out for guidance from friends and family. It will be okay.","#3228

I think that we have come a long way with LGBTQ rights, but there's something that happens still happens to me that I want to confess.
Every once and while, I will meet someone new and during our introduction we will small talk and discuss interests. Not all the time, but frequently enough that I started to notice about 2 years ago, they will ask me ""So are you an actor? Do you do theater? Are you in performing arts?""
Don't get me wrong, it's not an insult. If anything it could be a compliment, since it means I have somewhat of a good voice and control over how I present myself. Here's the thing though.... I have never done a theater related thing ever in my life.
My point is that I'm a gay male, and there is a stereotype that gay people are interested in theater. I am aware that I sound gay. And I know that it's not an insult to be in theater. But this is a micro aggression. People seem disappointed, or simply in disbelief that I don't fit this stereotype and that is what gets me! What sparked this whole confession was that I had this happen (again) today and the man literally said ""What a waste"" in disgust :(
It is so frustrating when people assume your identity!!! At least I can be thankful that I don't have harsher stereotypes put on me, but to all those people out there who do I empathize with you.","#3217

It's really hard being shy sometimes. I'm in first year, and I've always been really shy. During my first semester at UBC, I've joined some clubs hoping I could meet new people and eventually break out of my shell, but it doesn't seem to be working. I'm still as shy as ever! Today, I just realized how much it sucks to be shy. Throughout the semester, I've ended up liking this boy, from my math class and tutorial, but I am too shy to approach him. Today (Dec 14), we had our math final, and thinking that I might never see him again really saddens me. I don't think I've ever liked anyone as much as him. I really wanted to talk to him today, but all I could do was stare (we do this all the time in class, lol). He's always with his friends, and every time I want to approach him, it's like I lose all the confidence I've built up whenever I see him, causing me to break eye contact :c Just wanted to get this off my mind. Hoping I will see him on campus sometime. Also, hope anyone who's reading this has a good winter break! :)","#3205

I think I'm developing anxiety over waiting for the bus. It seems that every time I wait, the bus never comes. I use the translink texting thing for the next bus, and it tells me it's coming in x minutes. X minutes after, it's still not here. I use the nextbus website and it tells me the bus is leaving now, while I stood there seeing no bus in sight. Finally a bus comes in the distance; while it approaches I see it saying ""sorry not in service"". There has been multiple occasions when I cried or almost cried for not catching the bus. I give myself enough time to wait for the bus yet it's constantly late. I hate it. I hate being late. There's another bus I could take, but it's not an express. So I always tell myself that the express will come and it will be faster. It doesn't seem like the case. The express makes me late. I know I can't count on the busses or blame the bus drivers. There's a huge problem with my mind. :(","#3203

The thought of going to a club for the first time gives me incredible anxiety. In lecture, you pretty much just sit for 50 minutes and leave. I basically leave my house to go to class, and go home.

The problem with having to commute everyday is that even though you get to meet a lot of new people & become friends with them you know you will never be able to be anything more than FRIENDS. I’m actually thankful for being a commuter because the majority of my uni friends and I met on the bus, but since we all commute from the same neighbourhood we are all connected one way or another. Everyone you meet already knows at least half of your friends and this usually ends up either working in your favour or against it. When it comes to boys it hasn’t really worked in my favour. For example, at the beginning of the year, I became friends with this guy, who I obviously commute with, and we really hit things off but as time went on I started to make more and more friends during our commute and the problem ended up being either he didn’t like my new friends or my new commuter friends didn’t like him (it primarily had to do with drama from when they were in high school). I believe this is mainly to blame to the fact that we live in a small community, since we have less than a handful of high schools in our area everyone knows each other and as a result there’s always drama, hatred, and jealousy that follows with it. TBH at first I thought it was this one guy who had this problem but after a semester of commuting i’ve realized that there’s no hope for me in finding ‘someone’ during my commute 😢","#3193

OK. Let's spread the butthurt to people outside of Arts too becoz why not. In reverse alphabetical order to save Arts for last.
Science - Have fun doing anything without going into a graduate degree. We all know that your lab skills are super useful when it comes to job hunting. And that you're basically all the same.
Pharmacy - Well now that they opened up admissions a few years ago, have fun rotating between part time jobs trying to (never) find full time. Them old pharmacists just don't die.
LFS - Composed of kids who couldn't get into Science, that will be even more fucked than Science kids once they graduate. See above.
Medicine - Think the engineers have no life? Well they get to do that for at least double the time. At least they get paid lots after they grad (and probably die early from overwork too)
Forestry - ...umm. I've met very little Forestry kids actually. Even less that have a relevant job to their field. Pass.
Engineers - Have fun freezing your butts off somewhere remote. What ARE you going to do around Vancouver, with its nonexistant technical job market? Other than coding (see Comp Sci)
Education - Yes BC requires more teachers. With our ever-declining enrollment and school closures, we need more teachers for the government to pay. Why does anyone think Education is a good idea. Substitute for life.
Comp Sci (Arts/Engi/Sci) - Because you guys spread across three faculties, lets single them out. Just wait for yourselves to get replaced by more outsourced Indians and Chinese. It'll happen. Until then keep being code monkeys. At least in the meantime you can get paid 6 figures and still be piss poor cuz of Bay Area rent. Or be piss poor becoz you're coding in Vancouver.
Business - Keep networking for those (non-existant) jobs. Because we know that you learned a lot of hard skills during those four years making presentations. And that you have a great co-op program. And that Vancouver is a great financial center. /cough
Arts - Saving the best for last. The largest faculty. Also the easiest, and most useless faculty (oh no we have four courses a term). Easily the most butt-hurt, triggered faculty of all, who despite their insistence, actually have a useless degree. Don't pretend, we all know that a BA means no job other than Starbucks. Keep making coffee for everyone else above after graduating with your BA.
*NOTE: The above only applies to Bachelors Degrees (except Education, Med, and Pharmacy). Because we all know that Masters kids are just cash cows for the university, and have fun getting tenure after five years of slaving away and having no life PhD's.
TL;DR Seriously. Everyone's fucked. Chill. Just that Arts kids are a bit more fucked than the rest. (But their courses are so fucking easy guess it balances out)

Engineers - Have fun freezing your butts off somewhere remote. What ARE you going to do around Vancouver, with its nonexistant technical job market? Other than coding (see Comp Sci)
Education - Yes BC requires more teachers. With our ever-declining enrollment and school closures, we need more teachers for the government to pay. Why does anyone think Education is a good idea. Substitute for life.
Comp Sci (Arts/Engi/Sci) - Because you guys spread across three faculties, lets single them out. Just wait for yourselves to get replaced by more outsourced Indians and Chinese. It'll happen. Until then keep being code monkeys. At least in the meantime you can get paid 6 figures and still be piss poor cuz of Bay Area rent. Or be piss poor becoz you're coding in Vancouver.
Business - Keep networking for those (non-existant) jobs. Because we know that you learned a lot of hard skills during those four years making presentations. And that you have a great co-op program. And that Vancouver is a great financial center. /cough
Arts - Saving the best for last. The largest faculty. Also the easiest, and most useless faculty (oh no we have four courses a term). Easily the most butt-hurt, triggered faculty of all, who despite their insistence, actually have a useless degree. Don't pretend, we all know that a BA means no job other than Starbucks. Keep making coffee for everyone else above after graduating with your BA.
*NOTE: The above only applies to Bachelors Degrees (except Education, Med, and Pharmacy). Because we all know that Masters kids are just cash cows for the university, and have fun getting tenure after five years of slaving away and having no life PhD's.
TL;DR Seriously. Everyone's fucked. Chill. Just that Arts kids are a bit more fucked than the rest. (But their courses are so fucking easy guess it balances out)

The first time that I saw my professor, I thought nothing particular of him. He seemed nice enough, seemed thoughtful enough, seemed friendly enough. A couple classes into the term, I started sitting closer to the front and I found myself intrigued by the way he moved his hands when he talked. I liked the way his eyes flashed when he was talking passionately about something. I enjoyed seeing him laugh. These are really vague descriptions, but that's all I can give because I don't actually know him. I can only tell you what I saw.
One night, around early October, I had a dream about him. I kissed his lips. I kissed his chin. He kissed my neck. We slept together, but I didn't see that part, only knew it somewhere in the back of my head I guess. After that dream, I looked forward to seeing him more. I visited him during office hours a few times, becoming increasingly aware of his jaw, his neck, his hands, his lips, his eyes, everything that I could see, and even what I couldn't. I fantasized about doing things to him, doing things for him. At the same time, he started acknowledging me in hallways. He called on me by name. He held eye contact. I felt my chest collapse onto itself. I wanted him so badly, holy shit. To him, it was nothing of course, but to me, oh my God, it was all building and building and building, and I was ready and willing to do whatever he asked of me.
But he didn't ask for anything. I was just another student. This was just another class. I know most of it was all in my head, and he probably had no idea what was going on with me. And now that classes are over, I probably won't see him around as much, but it's probably for the better.
I held back once, but I don't think I can handle being that close to him again.","#3156

Hi. I know you will probably read this because you like this page. But anyway, I just want to let you know that I am somehow emotionally attached to you, perhaps I kinda like you but I know you just see the both of us as friends or just neighbours. I know you once said that you are afraid of relationship because you are afraid to open up to people and get used by them, and maybe one day someone will have the patience to break down the walls that you have built.
Me too. I am afraid of getting myself too emotionally attached as well so I just try to be your friend at least.
After spending time studying and hanging out with you in the library and going out for food, I somehow got attracted to you by your personality and style. We make each other laugh our ass off, rate and judge people secretly and we broke the silence in the middle of the night when we went back. I wish I could speak your language better so I can better communicate with you and your friends, and being friends with your friends too. I wish we happened to be in the same faculty so we can help each other out with schoolwork. But I love my faculty and programme, and you love yours as well.
I just want to let you know that I really want to spend more time whether its studying, eating, shopping, watching tv together or just going out for a walk, leaving the phone behind. I hope you enjoy every moment we spend together. I know this is crazy, stupid, and a really coward way to express what I want to tell you but I have been cheated in the past and it hurts. Hopefully you are still reading this, and hopefully, one day I will have the courage to tell you this without ending our friendship at least. By the way, did I tell you? Dark silver is one of my favourite colour too.
Well, merry xmas and happy holidays. Hope to see you soon again. Cheerio.","#3145

From the perspective of a fellow engineering student, yes, the idea of an arts degree not being worth as much may come up. Now whether that is true or not is not up to me, but this is just not acceptable. Yes, it was a post made to deface arts, but it makes engineering students look like total fucking assholes, the poster included of course. I'd even go as far as saying some of these harm our reputation more than it hurts the reputation of their faculty! Since then, those remarks were deleted (maybe they realized how arrogant and dumb they were being). Arts students, I apologize on behalf of the faculty, and I hope these experiences from the small radical percentage of us don't impact your overall impression of us, as we're not all fucking arrogant bullshit slinging assholes.

I have never fallen in love before. I guess I was a stereotypical nerd before who spent most of my time studying...and what little time I had, I spent playing computer games. Perhaps, it was due to what my Asian parents taught me when I was a kid...that having a relationship is distracting for school. I have always been wary of girls approaching me (not that I was seen that much in public). Now that I am much older and educated (probably a bit over-educated), my parents keep nagging me about getting married and having kids. FML. I know...Asian parent logic. Perhaps, it’s also my strange sense of responsibility and a fear of failure. If I don’t see the future, why start the relationship and waste each other’s time? Nowadays, looking at all those happy couples, I can’t help but feel a little empty inside. What pains me the most is that I could have obtained all that…but I didn’t. And now that distance is becoming even more out of reach. Damn. It is time I take a step in the right direction. I really don’t want to end up with magical powers.
…Which…brings me to my next point. Now that all the exams are about to be done, are there any girls interested in going on a date with me? P.S. I am definitely not bad-looking and somewhat athletic too. Plus, being with me might boost your GPA due to my maximal aura of studiousness.","#3134

After living on campus for years and exploring almost every single building there is from day to night and night to day, I've came to realize there are SO MANY amazing study places for group studies or by yourself. They range from meeting rooms to small classrooms to massive 200+ people lecture rooms. Best part is almost all of these places are open 24/7 AND so little people know about them. In my years at UBC, I haven't encountered a time when I couldn't find a quiet study area with no one around me. I see groups of people crammed up in halls or a big lobby area to study on tables where there's not a single wall outlet when they could just walk down a floor or through a hallway and find all these open room that people seem to never bother to check. When I talk to my friends, everyone seems so mind blown that these study places exist. A lot of times I just want to walk up to a bunch of students trying to get a wall plug or a table to study and be like ""You know if you walk down that hall, open the door, and turn right, you'll find 5 small classrooms that are still empty that you can use""...
But then I won't because I ain't giving up my study place :)","#3132

I was reading a Qu'ron on campus that one of my friends had let me borrow for a few days. I come from a predominantly Christian country (would consider myself agnostic) and am generally interested in other cultures and religions, especially after having come to Canada from a relatively homogenous country.
A group students who saw me reading the Qu'ron asked me if I was in a religious studies that they were taking to which I replied no and explained that I was reading the Qu'ron for personal learning. At that point the conversation turned for the worse as the group of guys realized I'm not just reading the Qu'ron for class, and they began to make comments along the lines, ""I can't believe you're at a western university and honestly believe this garbage,"" ""why are you supporting a violent ideology,"" and worse. I didn't say anything, I couldn't say anything. As someone who comes from a country (and relgious/ethnic background) which has had the privileged upper hand in terms of racial perception throughout history I couldn't feel substantially attacked. However, I did feel a certain understanding of what it must be like to be targeted for some completely arbitrary and innocent attribute that one possesses, as in this case religion. I don't need anyone to tell me that prejudice and hatred are non-existent, I've visited the mass graves in my home country, I've had my parents and grandparents tell me about (and introduce me to) the neighbours they had hidden in their basements when armed militias were searching house to house for the ""other,"" the ""infidel.""
I didn't expect this kind of treatment in Canada, and definitely do not want to blame Canadians or UBC students but I can't imagine how threatened someone other than me, someone or as strong or as ""white,"" would have faired in such a confrontation.","#3112

A year ago, I was in a serious relationship with a guy in my [very small] program at UBC, and I was head over heels in love and happier than I'd ever been. Then, out of nowhere, 5 months into our relationship, he started becoming emotionally abusive. I was in tears almost every single day for weeks, and I started to become depressed. He then started cheating on me with another girl in our class (who was perfectly aware that he was in a serious relationship). I ended up breaking up with him because of the way he was treating me, even though I was still wholeheartedly in love with him. The months since then have been absolute hell. Due to the nature of our program, we are in all of the same classes, so I'm forced to face my ex and his new girlfriend every single day at school, and they don't make it easy for me. I started having anxiety every time I had to be in the same room as him, which seriously affected my ability to concentrate on lectures. To make matters worse, all of the close friends I had last year took my ex's side (?!) and pretty much abandoned me when I needed them the most. In the months since my breakup, none of them have responded to my messages or invitations to hang out or study together, or invited me to anything, and I'm inundated with photos of them having fun with my ex on social media. I'm not from BC, and school takes up so much of my time that I haven't been able to meet anyone outside of my program, so I've basically been completely alone for the past 10 months. I spend my weekends by myself in my apartment. I've tried making new friends, but my program is very cliquey and no one seems willing to let me into their friend group. I have no family on this side of the country. I've become severely depressed, and despite seeking medical attention and therapy, it has gotten to the point that every single day is a struggle to get through. I cry every day, and getting out of bed/doing my dishes/cleaning my apartment/going grocery shopping/cooking sometimes feel like impossible tasks. My grades have been affected, and I'm no longer the straight A student I once was. My life has completely fallen apart in the past year, and I'm heartbroken. I hate my life, and honestly, it doesn't feel worth living anymore. Why do people have to be so horrible? It didn't have to be this way.","#3106

I feel like a lot of students at UBC, especially in the Faculty of Arts, are just wasting their parents' money, with no ambition or aim in life. Like I get that they might be here just for the ""college experience"" but if you're spending so much money on college, you might as well get your shit together and focus on getting something out of your degree (that is worth the money your parents are spending) - very few people have the privilege of attending college, so making the most out of it should be a moral responsibility. What's the point of spending so much money on college if you plan on barely passing your courses and eventually living off of your parents or working odd jobs completely unrelated to your field of study? It is quite depressing to see so many people waste this wonderful opportunity.

I was in a pretty shitty place around this time last year. My grades were mediocre and I had no relevant work experience to offset the fact. These thoughts had been coming up constantly over the term and it would often sadden me to the point of crying in public places and at one point breaking down in the middle of a practical exam.
One evening, while I was making my way back home on the skytrain, I thought about giving up. I told myself I probably have no future in what I want to study, despite clearly being passionate about it. Eventually I got so sad about the thought of being too depressed to pursue what I love I just curled up into a ball in my seat and started to sob loudly. Only one person asked if I was alright, and I later learned he had recently been let out of prison. I knew I brought myself to this point, because I could have studied harder, I could have written better cover letters for work learn positions, I could have pursued more volunteer opportunities. Could have. I hated myself, I felt so useless, I wondered if life was even worth living. But it made zero sense to just sit there loathing myself, and told myself I would keep going.
Nothing much has changed, my grades are still the same, I'm still working some unrelated part time job, but I feel so much better about myself. I just look at this low point and think ""what on earth was there to be sad about?""... I'm still unsure about my future but I hope one day my passion and hard work will pay off eventually.","#3062

I was doing an exam last week and as I was flipping the pages of the exam, I got a deep papercut. The room was dead silent and a silent “FUCK” rung throughout the gym. I looked down at my finger and there was no blood and it didn’t look bad so I continued writing my test. I thought to myself, “oh maybe writing would apply pressure to the wound and it would stop the bleeding”.
2.3456 seconds later my entire palm was sticky and I saw blood gushing out of my fingertip. I panicked and I didn’t know what to do. I looked up and tried seeing if my teacher would notice me staring and would come help but she never noticed. I panicked that I didn’t have time to finish my exam and I didn’t want to bother my teacher so I let my finger hang off the table and blood dripped onto the floor and on the table.
When I finished my palms looked like I just murdered someone. I then proceed to walk out of the exam room and washed my hands in the snow leaving a bloody handprint. I’ve never had a papercut that bad.","#3049

Shoutout to all the people who are enablers in friend groups. You know, the person who brings people together because they are willing to make the first move to plan something.
The enablers are always under-appreciated. I often hear people complain that they haven't hung out with a group of friends for a long time, and that's because no one makes the first move to initiate the hang out. People from my friend group have told me that they're so glad to be friends with me because they meet more people. Several of my friends have become couples because I've introduced them to each other, but unless I initiate something, no one ever wants to hang out. Yet they are so grateful when I do it--to a point where I feel like I've been taken for granted.
Once I invited four of my friends who didn't know each other at all to something, and now they are really great friends. Which is good and I am happy for them, but it hurts that they have an entire group chat without me and plans events never inviting me. So, I want to give a special shoutout to all the 'enablers' in friend groups out there. You make everything way more fun and you really bring people together. If you ever feel under appreciated, never dull your energy, I feel you and appreciate you.","#3034

UBC needs some sort of home ed course, especially for incoming second years.
I supplied a lot of my own kitchen appliances to my dorm, and felt generous enought to let my roommates have access if they needed. Big flippin' mistake. My various roommates over the past term have:
- using metal utensils on my non-stick pans, then washing with wire scrubbers
- left my cast-iron soaked overnight...in soap water.
- using the blade side of the knife to move food off the board
- used said blades without sharpening, then put it back into the block without washing.
- using my knife as a screwdriver
- placed my knives in the dishwasher
- tossed a casserole lid from the oven directly into the cold water sink
- used olive oil for super high heat (hello cancer)
- Microwaved a tupperware with the plastic lid on...for 3 minutes.
- left my LED thermometer in their meat as it cooked
- ""cooled down"" pans and grills by dousing it in cold water after cooking
- put liquid dish soap in the washer
Coming from a family that made us kids prep food from a younger age, I suppose it's my own fault for assuming people knew basic life skills at around college age. I tried to outline some usage rules, but didn't realize that a lot of kitchen fundamentals aren't well known amongst my college peers.
I'd gladly teach the home-ed course myself...but in the meantime I'm locking the cabinet with my stuff in it.","#3018

They told me that they don't ""deal with such cases"" and I need to have ""physical injuries"" in order for them to actually access me, and told me ""to go home"".
So to everyone out there who insists that there are several resources at UBC for people struggling with mental health issues, I strongly disagree. UBC Counseling is all too well-known for its long waiting time and shitty counselors. All SpeakEasy is good for is listening to your problems, and let's face it, they're not professionals and listening to someone only helps a person so much.

It's exam season, but I'm doing everything else but studying. These days specifically, I find myself mindlessly going to the connected single washroom I have with my roommate and just wiping the countertop, washing the shower walls, and even cleaning the toilet and the toilet seat. I have wiped the counter three times this week, wiped my own desk twice, washed over the shower walls once, wiped the mirror thrice and washed the toilet and toilet seat once. I'm quite certain it's not being OCD, because the rest of my room is messy and I haven't vacuumed in a while. (In addition, before exam season, I basically do the washroom cleaning once a month.) Is this the effect of me being stressed?","#2995

My core friend group at UBC consists of mainly engineers, a couple science students, and a couple arts students. Something I've noticed since I've been here is that within my friend group the engineers and science students tend to look down on those in arts because arts is ""easy."" Easy is relative. Though I may have fewer courses, I am still working just as hard trying to balance all of my courses. The engineers I know tend to gloat about their future job prospects and starting salaries while constantly telling everyone how much harder their faculty is than every other one. I do not know if this is solely within my group of friends or this applies to most engineers at this school.
While I understand that the engineers have a difficult and heavy workload, that does not invalidate any one else's degree or choice of faculty. I do not believe any one faculty is more difficult than another, and even if some are, that does give anyone the right to invalidate someone else's choice and tell them that they ""took the easy way out"" by not choosing the same faculty as them.
Some people are naturally better at linear thinking while others are better at creative thinking. Those better at linear thinking lean towards engineering and science while creative thinkers lean towards arts. If I was thrown into the engineering faculty, I would struggle the same way an engineer would struggle in my faculty. It all depends on the person's abilities. A few of my engineering friends admit that they cannot write very well and ask me to proof-read and edit their essays for them. Although they are willing to admit my faculty is not as easy as they think when they need help, they are unwilling to accept that my faculty is just as valid as theirs.
tl;dr engineering is not the only faculty that is hard, and by no means should any faculty be belittled because it's ""easy.""","#2994

I know it's been a while since we last talked, and I'm sorry that we probably won't be talking anytime soon. I just want you to know that everything I told you that night still holds true, and I hate myself for feeling that way. The ""adventures"" we went on together since high school have been some of my fondest memories yet.

I've accepted that you'll never feel the same way, and I'm slowly accepting the fact that we can't be friends anymore, but for some reason you do read this I want you to know that, you're still the apple of my eye.","#2985

I had a thing with this guy I met first year and I really liked him, and I'm pretty sure the feeling was mutal. However I was too scared to proceed any further... I don't know why... but I feel like I always left him with mixed feelings when it came down to pursuing an actual relationship. He'd ask to hang out, sometimes I'd say yes, but sometimes when the setting felt too intimate I'd be scared and make up some excuse that I'm busy. For some reason I always thought he'd be there for me when I was ready to take things seriously, but a person can only wait so long for the other.
Fast forward nearly two years later. He now has a girlfriend, she is the sweetest and everything, but it does pain me a bit to see them together especially since our hangouts are often together. I always wonder whenever I see them if the space beside him could have been me. However I don't have anyone to blame but myself for things turning out they way they did. It's been almost a year since they've been together, and something still always bothers me a little inside.
So, this little confession is a way for me to let some weight off my chest, but also maybe a small PSA for those that are too scared to act with their crush to just go for it. Don't be like me who now is eternally going to wonder ""what if"". Don't regret not doing anything. Don't miss the chances that are given to you, no matter if that is in life,work or love.","#2981

Dear you,
We've known each other for a month now ever since that time where you were forced to get to know me. You were a stranger to me, and I honestly did not like you that much. I hate myself for saying this but somehow, as time goes by, I realized that I can't stop looking at you whenever I met you. That slight hatred, it grew into fondness. I realized that my eyes think you're cute. I realized that my ears love all the songs you sing. I realized that my heart admires your passion for music. Although I swore to myself to never fall in love so easily again, I think my soul chose to like you.
But don't worry, I'll keep this to myself. I know you probably won't be interested in me at all judging by the way you texted me back. After all, I'm just a stranger that will disappear by this winter.","#2958

A few years ago, I sent a friendship card to a close female friend of mine reminding her how much I enjoy spending time with her and how much I value her as a friend. I was not being creepy. She somehow sees this kind of action as some kind of sexual harassment and threatened to call the police on me for handing her this type of gift. She stated that I was not taking a no for an answer despite that she have turned me down. Note that I never had romantic feelings or intention towards her.
Since then, I have a stigma of being falsely accused for sexual harassment and became reluctant when expressing deep appreciation of friendship to anyone, especially females. Whenever I am planning to send out friendship cards, birthday cards, or Christmas cards, I would fully document what I wrote by scanning the card, front and back, just in case if the person I am sending to decides to accuse me of sexual harassment.
At least I have a record of what I wrote and can use it to prove my innocence.","#2935

There was this really pretty girl in my German lit course who seemed kind of nice. Being the super awkward and loner-ish girl that I was, I lent her my crazy detailed notes (I'm OCD like that) whenever she asked after she missed some classes. Towards the end of the term, it dawned on me that she was just using me and not really wanting to be my friend. She missed the last two weeks of class and asked me for my notes to study for finals. I said sure and we agreed to meet up for me to lend her my notes. I never showed up. Boy did she give me the dirtiest look when she saw me at the exams. 😂
It felt good and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.","#2915

I have a confession that's similar to #2898, where I've also received marks that make it so my final group project (due in two weeks) won't alter my letter grade significantly. Honestly, if my final exam this week for that class is piss easy, I'm just gonna head to Victoria a week early. Trololol, who cares about my teammates.
Except I'm not going to do that. You know why?
Because my two groupmates have proven to be the most diligent and hardworking people I've ever worked with. They may not have nearly as solid of a grasp on the coursework as I do, but they work nearly twice as hard. So I'll do the same for them to make sure we knock this project out of the ballpark. I know one of them is riding on this project to go from C -> B, and I'll gladly take one week off my vacation to help her.
Whether we think 2898's OP's plan is right or wrong doesn't matter in the slightest, the end fact is that s/he has the power to make the call. So instead of trying to ride high horses, let's instead focus on not being the slacker teammates who make competent teammates ragequit, and not falling into a position where our fates aren't decided by ourselves but instead by people like OP. Work hard, play hard.","#2911

To the boy in my POLI 100 class:
thank you for a great first term. To be honest, whenever you were around me or talked to me, i felt so light and happy, as if class wasn't just another boring hour and a half of sitting and listening to our professor. During Imagine Day, i was feeling so lost on such a huge campus, and you took the time to talk to me and try to get me to engage with other people instead of just looking like a deer in the headlights. Then on the first day of class when you sat beside me, i was so surprised that someone actually remembered who i was. and i'm thankful for all the times we talked or made jokes in and out of class. because every time we talked, i gained a little bit of insight as to who you are, and i started to have feelings for you. you're smart, funny, kind, and just an overall amazing guy who has his quirks and does really unique things like playing the bagpipes and drinking a carton of chocolate milk every goddamn class. you never failed to make my day better. you're a great guy, and even though i've got a crush on you, i just really want to be your friend. hopefully we can still talk after this term, if you're even reading this. if not, and if we never see each other again, i wish you the best of luck in everything you do. i know you'll succeed in everything you set your mind to. but I'm hopeful I'll see you again.","#2908

The bitch is too cheap to even buy fruits, and the missing chunks of my jam aren’t just jumping out of the jar by themselves.
Well, unbeknownst to her, my folks just sent me a nice small jar of Trinidad Scorpion Moruga Powder, which is hot as shit. I’m thinking of “infusing” my next jar with some of it. See if that doesn’t add a little fire to her next meal.

To the cute engineering boy who was in the lecture right before mine,
Honestly, you are by far the cutest human being I have ever seen in my life. I noticed you during the first few weeks of class. You were always one of the last to leave your class and I was always one of the first to show up to mine. I never really got the chance to figure out who you were and now that term is over, I'm pretty sad.
But I just wanted to tell you that, in the least creepiest way possible, I noticed you. I noticed you on your good days - cheery, with your gorgeous smile and kidding around with friends, and I noticed you on your bad days - messy hair, deep eye bags, and biggest resting b*tch face (you still looked golden to me). I found it adorable how you would sometimes walk your professor out or that you always brought your bike into class with you.
The small things that you do when you think no one cares are what made me care for you. Here I was, a complete stranger, praying to every higher power possible for your safety and happiness.
I don't understand why I feel this way about you, but I do. And although I'll probably never know who you really are, I appreciated the small moments the universe gave me with you. I hope you had a great term 1 and I hope your adventure at UBC is your best one yet.
Sincerely,
The overly keen first year arts girl in the lecture after yours.","#2900

For awhile now, every semester there's been at least one smokeshow in my class that can't keep her eyes off of me which subsequently causes me to over analyze the situation and think of a million ways to talk to her in some nonchalant fashion so I don't seem creepy and then weeks go by where there hasn't been a suitable opportunity and at this point she's somehow instilled within myself this lack of self-esteem when trying to talk her (but i can talk to other hotties just fine), so when I actually get to talking I know I'm not being representative of my awesomeness which exacerbates the lack of confidence, then term ends and I conclude that i'm a fucking pussy and missed my shot AGAIN.

*Update* confession #2768
Following the feedback I got from my post, I talked to a friend about the situation. Despite the many comments classifying the encounter as rape and suggesting I report the incident, I was still unsure as to whether or not reporting it would result in anything other than me feeling guilty for wasting people's time, as I did not actively fight him the entire time; instead, I just gave up and let him because he didn't take no for an answer the first time. Basically, I still questioned whether or not it would be considered rape. To give my friend background on the events, he read the confession, and I asked whether or not he classified it as rape, knowing that I wrote it.
He said it was not rape, just miscommunication or a lack of communication. His reasoning was that because I did not continuously say no every time the guy tried something, I was not clear that I did not want to have sex. According to him, it was my responsibility to ensure that he knew I did not want to have sex, and if I had done that, it would not have gone as far as it did. He said that every time the guy tried to initiate intimacy, he was asking for permission, and by me not saying no again, I was agreeing that that was what I wanted.
Two other guys I talked to argued that it was rape because I said no, but he continued anyway.
I don't know what happened, but rape or not, I feel used and hate myself for my inability to say no to others.","#2831

He said it was not rape, just miscommunication or a lack of communication. His reasoning was that because I did not continuously say no every time the guy tried something, I was not clear that I did not want to have sex. According to him, it was my responsibility to ensure that he knew I did not want to have sex, and if I had done that, it would not have gone as far as it did. He said that every time the guy tried to initiate intimacy, he was asking for permission, and by me not saying no again, I was agreeing that that was what I wanted.
Two other guys I talked to argued that it was rape because I said no, but he continued anyway.
I don't know what happened, but rape or not, I feel used and hate myself for my inability to say no to others.",,1480538634,,,0,11,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1333839813300975&id=1287650764586547,

I love taking arts courses. I really do. But I do not understand how papers are graded one bit. I pour all my heart and soul into a paper, dig deep as fuck into the literature to find something novel. Like break out the highlighters and the post it notes. Give me that google. Grab 5 friends to edit it for me (3 are english majors). DID MY CITATIONS MANUALLY. I get a 70.
3 weeks later for the same class, I stress write something about my feelings on the literature and back it up with a surface level observation based on one word. I wrote 5 pages of absolute crap in 3 hours. I get 95.

I am currently at war with parts of the janitorial staff at UBC and sadly, there is no end in sight. I have finally had it with this sickening, degenerate convention here of demanding that bathroom doors be propped open. This is a disease within our society and it *must* be brought to an end, whatever the cost. I have begun circulating campus during my breaks, throwing any and all bathroom doorstops I come across into the trash. In one building, after having to steal at least 30 doorstops this semester, they have begun attempting to thwart my efforts by wedging an eraser into the door. I will not back down. Why the fuck does this convention exists?? I can see propping open a bathroom door after hours after mopping it or something, but demanding that they remain open permanently?? What the fuck? The bathrooms in Koerner's explicitly say ""DO NOT CLOSE THIS DOOR."" ....WHY? Is this real life? I will not halt my efforts until this sickening convention is brought to an end.","#2828

It affects all areas of my life and exhausts me to the point of tears at almost every moment of everyday. With this, I believe i was sexually assaulted late in september. I'm afraid to go to anyone because I'm not sure if this was the case. It's someone i truly care about and don't want to see get hurt. The circumstances weren't great either, it doesn't feel like my fault but in anyones eyes they'd say I was just cheating on my boyfriend and that i regretted it, and so I'm labelling it as sexual assault. But it has affected me a lot, and trying to be strong and denying what has happened to me, because it makes me feel like a horrible person. I'm trying to make it out of this myself but it's taking a lot and i don't know where to start. All i know is its changed me in ways I'm too scared to realize. And so i avoid talking to anyone or socializing. I try to hide in my room as much as possible, and avoid people at all costs, even if it means not showering for days, or brushing my teeth. Maybe it's just a first year thing, maybe I'm not getting the hang of this. But it feels like my life is falling apart, and burning. I feel worthless and I joke to my family about ending my life ""because uni sucks. haha"". Please someone just tell me things can be okay again. Or eventually.

I know that mental illness is a huge topic and issue at UBC. I just want to say that it'd be great to have more awareness and education around personality disorders like BPD or AvPD.

I don't see a lot of discussion taking place at UBC about trichotillomania. I figured that this would be a good platform to bring us trich-sters together, so we can feel less alone. I know how isolating it is to have trichotillomania. It has an negative impact on your mood, your thoughts, your behaviors, your self-esteem, your academics... I decided to submit this post about trichotillomania to bring us UBC-ers with it together. I'm actually quite curious to see how many of us share this experience.
For those of you who don't know what this disorder is, here's a link: http://www.bfrb.org/learn-about-bfrbs/trichotillomania (warning: there are images simulating hair-pulling that may be triggering to those of you with the disorder).
Now here's a shpiel from your friendly neighborhood trich-ster. if you want some insight into the life and frustrations of someone with the disorder, stay tuned.
* * * * * *
I know that the media doesn't have representations for those of us with the disorder. It sucks not knowing how you could look if you would just let your damn hair grow out before pulling it. I know that I haven't known how I am ""supposed"" to look since I was in middle school. But we need to create representations of beauty for people who have trichotillomania. We need to break the silence as a community and find empowerment in our honesty and in our vulnerability. This is a shoutout to people of any gender who have missing patches on their scalp, or need to shave their heads because ""hiding it"" gets too difficult each day. Thin eyebrows, or uneven eyebrows. Lashes missing. Ingrown hairs from pulling out pubic hair. Just because we look different than the person in an advertisement or the person with the perfect hairline sitting in front of us at our lecture class doesn't make us less wonderful, intelligent, interesting or deserving of love. This is a shoutout to those of us who get triggered by having to sit still and see someone near us twirling their hair, picking apart split ends... I know the feel.
You are not alone <3 Stay strong. We are still beautiful and beauty is more than external appearance, or test grades after nights studying spent anxiously pulling out clumps of hair, collapsing into bed with greasy hair. I know the neck, back, and shoulder pain from hours of twisting and pulling the hairs from THOSE one or five spots.
I truly wish UBC had a community of people with trichotillomania, dermatillomania, and other body-focused repetitive behaviors that band together and support each other. Maybe this post can bring us a little closer to that place?... :)
Love ya, my fellow trich-sters. Have a safe finals period. Take care of yourselves (Said the one only reaching for a fiddle toy after a round of pulling. Just trich things.)

As a first-generation Canadian I often feel the urge to revert back to my childhood back where I came from, which was mostly imported anime.
At school I hang out with friends with similar background as me... also mostly first-generation Canadians.
Do I fit in? I guess well enough. But on cultural terms I feel very out of place. While my friends are either into Western Indie music or K-pop, I found myself in the anime music camp and slowly shifting into the J-rock genre.
Being stuck in two unpopular (in the North American scope) genres, I find myself unable to share good music whenever I spot them, thinking that my friends won't appreciate them enough.
I guess, in a way, I stop sharing all together: shows I like, movies I like, singers I like... they're mostly too culturally different for my friends to even click open the links I shared...
This kinda makes me feel lonely.
p.s. anyone here into (or have even heard of) the band Luck Life?","#2788

In highschool I thought I should take all the control, and I alienated my day ones. So far in uni I've given all control and become unhappy as a result. I can't stop intellectualising my interactions in regards to control. Now I'm trying to find a happy medium, but I'm so unsure of myself.
I don't have anyone to lean on, and make me think, 'ya you're a good guy'. I have made a new group of friends every year at UBC since I transferred after my first year. I wish I had old friends in Van that I know love me. I'm so sick of making new friends and having to put effort into each of these relationships. While Im so unsure of how to act I need support.
My one old friend that still lives in Van is so insecure and unavailable emotionally, that despite us being best friends she is never there when I need her.
This is me. Outgoing, friendly, with always something to do on the weekend. But alone, sad, and wishing I could have someone to open to more deeply","#2769

I'm a first year student this year. It's my first time living on my own and away from my parents. On my fourth day here, a guy I had just met that evening tried to hook up with me. This was my first experience with a guy showing real interest in me, but I didn't want to have sex with him. I said no, and he stopped. We didn't talk for a few days, and I felt shitty, like I had done something wrong and lost my first friend here because I didn't want to have sex.
Fast forward a few weeks. We got together, and this time, we ended up sleeping together. At the end, I asked what he was looking for because I realized I liked him. He was only looking for sex. I held my head high, accepting that that was all he wanted. Fast forward again. This time he tries to kiss me, and I pull away, not wanting his touch. I end up lying down on my bed with my eyes closed, wanting a nap, and he gets behind me.
He dry humped me for the next twenty minutes while I tried to sleep.
Being as shy as I am, I said nothing. This last instance is the most recent time I saw him. He started putting one of his hands up my shirt and one down my pants. I said I didn't want to and for a few minutes he stopped. When he started at it again, I didn't have the courage or strength to say no again. We had sex. Not because I wanted to, but because I just wanted to get it over with and for him to leave. I feel weak and used. I tried to say no, but he didn't listen or care.
I hope the two minutes of sex was worth leaving a woman feeling shattered and broken.","#2768

It's probably a biased way of thinking, but I can't shake the feeling that everyone else is closer with each other than with me. Everyone seems to have really good friends whilst meanwhile I'm just sort of there, and it's lonely as hell. I'm in first year and people say that obviously it's not easy to adjust, but it does seem like everyone has their group of people except for me. I just sort of go to my room a lot and people forget about me as soon as I'm not there. Anyone else feel this way?","#2766

I'm spending about $4700 dollars on my mandatory UBC meal plan this year. Primarily, as someone who enjoys cooking and takes it as stress relief, I was quite dismayed to hear that I would have to eat cafeteria food instead of cooking on my own. However, rules are rules (or laws, I'm not sure) and I get this. It's perfectly understandable.
The months went on, and I found the food at caf decent, so I didn't really complain, even though I thought it was rather expensive. I expressed my dissatisfaction in a survey, because I love taking surveys (trust me, I've done all of your english 112 surveys). I also noted some dissatisfaction in the friendliness of the staff because I've been snapped at.
Thinking nothing much would happen after that, I went about my daily life, until I got an email from the dining room manager. It mentioned how quality food is expensive, and that they are committed to buying the best, which comes at a price. The manager also said that they can't make any apologies and that I should learn to look at my plate with more appreciation, rather than just a sticker price.
I wasn't too offended by this, and as someone who has grown up equating food with love, I trusted them and I felt safe knowing that quality was important to them too. Until I realized that it wasn't.
You see, there is a large possibility that I might be a batshit crazy germophobe, but I do happen to know a thing or two about handling food in a professional context. There have been instances and observations that made me feel a little icky inside. For example, just today, a chef held my burger bun with his bare hand, even though he had a glove on his other hand. I didn't say anything, because I try to be nice to the service staff, but it did bother me. It's not just that, though - I've had someone using their bare hands sprinkling sunflower seeds and cranberries in my salad too. I've seen crumpled paper towels squeezed on the floor with a shoe print in the kitchen, an ignored squashed piece of broccoli, and many more gross things that do, quite honestly, make me squirm. Speaking of hands, I've only ever seen a staff member wash their hands when someone explicitly mentioned they had a deadly allergy.
I wish I could do something about it. With the amount of money I have to pay, I feel like I should at least be reciprocated with quality. Like, perhaps, deli meat that isn't frozen (saw it being opened with my own two eyes) or pie that isn't store bought (I inquired the staff about this and they confirmed it). It would also be nice if they would be considerate and quit yapping to each other in Filipino, as it does give us the impression that they're talking smack about us.
I'm honestly super disappointed, but I feel bad lodging a formal complaint about this because I know how overworked and frustrated staff workers can be, and I don't want to be the cause of a bad day to them.","#2757

I try to control them and seek help and you'll often see me with a hoodie over my head to hide my expressions.
I hate myself so much because of this, I've struggled to make friends, but I feel like no one will want me. I was dating someone from UBC for several years, but I felt so bad that I didnt go to UBC or have similar grades compared to him and it effected our relationship. I often tell myself that no one will want me because I'm weak, and that I'm not smart.

I'm a first year student at Vantage College, a program designed for students who can barely speak English. English is my second language, but I've been speaking fluently for over 15 years, and the only reason why I'm in this program is because I missed two points on my TOEFL exam. Even though the program has a lot of benefits (small classrooms & great staff), I seriously feel I'm wasting valuable time and money in a program that is clearly not designed for me. I'm essentially paying for 38 credits, but only 30 of them count towards graduation. I'm so disgusted in myself for not taking the TOEFL seriously, and I wish I could have done a better job at it.

English is my second language, but I've been speaking fluently for over 15 years, and the only reason why I'm in this program is because I missed two points on my TOEFL exam. Even though the program has a lot of benefits (small classrooms & great staff), I seriously feel I'm wasting valuable time and money in a program that is clearly not designed for me. I'm essentially paying for 38 credits, but only 30 of them count towards graduation. I'm so disgusted in myself for not taking the TOEFL seriously, and I wish I could have done a better job at it.

I am an international student. I pay 6 times the fee of a domestic student. UBC is increasing international tuition by 48%. It's already difficult enough for me and my parents to pay the fee right now. I have to think of some way to pay the tuition. Probably work for hours everyday AND study hard to get good grades. On top of that, I am all alone here. Loneliness has hit me like a truck. I don't have many friends I can talk to. It's like my life is falling apart. No money, no friends, no love.

I groped a girl.
A few months ago I was hanging out with a girl whom I thought was attractive but I never considered us to be anything more than friends. When she got up to go home, she gave me a goodbye hug. As she did, I grabbed her butt with both hands. She seemed momentarily shocked, but didn't say anything and never mentioned it to me. As far as I know, she's never told anyone about it either.
I don't have any excuse for it. I was just a dumb and immature person in a lapse of judgement. I've felt terribly about it, and I've never done anything else like that before or since. But I never apologized, because I was too ashamed to bring it up again.
I still see her from time to time, and she has never treated me any differently. We had a class together this semester and she even friended me on Facebook. Maybe she doesn't hold a negative view of me and knows it was out of character, but maybe it's that in our society women have to put up with so much of this shit that they have to get used to it.
I hate the thought that I contributed to this culture, even once. Would anything be served by me apologizing at this point? Or would that be selfishly making myself feel better by bringing up unpleasant memories for someone else?","#2722

I feel like most people think being a trump support makes you a racist, sexist, xenophobic, misogynist bigot. It doesn't. It does not make you a terrible person for wanting change. It does not make you horrible for wanting to oppose Hilary who has committed countless crimes and will just continue taking bribes and enforcing policies for the benefit of those funding her corrupt ways.
It has become the cultural norm to support her, with all the media twisting and magnifying every little thing Trump says, and only showing Obama and everybody else's favorite famous role models supporting Hilary. The media paints Trump as a devil when he says something offensive, or something he wants to say comes out wrong, but the media barely ever mentions how Clinton was able to prepare for the debates beforehand as she had all the questions, or how she conspired against Sanders and became the nominee.
The reason all the polls were wrong is not because they ""didn't take into account some group of people"" but because the majority of supporters were to afraid to admit they supported Trump out of fear of being looked down upon, being called racists and sexists, losing friends with different opinions, or being assaulted for having a different view on the world, because in the society we currently live in, if you are not a far left liberal, it doesn't mean you have a different opinion. It means you are wrong.
The Hilary supporters, who were mad at Trump for not committing to a peaceful transition of power, are now rioting in the streets because they didn't get what they wanted.
Many people weren't even supporting Trump, but were voting against the corrupt, the biased media, the usual ""politicians"" who never instigate any change, and against all the liberals who immediately shut down anyone with a different opinion and label them as a terrible person. And they won, not because they all thought that Trump would be a great president, but because they couldn't stand to see the extremist Liberals continue to thrive in their quest to make their opinion the only right opinion.
Trump won. Everyone should allow him to accept the presidency and see how it goes. Nothing we do can stop it.
I'm not saying Liberals are bad in any way, I'm just saying that there are some who are to extreme in trying to enforce their opinions in others. Just as there are Trump supporters who are the same.
Open your mind to different opinions. Don't hate. Everybody should have the right to express themselves and not be judged.

I always thought that I had found the love of my life until when I recently got dumped for a 'better' guy she met on Tinder. It hurts me to see her move on. I guess I am ready to move on after reminiscing for the past 6 months but I lack the necessary skills.
I envy guys who can easily approach a girl and confidently ask them for their numbers and go on dates. Before you say it, yes I have watched over 20 YouTube videos on this topic and haven't learnt jack shit.
Any Ryan Goslings out there to help a 'better than average' brown Steve Carell?","#2685

I've been offered casual sex nearly half-a-dozen times since school started, and it's frustrating the crap out of me.
It feels like almost everyone around me is just interested in meaningless recreational sex, but no one is interested in an actual interpersonal relationship. I suppose something about my personality just wants to assign emotional meanings to intimacy, and I've been called ""boring,"" and ""no fun"" as a result.
Like I would've gladly taken any given one of these girls out; don't get me wrong, it's just doting first, cuddles later, but whenever I bring up the idea I've been met with a ""no"" or a shrug too many times for me not to post on the confessions page about it.
If you don't mind some colloquial, crass humor; the best way I can put it is that I need someone to take care of my 'heart' boner as well as my loin boner.

There's a lot of negativity going around about UBC round here. And honestly? If you are struggling to meet ppl, feeling like there's no school spirit, like you have no one to talk to.. Use the resources that UBC puts tons of funding and time and student support into! Join clubs (we have almost 400!), use Speakeasy, sign up for an educational talk, go to a sports game, join collegia, go for puppy days on campus... Meet people who are interested in the same thing!
Take initiative in your life, there are so many ppl here who DO care and want to help but we can't unless you reach out and let us know. You are not alone.

Engineering is really interesting and I'm really learning a lot, but honestly, it's so dejecting. On one side of me are these AP and IB people that know at least half the course material and are acing everything; and on the other side, there are all these people that spent years of their lives learning how to do something outside of the classroom. I'm talking about: instruments, coding , business, cooking, sports, or really anything else you could think of.
Meanwhile, there's me, I got wait-listed until the very end of the acceptance period, have only a rough idea of what the hell is going on, and have no real hobbies to help make friends. Moreover, the friends I do make aren't ones that I'd hang out with regularly, but even if they were, I don't have the time because I'm currently living on my own off campus so I have to commute and take care of everything...
I guess I just feel bad that I tried so hard to set up myself for success academically and ended up failing everything else.","#2633

It's great being a quad-lingual mixed student at UBC. There's a lot of diversity, and that allows me to unleash all of my ""powers.""
The best part is that I can shoot down all the people who trash talk me assuming that I don't speak their language; I get it from all sides of the spectrum because people can't always tell fully which race I am.
So this here's to you; the Chinese girl who called me a ""stupid foreigner"" and the caucasians sitting a table over in the Nest who I overheard referring to me as ""ching-chong."" I hope you each enjoyed my long extensive lecture on how rude this type of behaviour is. I really dragged it out to bore the crap out of you, but it did have a relevant points.
Don't say things without being ready to accept the consequences for saying them, and don't assume people don't speak your language; because you never know when one of them is going to turn around and reprimand you in it.","#2632

Why doesn't UBC have any school spirit?
It's so dead in here.
Several US schools and so many others from different countries have school spirit that's so contagious, it's exhilarating. Some even have strong rivalries.
I'm not saying that these rivalries are good -- they're just one of the examples that show how passionate their students are. I'm not saying that we should be like that either... but we're on the other end of the spectrum.
Maybe we can be somewhere in the middle?","#2627

The guy rushed in to that space and fell on it. He grabbed a little bit of that sweat on his fingers, and brought it to his nose to smell. He smudged the rest of it on his neck. It is not the first time I saw him doing it. Be careful.

We are all aware of the guy who lives on the forth floor of the Irving. At least, we all have smelled his presence even when he is not around. Which, indicates that he must have been there for quite a good some time. But the story is about me being a good Samaritan.
It is my tradition to do some good deeds before the final or MT. Coming from the village after a lunch, I decided to buy this guy a large bottle of Coke and a Bigmac, assuming who would be there. Unfortunately he was not there. I decided to wait for him, since my MT was in the same building in 3-4 hours. Since, it was the only free table on the floor, I crushed on it and started to study. Yes, the smell was awful, but so was my readiness for the mt, so, I decided not to switch a place, wasting time. I was there for two hours, while he did not arrive.
I got tired of sitting on the couch, I decided to lay on the it. Since, it was a start of third hour of me waiting for him, I got hungry. F*ck 'im, I opened the bigmac and started eating it. But, the destiny is a whore, he arrived. I have never seen such a disappointed face. The picture was that some random Chinese dude with 2 litters Coke and bigmac was sitting on his lawful place! He wasn't angry, he was sad. He stood there for a couple of minutes, watching me finish his bigmac.
Then, his grimace change to the determined one, with full of anger and believe that he is right. He is quite massive middle eastern dude! (why wasn't he so determined with his life?). He literally fell down right next time, like I was not even there. I quickly started to pack up, apologizing him in my broken English. While he still refused to acknowledge my existence.
He was angry, I felt that, so, I decided to keep Coke for my self, to drink something on the MT. There is not moral in the story. Just very unconventional situation to me.","#2540

The story about friendship.
I am an international student from S. When I came to UBC and Canada, I didn't know anyone. My first friend was also an international student from R. As me he just arrived to UBC. We shared one room together in totem. In three years, we became very close friends, as I thought so, not yet, the best friends. We spend most of the time together. He forced me to go to the gym and to take care of my outfit. I am a typical asian guy: timid, introvert, and unattractive. He is typical r. guy: outgoing, friendly, enjoys drinking in a close circle.
On one of such drinking sessions after 4rd bottle of vodka, I reached the depression point, while he and his friends just started to smile. The alcohol burned my stomach and the burn reached my brains, all my deepest thoughts were out. I have started to tell them how unfair the life is, that I am still a virgin and not deserve to be with you, about grades, cars etc. Then, I just turned off. I forgot this conversation, and continued my miserable life, hoping to improve myself.
One thing happened, that I thought would destroy our friendship and would probably make me severely injured. I lost my virginity with his girlfriend. I felt really bad. I was avoiding him for some time, I could not watch in his eyes, hoping the time would help. But, I could not avoid him any longer. And, on the next drinking session, I drunk a cap of vodka, and revealed him a thing that teared my heart.
I told him that I had done to his girlfriend. He responded to me: - Oh, of course, I told her to do that. Did you like it? I am proud of you. I have not been prepared for a such turn. Drunk one more cup of vodka. And still could not say a word. He just continued: - I respect you.
I don't keep secrets from me and you are my best friend, I can trust you, I would kill for you. And I could not say a word, just hugged him. He broke up with his girlfriend latter, he holds them no longer than a his pack of cigarettes. I honestly can call him a best friend now.
We continue our drinking session whenever one of us needs one.","#2538

I forgot this conversation, and continued my miserable life, hoping to improve myself.
One thing happened, that I thought would destroy our friendship and would probably make me severely injured. I lost my virginity with his girlfriend. I felt really bad. I was avoiding him for some time, I could not watch in his eyes, hoping the time would help. But, I could not avoid him any longer. And, on the next drinking session, I drunk a cap of vodka, and revealed him a thing that teared my heart.
I told him that I had done to his girlfriend. He responded to me: - Oh, of course, I told her to do that. Did you like it? I am proud of you. I have not been prepared for a such turn. Drunk one more cup of vodka. And still could not say a word. He just continued: - I respect you.
I don't keep secrets from me and you are my best friend, I can trust you, I would kill for you. And I could not say a word, just hugged him. He broke up with his girlfriend latter, he holds them no longer than a his pack of cigarettes. I honestly can call him a best friend now.
We continue our drinking session whenever one of us needs one.",,1477286958,,,20,12,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1296453573706266&id=1287650764586547,

To that girl that could find the courage to come up and introduce herself:
Sorry for leaving you hanging when you offered a handshake. I'm an introvert, and having someone I don't know, especially of the opposite gender, come up and introduce themselves causes me to have small panic attacks, followed by profuse sweating. I'm sorry if I made you feel bad and I still regret it every day. Since we're probably in different majors now (as I never see you), I'll probably never get to apologize for my rudeness face-to-face and give you a firm handshake.

I have trouble peeing in front of other people so I always use the hard to find bathrooms that nobody uses. Whenever I go into one and someone is taking a poo, I always just pretend like all I needed was some paper towel and leave and go to a different bathroom because I know that's what I would want if I was in that situation.
You either leave the bathroom a hero or you stay long enough to see yourself become the villain. I am the hero UBC deserves. I am a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A batroom leaver.

I wanted to just point out a hard truth that I see too many people deny these days: Just because you love someone with all your heart doesn't mean they'll ever love you back..... and that's completely fine.
Unrequited love sucks man but don't stick around waiting for him/her to change their mind or ""come around,"" because you are WASTING YOUR TIME. Go find someone worthy of your efforts. Also, don't wait like several months to ask them out at the ""right"" moment or some shit.
Just ask them out plain and simple. In addition, if someone asks you out don't be evasive and hard to get. If you don't like them, fucking tell them. Despite that, I know you will think it sounds delusional, but sometimes the person that does the rejecting can STILL be an incredible person despite that rejection.
They are not jerks because they didn't like you. They can still be incredibly kind, call you on your birthday, but not out of some sadistic desire to make you squirm. They're genuine, and they're good. They just don't like you and that's okay. If you don't want to see them again regardless that's okay too.
They're not entitled to a friendship the same way you're not entitled to a relationship. But unrequited love is something you should want to lose. Fuck this ""letting go of my fantasy is better than letting go altogether"" bullshit. They could be the greatest person in the world; but if hanging around someone brings you down more than it brings you up, stop it.

They could be the greatest person in the world; but if hanging around someone brings you down more than it brings you up, stop it.

I've always had a rough time when it comes to making friends at UBC (even when I tried making the effort), so much so that it's starting to take a toll on my depression. Last year, I met a group of people I thought I finally made a connection with, however it started becoming more and more apparent that they were hanging outside of class without inviting me. I never questioned it because I didn't want to put anyone in an awkward position or seem like I'm being needy, and instead I just tried planning out group events with them. I just found out on a Snapchat one of them sent to me that they're out getting drunk and having a blast...without me. This is the lowest I've ever felt throughout my four years here.","#2497
