We are new admins, trying our best to make up for damage done in the past. Understandably, you want to know what action we will be taking to prevent any hate on this page in the future. So, over the next 2 weeks, we will be:
• educating ourselves on issues faced by BAME students, both on and off campus

• devising admin guidelines that ensure future admins of this page will align with the vision of a kind and inclusive space for everyone to share experiences, share advice and share a laugh – but NOT at someone else’s expense.

My boyfriend stayed at my family home for two and a half months during lockdown. He flew back to his home country, Belgium, and since being home him, his family and his sister's partner have travelled to a few different cities in Belgium and also in the Netherlands (even right after the sister's partner flew in from another country and DID NOT quarantine). They are going to Italy in a few weeks and it is right before he was supposed to be coming back to stay with me and my family for a month or two until university. AITA for being being bothered by all this travelling they're doing and feeling like they did not take precautions? It doesn't feel right that other people were abiding by 'no non-essential travel before July 1st' and they didn't. Now, I know non-essential EU travel is allowed again, but it is still really bothering me that they are going to Italy. Also, it is right before he is coming back to stay with me and I feel like he is putting MY family at risk too. He says it is not a big deal, the numbers are really low and that they are not staying in a busy city 'so where would they contract it?'. Am I overreacting?","#Edifess4578

In response to the rename DHT petition.
If we are to judge Hume's worthiness of recognition, not on his achievements but how his character stands up to 250 years of social progress, why overlook his moral inequities beyond racism? Does this imply that racial discrimination is worse than that based on gender, sexuality, religion etc?
If all forms of discrimination based on protected characteristics is to be condemned, why does the petition suggest as an alternative Julius Nyerere, who imprisoned thousands of his critics and refused to legalise homosexuality declaring it ""a phenomenon alien to Africa"".
Why are these 'flaws' (as described by the petition) excusable for a 20th century leader, but equally terrible beliefs inexcusable for a 18th century philosopher? If we allow context for one, we must allow for all.","#Edifess4576

I feel like it’s going quite well until predictably, I slip and managed to make a substantial gash in my hand which is now profusely bleeding.

Regarding the recent posts about loneliness: For starters, I'm always down to hang out with anyone who feels like it, don't hesitate to reach out.
I spent 3 months of the quarantine entirely by myself. During those, I talked to friends and family online, but it was no replacement for face-to-face human interaction. It was an extremely interesting time that has given me a glimpse into a different state of existence and perception.
The knowledge that this isolation would be over in a very short while made it much more bearable. But it got me thinking about, and empathising with those who have it as a life sentence. Severely disabled people who don't get to leave their homes, or elderly who have no family and only see a care worker a few times a week. I read this really sad post about someone who is illiterate, they don't follow the news, they have no friends or family, their only activity is to go shopping once a week. When the quarantine happened, they had no idea what was going on. Reality outside had completely changed, and they weren't let on.
I really want to volunteer next September to spend time with such people. This wouldn't involve any sort of physical aid, merely sitting down and having a conversation. I made this submission to encourage people to do the same. I don't know if the university has a charitable wing to it, but I'd love to see some sort of a ""Goodwill Society"", with a single purpose to give back to Edinburgh and nourish a community feeling between the students themselves, and the students and the city. This would be used far beyond just socialising with people, we could do cleanups, planting campaigns, and aid in any societal or environmental causes.
I found this service, but at the moment, they are only doing calls. https://www.reengage.org.uk/","#Edifess4559

After seeing all the posts about struggling with making friends, I want to offer my take (having now finished my degree).
Make time for people who make time for you. Flatmates can make the best friends purely because you can spend so much time getting to know them, and they can be there when you don't feel like going out to meet people.
The worst thing I did for myself socially was to stop going to tutorials and lectures, as I essentially excluded myself from naturally making friends within my course. It became a nasty cycle as it gave me anxiety about going to tutorials where I didn't know anybody. The coronavirus is going to make this even more of a problem, but you will have so many others in the same boat as you. Try to attend everything, even if that means virtually.
If you feel like you're becoming depressed, and that making friends really isn't working, then please tell the people you do know. Most of them will be understanding, and will make the extra effort with you.
Never compare your ability to make friends with the people you know. Statistically, your friends will likely have more connections than you do.
Love yourself, and love others. You will make it through.","#Edifess4551

so I see a lot of people fretting about being lonely and going into third year, pls know that's completely okay!! I don't want to sound like a broken record, but societies absolutely do help. In first year I didn't really relate to anyone at all on my course and was too shy to get involved w societies, but in second year I made a huge effort and needless to say I've met some great friends by joining the gaming society (yes gamesoc ppl will recognise me pls dont cringe at this post)
you don't even need to be a gamer to chill with us. we have a few people who don't even go to our uni/play games who joined our Discord. we have a mix of members from different backgrounds (not all of us are stinky boys !!) We just chat about things on our mind, be it from absolutely nonsense to serious issues like mental health and politics. we're supportive, open-minded and definitely memey, so please don't feel shy! you're always welcome to come to our pub nights and other events <3
i just want to get this out there bc honestly everyone in this society is absolutely lovely and it's totally improved my uni life, so i hope this helps other people! if you're interested in joining then the facebook/discord join links are here https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/societies/society/gamesoc/

Me and him have been super close pals since 2 years ago when I split up with my high school boyfriend. We’re the kind that chat about everything, like annoyingly close pals. And like we ‘help each other out’ from time to time. So fast forward 2 years and I’m now going into honours years at uni, and we were messaging back and fourth on snapchat. And long story short, I may have accidentally sent a nude to my work group chat. Not full. Just me and the text bar. But it was enough to make me yeet my phone across my room, sweat, cry and literally DIE inside. Thank god im on furlough for foreseeable future and won’t be seeing them for a while...

You are right. You should never be made to feel unimportant or not listened to. Edinburgh is your home and your home should make you feel included, loved and respected. Edifess has let you down on multiple occasions.
This is not a post made under pressure or an insincere PR move. An apology from Edifess is simply long overdue. There have been posts on this page that should never have been published. There are no buts or justifications.
We understand the emotional distress that some posts on this page have caused POC in Edinburgh and we are deeply sorry for this.
Anonymity can be extremely valuable for sharing an embarrassing story, venting about a personal issue or reaching out for help. However, anonymity comes at a cost. The cost of removing the consequences of one’s speech. It is possible to say hurtful things for a laugh without consequence and without realising the true impact of your words on people. Edifess has enabled this in the past and it is not okay. We should have never been a platform for views that create a hostile environment for anyone. As Edi BAMEfess has shown, there are enough problems in Edinburgh faced by POC without Edifess contributing to them.
Previously, large admin teams and high turnovers meant that no one took responsibility. That stops with us.
We are proud to announce that currently, the admins of this page are all BAME and we are working towards making Edifess a better, more inclusive page, where racism and discrimination are NEVER tolerated. We will do better.
Although this does not repair the damage they have caused, we have taken down offensive posts. If any are remaining please bring it to our attention, so we can deal with them ASAP.
“What serves as a quick laugh for some stays with us for years and years and makes us deeply sad.” #myediexperience190
This should have been considered from the very beginning, but the least we can do going forwards is ensure that it is taken into consideration for every future post on this platform.

not very shocked here, they are all humans, with their nice flaws
here is what I got in french engineering school:
- Math lecturer with a superiority issue, using our own grades for the examples in statistic lectures, concluded the lecture by ""you're all garbage in math""
- Mechanical Eng. Lecturer having rude/crude talking to the point students where shocked (also sometimes yelling for no reason)
- Drunk lecturer
- Course director having an affair with a lecturer, both married and with kids (the best effort they did to hide it was ""private one one meetings"")
- Some lecturer asking us as ""coursework"" to code a newer version of the student portal & mail server (it was a pile of garbage) and pitch it to the IT admin
- English teacher who considered watching GoT a good lecture
- The internship department (they are mandatory) who respond ""sort it yourself"" when problems arise during internship (Cancellations due to covid where no exception)
- Marketing dpt. relying on the art society for their job
Students where not very better tbh:
- Nearest bar had pictures of us and the owner, and we had a permanent 50% discount for ""incredible returning customers"" (every day after every lecture the bar was loaded by our school)
- Friends and I bought and inflated a sex doll in a middle of a lecture for the 18th birthday of a friend
- (guilty of this one) prep/eating breakfast during a lecture
- having ""networking"" bar crawl with teachers and alumnis, teachers
- someone was watching fucking weird fetishes in the front row, not even bothered by the lecture or classmates","#Edifess4532

Just to address the whole maid/ housekeeper thing. Literally no one is saying that it’s not a privilege to have a house keeper, they just said it’s not unusual in the UK which it really is not; 1 in 3 families in the UK pay for domestic help so everyone in the comments can stop pretending it’s a privilege reserved for the super rich. The guy who commented saying that families should just do the jobs themselves is so ignorant; that would put masses of people out of a job, including my mum (who is a housekeeper); the parents she works for work insane hours and are on call often so they wouldn’t be able to do all of it on their own anyway.

The guy who commented saying that families should just do the jobs themselves is so ignorant; that would put masses of people out of a job, including my mum (who is a housekeeper); the parents she works for work insane hours and are on call often so they wouldn’t be able to do all of it on their own anyway. I think you all need to stop being so judgmental when you don’t actually know people’s situation.",,1593247027,,,121,15,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=880594162448552&id=372762786565028,

-Guest speaker dressing up as a bee keeper to give a lecture
-Retiring lecturer giving his last lecture as Darth Vador
-Multiple lectures where we were given sweets, food and home baked goods.
-A Canadian lecturer yelling at us ""LOOK AT ME"" then apologising straight after.
-A few girls turn up about 15 late late and leave with 10 minutes to go and the lecturer yelling at them.
-Lecturer yelling at people on their phones during a lecture.
-Sat in a hut and looked at a lake as 'research'
-Did a silent disco as 'research'
-Ate food as 'research'
-Random person in the department came out as trans to everyone
-Lecturer having to keep a straight face and talk about Hurricane Bawbag (which is the legit name of a hurricane in Scotland) for about 20 minutes.
-The sheer amount of YouTube clips and films we have watched. Pretty much a film every course, and in some cases every week.
That's all i can think of. I didn't realise some of this stuff was weird until i told some friends, and said shit like this happens all the time.","#Edifess4467

Okay so our toilet is blocked and has been all day. I tried not eating so I wouldn't have to poop but I was really hungry and ended up giving in. Next thing I knew it was poo time. My flatmate was out getting a plunger and stuff to fix it. He was literally on the way home but the urge was too strong. I had to go into the bathroom and shit in a bag. I then proceeded to double bag it and put it in the bin which I took out. It is now the only bin bag in the bin. I'm so scared that the people in my block of flats will find out I shit in a bag and put it in the (outdoor) communal bins. Am I a monster?","#Edifess4465

The link is down below if edifess allows it.

With all the current protests I would like to point out that slavery did not end in 1865 with the end of the civil war in America and it did not begin with the Atlantic slave trade, it is a practise that is as old as humans and STILL goes on today.
Mauritania were the last country to make slavery a criminal act in 2007, however they have jailed more anti-slavery activists than slavers since then. It is estimated that over 9.2 million people in Africa and 8 million people in India live in slavery or ‘hereditary servitude’. People are still being bought and sold and treated as property and history is repeating itself. This is outrageous in 2020 this is still occurring and how silent the world is on this matter.
It would be good to see the same energy devoted to tearing down statues of slavers being applied to stopping actual slavery occurring today in the world and saving millions of people from a life of servitude.","#Edifess4454

""We were in the car park after and my Dad saw his best pal taking their Grandkids to the gig/waiting to escape the car park and asked me to run over and chap the door and say hello to him, which I did. Then about 5 minutes after I got back in the car I realised I had dropped my Avril tee on the way to say hi to Big Ron, absolutely lost my shit and cried all the way home. 2 solid hours of full blown crying. proper ugly crying.""","#Edifess4453

I am now going into my 3rd year, but when the following happened it was freshers’ week of my 1st year. I was in big cheese, looking forward to getting to know my flatmates and enjoying the uni experience. I went up to the bar and ordered a good £17 worth of drinks (if I remember correctly). I tried to use apple pay on my phone, but it didn’t work. I tried it multiple times, still to no avail. I said to the bartender “ah, sorry mate, I’ll just have to leave it then” and began to walk away, apologetically as he had already made me my drinks. All of a sudden, he gets out his own bank card and taps it against the contactless machine. “It’s okay, mate”, he says. He’d just paid for more than £17 worth of drinks for a probably annoyingly naïve fresher he had never seen before. I’ve remembered that encounter throughout my entire uni experience so far, and just want to say thank you to this Big Cheese bartender. It’s people like you who really make a difference.","#Edifess4450

""It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals, because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.""
If she could think that at the time, so can we I believe.

Well I guess this is part 2? Firstly thanks to all the supportive comments on my edifess it really gave me the courage to ""shoot my shot"".
Well. So I messaged her asking her what we were and if we could ever be something more than whatever we are rn. She replied after a whole day and told me that she loved me but there was no world where it would be appropriate for us to be together. She said she's looking for another job since her future at the university is very uncertain and with covid around, I doubt I'll ever get to see her again. After all this, a part of me still wants to run after her and tell her that I simply don't give a fuck about what anyone else says in this fuckin world. I have never met anyone like her in my two decades of existence and I might owe my life to her for saving me at such a pivotal point in time.

In the 1st year Law class there are 4 distinct groups:
The Cabinet: First four rows, attend every single lecture, buy every textbook, swarm around the lecturer with notes and questions. Quintessential first-benchers in school, they arrive between 10-20 minutes early to get the best seats and save two more for their ""gang gang"". High chance of actually getting a first.
The Commoners: The middle part of the theatre, attending lectures is an obligation: they sit half zoned out typing away into an editable lecture handouts doc until they give up 20 minutes in. Make up 95% of the Law Ball first year attendance and post shiny pictures on the gram. Might pull off a first.
The Graduates: Always in the back corners of the lecture theatre. Usually North American and are the only people to scream out the answers to the rather rhetorical questions of the lecturer. Seem ancient and distant, seldom to be seen in Hive or Atik. First year actually counts for them rip.
The Backbenchers: Pop up at lectures once in a while, completely zoned out, have crocs and pajamas on. ""i cba"". Probably take employment as an elective, would rather be at the pub than at David Hume, usually from Falkirk or international.","#Edifess4398

For the past semester I have been hooking up with a staff member at the Main library. I'm from India and I am going into the third year now. I had gotten direct entry into the second year so I didn't know anyone and I was extremely lonely. Plus I couldn't even go back home during the Christmas break. That break was rly terrible because I just had nobody. There was this one time where I was crying at the main library at 2 am and I just wanted to go home. That's when I met her. She consoled me at a time that was just so important- she changed my life. I wouldn't have survived those weeks without her. She often brought me home cooked meals and she even invited me to Christmas at her place. I met her daughter and her mother and they taught me carols. It was the first time I felt at home. When the second semester started our meetings became less frequent but more intimate. She started sharing her personal life with me and her struggles being a single mom. She also spoke about how alone she felt some days and I held her hand and told her that I was there for her. That's when it happened. We kissed for almost half an hour. In the next few weeks, it was extremely awkward every time I saw her in public and she and I didn't speak. However, finally I broke the silence and told her I wanted to meet her. That's when a certain incident occured. Only 2 days after the incident my parents called me home due to the covid crisis and I had no time to talk to her about it. Should I message her? Am I being ridiculous thinking that we might have a future","#Edifess4396

The two are completely different based on circumstances. The point is that police are supposed to be a public service employed by the government to protect the people, paid by our money. But the systematic racism and protections within the police department protect officers who incite violence, racially profile and murder members of the public. Other cops have the power to stop it while it's happening, and then also have the power to hold the offending officer accountable after the fact. But this is rarely done.
Replacing cops with Muslims or protesters is not the same sentiment since protesters and Muslims are not public service workers and don't have power over both the public and other members of the same group or religion. So don't have the power to stop them during or prosecute them afterwards, therefore can't be held accountable as a collective, whereas cops can.
Therefore the two statements are completely different with different meanings and sentiments. Which is why one is wrong (and racist) and the other is just a fact.","#Edifess4394

I am a South Asian female who stayed at Pollock halls in her first year. I remember going to buy something from the JMCC shop. I paid cash because I didn't have my card on me, and for some reason the guy at the till was extremely annoyed by me giving him cash. He muttered something under his breath while giving me change back. I didn't pay attention to it. When he was handing me back the coins, I accidentally dropped my sandwich on thr ground. Suddenly he threw the coins on my face and said, ""You brown people can't do anything right, stop wasting my time."" Some other white students that were in the shop started laughing. It was a terrible experience, especially for somebody who was already not in a good space mentally.
Never told this to anyone but felt like it was important now.","#Edifess4383

I hope someone more knowledgeable than am can help me out. I am asian and I recognise there is quite a lot of racism in the asian community so I have been trying to make my parents (Chinese mother and Czech father ) understand the importance of what is going on right now. I know what they are saying is wrong but I am struggling to put it across in the right way. They obviously think what happened to George Floyd was not okay but have made some arguments that do not sit right with me and I am so frustrated:
1. ""Every country, particularly minorities have faced terrible atrocities in their history (eg the holocaust, colonialism, atomic bombs etc) and they don't continue to bring up their past and let it affect them today. Why is slavery/colonisation in Africa specifically special?"" I have tried to highlight the institutional and systemic racism still prevalent but can someone help me with explaining exactly how specifically anti-black racism is different and why it is more difficult to overcome the past in this case?
2. ""Why are countries in Africa so underdeveloped when other nations previously were previously colonised or had their resources stripped from them such as India, China or UAE that are doing so much better?"" They keep bringing up examples of genocides or atrocities on other nationalities whose countries are now doing well.
3. ""Even though they are arrested at a much higher rate, proportionately black Americans commit more crime and there is more crime in black neighbourhoods, so that's why a police officer would feel more threatened.""
4. They don't understand why this is such a big issue compared to poverty, disease or the environment etc and think that focusing more on improving inequality for the poorest of neighbourhoods in US would be the most helpful thing, and that the damage to the economy will be more hurtful in the long run to black people. ""Why did one man's death result in such a big reaction when there are other giant issues out there? Where are these people when millions are dying of preventable disease? Why is an American life valued more than a child in Africa's life dying of diarrhoea?""
Please note these do NOT reflect my own opinions. I obviously disagree their arguments and have been trying to research and argue against them, but I hope someone far more eloquent than me can put into words why this so so wrong - specifically point 2 that they keep coming back to! Thank you for any advice, I really hope that this generation can be the change <3 <3 <3 Black lives matter.","#Edifess4381

If you, like me, are in an at risk group and can’t attend any protests, something you can do to support BLM (other than donating and signing petitions) is write to your MP to ask them to pressure government into freezing the export of riot equipment and other small arms to the US. UK law states that such equipment shouldn’t be used for internal repression, make sure you mention that. Use the website https://www.writetothem.com/ to make it as easy as possible for yourself.

There is an open letter that has been addressed to the Vice Chancellor of Edinburgh University. This letter urges the university to take action against race discrimination and stand in solidarity with the black and POC community at the University. The letter specifically urges the university to Make a Statement about current events including the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Belly Mujinga; as well as the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on the BME community. Thus far the University of Edinburgh has failed to make any substantial comment despite continuing their online presence. The letter also encourages the University to Promote and Establish Anti-Racist Culture within the University; Develop a Comprehensive Zero-Tolerance Policy; and Create and Support Representation Initiatives.

Right, look BUDDY.
If you have a any kind of shitty take at this time, for example;
- Responding to Black Lives Matter with All Lives Matter (or worse yet, BLUE lives matter 🤮)
- Deflecting from any support to speak about other issues like black on black violence or speaking about other injustices right now not related to racism
- Saying that George Floyd died because he was a ""criminal""
- Or completely ignoring the fact that racism still exists to a problematic degree across the UK
You need to either:
1. Check your fucking privellage right now, admit you've made a mistake, back peddle, apologise, and do what you can to make it up to everyone by helping the cause like donate, spread awareness of racism and white privellage, call out racism you see and get involved in any BLACK RUN protests that are happening if you are welcome.
Or 2. If you refuse to back down from your shitty take and decide to dig yourself further into your hole, you must openly tell everyone ""I AM A RACIST AND I AM PROUD OF SPREADING IGNORANCE"" and accept all consequences that come your way.

With everything going on with the BLM movement and all of the posts people are sharing I think it's really important to remind people that once you no longer talk about these problems, they won't just go away; racism will still exist. So as much as I appreciate my white friends sharing stuff on Facebook, it doesn't really mean much when I think about the racist experiences that I've had at the university that no one took seriously or asked me about. That's why I created a page called 'my edi experience' dedicated to the sharing of racist experiences students have had while at the university. Edifess is a massive platform that allows people to share their experiences, so hopefully this page will do the same.","#Edifess4370

Don't for a second think you blame black lives matter protesters for a second wave, that's been coming for weeks, the government have already pretty much ended the lockdown in England, schools are open, people are back to work, public transport is full, beaches have been packed for weeks.
But do you complain about that? No instead you go after people protesting the murders, violence, racial profiling of poc. This isn't an American problem, this isn't a UK problem, this is a systematic racism problem fueled by white supremacy. White silence is white violence.
(That being said, people who do go to protests stay safe, wear a mask and keep socially distanced. And if you're in a high risk category for covid don't go)

My family (alot of my family are older, which btw they love to use as an excuse as things were ""different in their day"") refuse to accept the white privlige that we have. They always like to bring up the fact that we are from the poorest area in Scotland and how ""we have all had it rough"". How do I get it through to them that we all have white privlige and having/not having money or anything like that has ZERO to do with the struggle of being a POC. They just can't see how they are not correlated at all. I also have began to hate my family because of this. I try my best to educate them best I can but it just doesn't seem to help.

Yes, of course the murder of George Floyd was horrendous, but that does NOT mean that you can suddenly go out and protest en masse in the midst of a global fucking pandemic. Anyone planning of protesting is saying a massive ""fuck you"" to our Key workers, NHS staff and everyone who has sacrificed so much in the past few months in order to flatten the curve. The easing of the lock down does not mean that the pandemic is over.
YES, feel outraged about the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and many other African-Americans. YES, raise awareness on social media. YES, donate to https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/ to help out. But don't think for one minute that organising huge protests in the UK is going to help anything.

I don’t think it’s entirely fair to call students of a whole degree ‘selfish’ for wanting to know the direction their degree goes in for a couple of reasons:
1. For many people, the year abroad was the most attractive thing about the degree and perhaps they wanted to study languages for the sole purpose of being able to practice it abroad.
2. The immersion into the country and being able to talk to locals all the time is the most important part of your language learning
3. I don’t think it’s any different from people wanting clarity from the government vis à vis the state of the country; languages students wanting to know the outcome of their degree is entirely the same.
4. It’s so over the top to say it’s ‘the most selfish thing you’ve ever seen’, we all care about our respective degrees so don’t deny you’d be just as worried if it was your degree xxx

Poor health and an unhealthy lifestyle should not be normalised when it’s one of the biggest killers out there and we should be encouraging these sorts of healthy changes for everyone, people like Adele having such a transformation is so inspiring and motivational for others out there trying to do the same who don’t need protection from you.
And FYI, congratulating someone on something as difficult and praise-worthy of losing lots of weight when they needed to doesn’t diminish the fact they’re also celebrated as an artist?? They’re not mutually exclusive, if it makes you angry ignore it and carry on with your day like a normal person.

A lot of people hate engineers, they think we have a superiority complex. However, most students have zero comprehension of what we actually do. I won't waste my time trying to explain it to you but just know it involves ridiculous amount of work and critical thinking where we are constantly trying to find solutions to problems that people cannot even fathom, to the point where they insist that the problems in this world aren't being solved so they offer ludicrously terrible ""solutions"" that they would immediately abandon if they had any grasp of engineering. Obviously this intense processing power our minds are currently being trained to achieve, so we can deliver the future that other students can only dream/complain about, can be very draining. So our patience with our less well informed ""peers"" that complain about having to pay for a tuition that they themselves value at ""free"" dollars is often limited. We also need ways to relax, blow off steam, be less serious and stop thinking about saving the world as humanity students block access to buildings in protest because their lecturers aren't able to earn enough money (a horrible glimpse at your own future). We have developed many ingenious ways of achieving this, most of which are too precious to share with just anyone. But, in pity, let me share one. Trolling people on edifess

I don't think people, Brits included, truly understand how seriously messed up UK politics has been since 2016. Let's break it down:
a) the Electoral Commission found that Vote Leave, the official leave campaign of which Boris Johnson was the face, broke the law by breaching its spending limit. Source: bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44856992
b) Vote Leave, of which Dominic Cummings was the campaign director, spent £2.7m on targeted advertising on Facebook carried out by Aggregate IQ, a firm closely related to disgraced firm Cambridge Analytica which helped Trump win. The ads claimed the EU was responsible for animal abuse and other lies. One advert invited Facebook users to enter a competition to win money by guessing the results of football games. The Facebook data of all those who entered was harvested by Vote Leave and used to target ads. Source: bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44966969
c) In a 2019 legal challenge (R (Wilson and others) v Prime Minister), Theresa May's own lawyer admitted that the referendum was illegal but said she ""has decided to carry on"". Source: thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2019/02/27/as-theresa-may-loses-control-over-brexit-her-lawyer-admits-the-eu-referendum-was-illegal/
d) Dominic Cummings, now Boris Johnson's chief political advisor, and Ben Warner, a data scientist from Vote Leave, attended meetings of SAGE, the group providing coronavirus scientific advice to the government. This has raised concerns over the independence of this advice especially given Dominic's early backing of ""herd immunity"". Source: the guardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/the-guardian-view-on-dominic-cummings-is-he-able-to-give-sage-advice
e) Ben Warner's brother, Marc, owns a data firm called Faculty which won a £250m NHS contract in August just after Dominic Cummings entered No 10. Faculty and US data firm Palentir, which backs Trump 2020, have now been awarded contracts for the Government's covid app which will harvest confidential data. NHS England reveals the new contracts did NOT go to competitive tender. Source: bylinetimes.com/2020/04/22/palentir-coronavirus-contract-did-not-go-to-competitive-tender/
f) As of a few days ago, four new non-exec directors have been appointed to the Cabinet Office (central government civil service), including the Chair of Vote Leave, the Digital Director of Vote Leave and Michael Gove's ex-girlfriend. On Sunday, Boris announced a new Joint Biosecurity Centre based in the Cabinet Office and ran by his chum from Eton and Oxford, Tom Hurd. This body is expected to take over the coronavirus response.

So in the 2021 economics class there are 3 distinct groups.
First up we have the EconPals/EconSoc people. Now these are your smart hard working, eat sleep breath econ type of people. They are definitely going to get firsts and either go on to become CEOs, making loads of money or a big change in our world, or will come up with a new economic theory that will revolutionise the economics world.
Next we have those known as the Wednesday Group. These are the elite, privileged aristocracy of the economics world. They have been investing since they could walk and have no internship or graduate job worries as they were lined up before first year began. And they are distend to continue their upper class lifestyles after they gain access to their trust funds and take over daddy's company.
Finally we have the other group, with no distinct title. These are more like your average Joe's. They decided to take economics because they did well in school and want to make money. They attend lectures and tutorials as a group, but don't just surround themselves with econ people, they have friends outside their course and participate in other clubs and societies across the university.
If you are an econ student and don't identify with one of these groups you are most likely people who only appear when exams come around or you have your one or two friends in econ and just kick about in a pair or trio.","#Edifess4303

sort of mental health week thank you/ awareness themed:
i'm a fresher (17) and found it really hard to settle in at uni and make friends this past year (i was bullied quite a lot by other girls at school and have quite bad anxiety). there was a week in january when i really thought i couldn't cope anymore and i ended up ugly crying alone in george square in the dark, but one person gave me some hope again:
**to the second-year girl in the tiger pattern coat that studies english lit and religion, THANK YOU for stopping and leaving your friends to come over and sit with me in the cold.**
i don't think i got her name or was maybe too upset to properly hear, but this girl literrally held me in a massive hug while i cried and told me it would be ok, then walked me inside 50 george square and made me a cup of tea and told me that a lot of people feel like this at uni, it would all be ok, and made me laugh until I felt a lot better.
i kept going with uni and did make some friends, and even though the year was cut short, it got a lot better. i accidentally lost the number of the girl that helped me but if you know her or see this, just a gigantic thank you for helping me when I felt probbaly the worst i have ever felt. And to all the kind people doing random acts of kindness to look out for struggling people, thank you so much because it really makes a difference. happy mental health weeek <3333333","#Edifess4302

Most people around me are awesome but there still are racist people, that decide just because I am Asian I deserve bad treatment. Let us please try, as a community, to stand up against racism, if it does occur, because at least on campus, we will have control over that.

Time for an actual confession: I'm a male EU student and I know quite a few people from my course, both male and female. The closest friend from the course is another male EU guy (not from my country). Many people have told me that they think he's gay. Some Brits even told me that they even used me as a benchmark of what a straight European is like. In reality, he has had multiple girlfriends in Edinburgh and I actually found out that I am bisexual here, at uni, because of him. I haven't come out yet but it would definitely make a hell of a plot twist for most people that know both of us.","#Edifess4297

I’m procrastinating revising so I’ve decided to bless you all with the most horrifying moment of my life so far:
So I’m quarantining with my boyfriend in Edinburgh, but my parents live in America so I video call them regularly. This week when I called my dad we got to talking about his fiancé, who is much younger than him. My dad is a really weird guy who lacks a filter, so in hindsight I should have saw all this coming, but I innocently asked if he thought they’d have kids and my father launched into a full on narrative about his prostate/ ability to produce seminal fluid and how he thought that might affect his reproductive abilities. I’m talking full on descriptions of surgeries he’s had in the past, how it’s affected his production of “seminal fluid”, and what various theories about where his semen is going. At one point he said “I don’t know why you’re being weird about this, at one point you were seminal fluid” to which I only managed to say “ah, ya know, we’re all just a bit of seminal fluid”. This went on for at least 10 minutes until I finally managed to make an excuse and hang up.
To make it all worse, when I finally managed to hang up the call I tuned around to find that my boyfriend had been in the room THE WHOLE TIME and had heard everything. My boyfriend is taking it surprisingly well, but I’m greatful my family lives 5,000 miles away and that my boyfriend and dad won’t have to meet eachother any time soon.
So yeah, if you ever think your life is fucked up at least your boyfriend didn’t over hear your father describing his dry orgasms.","#Edifess4283

Hi guys, this is going to sound like some stupid joke but I promise it’s not. No haters pls.
Basically I’ve realised I am addicted to Club Penguin Rewritten. Please don’t comment saying you can’t be addicted to it, I looked up on Wikipedia how addictions works so yeah. Anyway I tried to talk to my mum about it (gotta lova quarantine life lol) but she just laughed in my face. It was really upsetting. I now understand how my yellow puffle must have felt when it ran away after I neglected its needs (yes I know that’s really bad, I am older and more mature now).
But recently the problem has extended beyond the game world. I knew it was getting serious when I looked in the mirror wearing my penguin-pattern pyjamas and orange flippers, and it dawned on me that I have a problem. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even focus on my Witchcraft coursework (bippidy boppidy boo, am I right) and I get a ping of dysphoria when people call me by my human name.
Anyway, if anyone wants to meet up and have a heart to heart over a cheese and anchovy pizza (no seaweed pls, yuck) then meet me on the Blizzard server at the Pizza Parlor. My username is WinglessWilliam17 and I’ll be wearing my membership-only disco jacket (back when membership actually fucking meant something, lmao).

Ok so I just have to get this off my chest. My two best friends, H and L are super in love and have been dating for ages. They actually want to get married. Yes they’re young, but they’re the best fit ever. But H has a super weird and creepy dad who doesn’t like L for some unknown reason. Like he literally hired lawyers to try and find ways for them not to get married. But that’s not the worst part. He made a tinder bio of H and used it to find guys that he approved of... and matched with My boyfriend D. So now my boyfriend of several years has just gone and dumped me for my best friend who isn’t even interested in him.
I’m so freaking upset because I don’t even know what to do anymore. I’m so hurt and I have these thoughts like if I was prettier and nicer and everything else I’m sure he wouldn’t have dropped me so fast. But I still love him so much, and I know it’s crazy but I want him back. I’d literally do anything to get him back.
So I just found out that even though there’s Coronavirus, H and L are going to stay with his aunt, where hopefully they can get married. So I’m wondering: Do I tell my ex that they’re leaving town so that he’ll come back to me? At least if I tell him, it gives me a reason to message him. He wouldn’t try to follow them there like a creepy stalker right? I mean especially while there’s Coronavirus...","#Edifess4087

LOOL let me tell you about the most awkward encounter of my life. So I have a friend who goes to uni in Bristol, he’s a nice decent guy, at least that was my impression. At the beginning of second semester he decided to come to Edi because he likes clubbing here. A few of my friends were going to that event so I went too. And it was great, we all had a really good time.
And now onto the juicy part: after the event, he went back to his friends flat and I went back to my flat. I was just about to go to bed when he CALLS me and says his friend kicked him for some reason and he has nowhere to stay. Loolll in my head I was obviously thinking ‘that’s definitely bs’ but since he seemed desperate I offered him to come sleep on the sofa in my living room. So 10 minutes later he’s at my flat and OMG guess what he says!! ‘Can i just sleep on the bed please, I hate sleeping on sofas’. Boy the audacity. I was like ‘Alright ok, let me just give you a separate set of bedsheets’ and he’s like ‘It’s ok, don’t worry about that, let’s just both use the ones you already have’. Sis I was so confused like.. I didn’t know what he was getting at lol. But since I was tired I just said fuck it, whatever I just sleep. So we went to sleep, in the SAME bed - 2 platonic friends. I’ve known him for 2 years and never even thought of kissing him lol. Anyway. 10 mins in and he starts lowkey snoring. bRo... I was like ok fine whatever. Oh btw I needed to wake up early the following day bc I wanted to go to the library for a bit before my lecture. And then OMG, I didn’t know if he was sleeping or not but his FEET kept touching mine!!!!! like for absolutely no reason..! Even though he was on the other side of the bed!!! Broo I felt so uncomfortable😳 I decided to change position and to move further away from him but he somehow seemed to move CLOSER to me.... I got scared and pretended to go to the toilet but I actually went into my flatmate’s room and told her everything and she went ‘Dude that’s so weird’. Anyway, I decided to sleep in the living room and the next morning I had a weird ass conversation with him about last night and he just said ‘Oh sorry I sometimes move in my sleep’ LOL BRO pleaseee. 🤣","#Edifess4054

So I’ve been trying to talk up my boyfriend to my parents over this festive quarantine period seeing as we’re moving in together this year. As I’m talking to them he sends me a video of himself. My parents see and obviously go “who was that???” And I say “ohhhh it’s my boyfriend he sent a video” so we go to look at it all together.
You may suspect that I opened a nude video in front of my parents, thus ruining their opinion of him forevermore.
No. It was a video of him being filmed, screaming “HASHTAG APPLE CHALLENGE”, throwing an apple in the air, trying to bite it, getting hit in the head by aforementioned apple, falling to the ground and crying.
My boyfriend got cucked by an apple and his sister had the sense to film it.
My parents opinion has not improved.

#Edifess3575 and #Edifess3735 regarding to the Canadian edifess poster complaining that British people are Xenophobic. For context, I’m from the US, also half British. I have been to Canada, and had wonderful experiences there.
I feel very sorry for you that you’re unhappy and am not trying to invalidate your experiences in any way but would like to offer my opinions.
1. There are bad people from every country. You happen to have encountered xenophobic people from Britain. There are also xenophobic Americans and Canadians. There are many people from all those countries who are not. Lumping everyone in a country together and calling the entire population xenophobic because of some bad apples you met seems hypocritical.
2. More xenophobic people will be found in more populated areas. If you’re from a rural part of Canada, there will be fewer xenophobic people there then there are in Edinburgh. I am from a very populated area in the US and so would draw from my experience that it is more xenophobic there than here. There are more people in my city than in Edinburgh. 3. There is probably discrimination in Canada too, but because you’re Canadian and in the “majority” you don’t notice it.
4. I’m also treated somewhat as an outsider, in the sense that people notice that I sound different, and are curious and ask questions. People have made jokes that I’m more educated than some other Americans they’ve met, or said I sound like I walked out of a movie. I happened not to be offended.
5. However, if someone is making a joke and it’s bothering you, ask them to stop. If they do, and apologise, there was probably no malicious intent behind it, and they didn’t expect you to interpret it that way. Jokes about the UK vs. US have historically been seen as two equals teasing/ joshing each other, rather than evil bullying where one party is more powerful than the other.
6. If you’re travelling to a place where you sound unique, however much your passport says you belong, people will ask questions. Humans are nosy creatures.
7. Hopefully you got home ok after university closed from Coronavirus and are feeling better about things.","#Edifess3920

I know a lot of the comments on this are saying the same thing, but you're definitely in a toxic relationship.
The things he's doing that are not okay you highlighted really well:
-the telling you that you can't sing or comparing you to other girls and making you feel crap
-the fact that you're scared of saying so because he'll blame himself
-saying you're in a mood and using that as a way to dismiss how you're feeling
-talking over you even when you're asking to talk
All the comments I've read so far seem to paint him as an evil manipulator. By blaming himself and crying and not wanting to argue, he's gaslighting you and hurting you and you really would be better off getting away from that.
HOWEVER. It's very presumptuous to assume that he's doing this on purpose. He might be crying and blaming himself as a way of making you feel bad for him and dropping the subjects and staying under his control. Or, he might genuinely feel awful about things but be in a position he can't deal with. He might be being like this simply because he doesn't have the emotional availability/emotional skills to deal with arguments, and he might not know what to do when it seems like you're in a 'bad mood' and you're struggling with your mental health. Him reacting by dismissing your feelings is NOT IN ANY WAY OKAY, but it might be that he simply doesn't know what else to do. Normally, the suggestion would be to have that conversation with him and see if he's willing to learn to respond differently because how he's doing so currently is awful and abusive, but if he's unable to even have that conversation then it's probably best you get out of there. You're completely good enough and worthy of love and respect and support and if he can't be that person to you then that's his loss. He shouldn't've made you feel bad about things. He certainly shouldn't have made you feel bad in comparison to other girls. He really might not be able to deal with a relationship at all if this is how he responds to problems. That doesn't make him a bad person- just very incompetent- possibly why he blames himself. It's still not okay, and if this is what's going on, he needs to gain the self awareness to stay away from people so he doesn't act abusively towards them, until he's able to treat them better. (Or he is, as everyone keeps suggesting, genuinely manipulative and fully aware of what he's doing in which case seriously fuck off dude). Either way. You're not abusive. If your mental health is something someone can't deal with, then they should set clear boundaries and always always always be willing to communicate about what they are and how best to respond to things. Not just suppress your feelings and gaslight and ignore you. I hope this helps.","#Edifess3871

For anyone who is still not getting the severity of COVID19:
I have 2 NHS workers as parents and have been categorised as a high risk for getting this, in the past 3 weeks I have watched my parents come home from 13 hour intense shifts, then have a 12 hour reset to go back out and do it all over again. The worst part of this job? They can’t hug their kids or spend quality time due to high risk of infection.
This is just my experience however. There are thousands like me, NHS or not, who can’t spend time with family due to COVID19. Hundreds of thousands are dead, their families not able to even say goodbye or mourn at their funeral. Jobs are being lost yes, but any more lives lost will be more upsetting. Jobs can be replaced, new jobs will come and you’ll be able to get back up for it. However, a human life can not ever be replaced or regained and you want to compare deaths to the economy?? What? You see how idiotic it is right?
I don’t know if this will even get posted but please listen; stop complaining about the economy, stop making unnecessary trips, stop spreading this virus and please show your appreciation for Healthcare workers of any form risking their health and sanity for your safety. I and many others just want to spend time with our family in a safe environment without a very real worry of infection.","#Edifess3820

***Something YOU can do to really help people while we're socially distanced***
Make a list of 5 people you know who you have a feeling might be struggling with the isolation. Then take the time to call them up for a chat.
So many people have seen their usual coping mechanisms become impossible. Others are separated from boyfriends/girlfriends. I know loads of exchange students who are seriously shaken at being torn away from years abroad without the chance to say goodbye to people close to them. And mates stuck at home in toxic family environments.
Safe to say this is a really rough time for a lot of people. If you have 30 mins to spare, give 5 struggling friends a ring. Cheers x","#Edifess3797

I’ve really lost faith in the UK. I’m half British and half North American - and even though I resonate with both identities I’m always treated differently, as an outsider. There’s been many a times where I’ve been discriminated against, and I see discrimination against others too. After Brexit and these bad experiences it makes me wanna leave, but it’s also my home too. I’ve come to feel ashamed about half of my own identity for all the horrible things it’s people do to one another. I know Scots are better but of all my bad experiences most of them have been with Scots. As sad as it is to say as soon as my degree is over I’m getting away from this place because I find it so unhealthy to live in, away from all the xenophobia. Peace out and rant over
Also, pills hard to swallow - you’re probably xenophobic even if you don’t think you are - snide jokes about Americans and their inferiority are not cool, and before you go on about poor American tourist behaviour I have seen how British people act on holiday and it’s just as atrocious","#Edifess3575

To me it seems unfair that the group of people who self identify (into the categories of liberation officers) are able to control such a large part of the EUSA committee. The liberation officers are still representatives of the student body as a whole and NOT just for the marginalised groups they represent. As far as I’m aware the liberation officers had just as much of a role in voting for solidarity with the strikes as any other member of EUSA . So if they’re able to vote on everyone’s behalf like that then everyone should be able to vote for them. It seems odd and counter productive that in a liberal university we are willing to discount the voices of roughly 1/2 the student body. Furthermore who is there to voice our concerns? I feel that the student body is already so disconnected from EUSA (with only 1/6 of people voting last year) more disconnection and discounting of voices seems crazy.","#Edifess3337

I honestly think it is an insult to us as students to not record lectures. They give the reasoning that lectures are 'life events' but in fact it is because they don't trust us. Who do they think we are? We chose to go to university. We are adults, and yet they think we are going to skive lectures because we know they're recorded. One of the most useful tools is now dying? more and more classes are choosing to 'opt out'. If people are to miss lectures, they are going to do it regardless if they are recorded or not. Sure, it gives safety of mind if one would wake up an hour late for their 9am, but it's not taking the piss. Furthermore, though you think not recording lectures will give students less of a reliance on watching lectures before an exam, this is also insulting. Everyone has different ways of learning and revising, and for it to be assumed that lecture recordings are depended on by all, is also quite degrading.

I'm so confused by all these people saying they can't get DICE because of the occupation.
There are plenty of places to get DICE in Edinburgh. I personally like going to Black Lion Games on Buccleuch St, it's a local business with friendly staff selling all manners of DICE; as well as RPG books, board games and accessories.
If you'd rather, Blackwell's have an extensive board game/RPG selection in the basement. It's a bit more bland and corporate than Black Lion, but if you informatics students are so desperate for DICE I'm sure you'll find what you need.
If your issue is having to pay for DICE, I'm sure the good folks at GEAS, Edinburgh University's RPG society, would be happy to lend their extensive DICE collections to students in need.
As you can see, there's no reason to get angry at the lack of DICE when there's plenty of alternatives in Edinburgh.
What do informatics students need DICE for anyway? Seems a little low-tech for computer scientists...","#Edifess3194

To the guy who got approached by security at around 1:30am on the first floor of the library and managed to argue his way out of getting kicked out then and there: Yes, I was eavesdropping but my god I'm more confused than ever. When you left and returned gleefully to meet a friend you whispered something I couldn't hear. I thought you were planning a heist. Or more likely fucking in the library.
When you both left I heard fighting outside and craned my neck to see if it was you because I would have put money on that!
When you both then returned with a pink haired girl and started speaking audibly and ominously about how you HAD to leave in 13 minutes I was a bit scared for life. You then running out of the library before the 13 minute mark didn't help!
Firstly, thank you. My procrastination usually so entertaining.
Secondly, what the fuck were you doing? Why were you getting chucked out? How did you rope so many people into your scheme? Is pink haired girl really the mastermind behind this whole thing?

What exploded alongside the coronavirus isn’t just paranoia, but outright racism. As an Australian-born Chinese, I wanna fuck a lot of you. Honestly, if you want to joke about the coronavirus, I beg you to do a better job than what most of you are doing. If you want to tell me to “get the fuck out of the UK”, people have done that for you. If you want to tell me that “Chinese lack humanity”, there’s not need for the two white women to repeat it several times in my face when I was walking home from uni yesterday. If you want to tell me that “the coronavirus is the Chinese’s karma”, please be more creative. If you want to tell me that “who cares if the Chinese die because inferior races are more fertile”, maybe we can try reproducing together to see if that’s true. So if you just have to be funny, at least be more unique so I can actually remember you. The coronavirus is bad, and some dumb shits have spread it, but if you’re gonna accuse the entire population, just think twice. One benefit of being in the most populated race is that we win easier in gang fights.","#Edifess2867

If you want to tell me that “who cares if the Chinese die because inferior races are more fertile”, maybe we can try reproducing together to see if that’s true. So if you just have to be funny, at least be more unique so I can actually remember you. The coronavirus is bad, and some dumb shits have spread it, but if you’re gonna accuse the entire population, just think twice. One benefit of being in the most populated race is that we win easier in gang fights.",,1580051345,,,321,16,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=772543549920281&id=372762786565028,

Which public school is your university?
Bristol: Wellington - Cool, collected, cash rich, cocaine. A flagship to many for the alternative to an all boys/oxbridge experience for the defectors and failed-to-get-in’ers, you’re often seen as trying a little too hard to distance yourself from your affluent routes and appear cool. Given you arguably have the most fun/can actually talk to the opposite sex, such a reputation is probably a small price to pay.
Cambridge: Harrow - The younger, more aesthetically pleasing sibling to your rival. Like the other place, mentioning your attendance at your institution will automatically either elicit feelings of admiration or judgement from others. No amount of cricket or rowing will ever decide which shade of blue is the best.
Durham: Radley - You’re not quite clever enough to make it in the big leagues - something an older sibling who performed better at common entrance or A-level won’t let you forget. Nor are you actually quite as historic as you make out on the surface. Despite this you’ll put a lot of effort into [unsuccessfully] convincing people that you’re very much on the same level as the two titans, and that their traditional marriage has now become a threesome.
Edinburgh: Ampleforth - Very northern, very boozy and very posh, but posh neither in a played up way (Durham/Radley), or a played down way (Welly/Bristol). Your somewhat remote location means you definitely get an identity of your own, but also means compared to some of your southern counterparts you comparatively suffer on the social circuit.
Exeter: Charterhouse - As Surrey as it gets. Some of your counterparts might look at you as ‘nouveau’, and on balance can we really blame them. Make no mistakes, a good reputation all round, but equally nothing that sets the world alight.
Leeds: Rugby - A true all-rounder. Your name doesn’t carry quite the clout of competitors, but you’re arguably having the most fun out of the bunch. Despite not being quite as academic or in-your-face posh as others, theres little to dislike about you. As a result you have a healthy seat at the social table, and are visibly contented by your station amongst your peers.
Loughborough: Millfield - i PlAy SpOrTs
LSE: Westminster - Being a Londoner inevitably means you think you’re the dogs bollocks. It also means you’re never too far from mummy and daddy, and thus your counterparts will always see you as a bit wet. Undeniably a top-flight institution academically, you’re also undeniably very boring.
Newcastle: Marlborough - Academic, sporty and posh but in a cool unapologetic way which is in stark contrast to Bristol/Wellington who is often seen as your closest counterpart. However like Leeds/Rugby, your name is not quite prestigious enough for the Daily Mail to namedrop in a scathing article they’ll write when your hedge fund inevitably gets caught embezzling money.
Oxford: Eton - The OG bastion of wealth and privilege. You boast the most prime ministers, which you don’t let “the other place” forget. You wrote the rules of the game, and are famous around the world for generally being a top dog. Consequently you’ll spend the rest of your life being viewed as the antichrist by those on the left, which is marginally better than being labelled a pig shagger.
Oxford Brookes: Stowe - Like a pot of clotted cream; rich, white and thick.
St. Andrews: Winchester - Deeply historic, steeped in tradition and fiercely academic. Yet a lack of sporting prowess or fortuitous location serves to make your presence on the circuit somewhat disproportionate. However despite others claims to the title, you’re probably the next closest thing to the institutional power couple.","#Edifess2792

LSE: Westminster - Being a Londoner inevitably means you think you’re the dogs bollocks. It also means you’re never too far from mummy and daddy, and thus your counterparts will always see you as a bit wet. Undeniably a top-flight institution academically, you’re also undeniably very boring.
Newcastle: Marlborough - Academic, sporty and posh but in a cool unapologetic way which is in stark contrast to Bristol/Wellington who is often seen as your closest counterpart. However like Leeds/Rugby, your name is not quite prestigious enough for the Daily Mail to namedrop in a scathing article they’ll write when your hedge fund inevitably gets caught embezzling money.
Oxford: Eton - The OG bastion of wealth and privilege. You boast the most prime ministers, which you don’t let “the other place” forget. You wrote the rules of the game, and are famous around the world for generally being a top dog. Consequently you’ll spend the rest of your life being viewed as the antichrist by those on the left, which is marginally better than being labelled a pig shagger.
Oxford Brookes: Stowe - Like a pot of clotted cream; rich, white and thick.
St. Andrews: Winchester - Deeply historic, steeped in tradition and fiercely academic. Yet a lack of sporting prowess or fortuitous location serves to make your presence on the circuit somewhat disproportionate. However despite others claims to the title, you’re probably the next closest thing to the institutional power couple.",,1578689588,,,61,52,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=760076227833680&id=372762786565028,

Clearly nothing suspicious about those money senders. So next, I told him how I used to be a Nigerian prince and I know medicine does not cost that much. He started arguing that it is a one of a kind and no pharmaceutical company wants to sell it bc it would cure us all and they wouldn’t make any more money.

Hello guys. I'm interested in starting a Pro Bono Society. It's kind of shocking that the university doesn't already have one when most UK unis do and how important it is for the public good. I think that it can be really useful for law and non-law students alike. Please comment down below if you are interested in being a part of it, either as a member or as a part of the executive committee. I'll add everybody to a group chat and we can take it further from there. Here's a cute doggo as a thank you for reading this <3","#Edifess1041

The amount of posts against the KB shuttle bus has gotten mental. First, bitter ved and med students should be asking for their own fucking bus considering the amount of money this Uni makes off us. Second, the Shuttle Buses aren't just for 'lazy people who live in the centre'. They're for people who need to move from KB to Central within a 10 minute time period to make a class, which the 41 rarely manages if at all. They're also for disabled and poorer students/staff at the school who have to make this journey. Third, admins can we stop with all the posts about this? The petition is up, it's gotten all the attention it will most likely get on this page and the continuous one sided posts that get put up here are just low effort and generally dull (or vindictive). I'll start with the quality content, here's a nice dog picture.

I saw the Hive photographer at Waitrose in Morningside yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him outside the club, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.","#Edifess3611

My parents are watching Coronation Street and I forgot had badly acted and weird the show was.
Example 1: Girl with friends in a restaurant, they give her friend gluten bread but she's allergic. She is now in the bathroom being sick. Her friend complains, so to smooth things over the owner gives her a bottle of wine. She then leaves her friend to be sick and joins the table to drink said wine. And no one is concerned that this girl is being violently sick in the toilet.
Example 2: (N.B. This was the Christmas eve episode). Conversation between a little girl and her parents.
Little Girl - ""Where is Santa now?""
Mum - ""Oh, probably over Russia""
Dad - ""His sleigh is going to be shot down""

the end of exams and online shopping: a poem
exam finished, head pounding, face pale,
i went onto topshop...
i heard they had a sale
60% off? pinch me i'm dreaming!
and my wardrobe looked grey
it could do with some preening
so there i sat, fulfilling an outdated stereotype
when a sudden urge forced me to type...
""puffer jackets""
before i could stop myself the page was there before me
red! purple! green!
""no! please! no!"" begged my bank account, forlornly...
and then suddenly there she was! blue, white and green,
the kind the pollock girls wear
reduced from 60 to 15
i added to basket, unidaysed and checked out
and i am now one of them (the ones that think they have clout).
dear friends do not pity me,
for i have chosen my fate
that exam was a bitch

I looked at him and he looked at me, I think in passing. And then when I got to the top of the stairs, I looked back at him for a second and saw him looking back at me. Not wanting to imagine it all, I sat down at a computer.
Then I realized I had a sock stuck by static to the inside of my fleece which was open. I don't know how it got there. That probably explains why I thought he smiled at me. I am so bumbling every day! But I wanted to say whoever it was I thought you looked lovely and wonderful.","#Edifess3354

Is struggling with mental health a legitimate reason to leave university? I want a degree and i do enjoy my degree, but i can't work at my best when in a bad place mentally. I am already signed up with the disability service and i meet a mental health mentor regularly. Even with this in place, university is so so hard. An alternative to leaving would be asking for extensions on work but i have never had to do that and i would feel a bit like a failure. I feel like to study here and be on this course i should be able to cope. I don't want to apply to special circumstances for the same reason as with extensions, but i have had special circumstances before. Anyone else been in the same boat or can give me advice on what to do?","#Edifess3108

I’ve had this thing with a guy, on and off for like a year, we’ve both been kinda shit to each other but it’s obvious that I like him more and he’s treated me worse than I have him. Recently it’s started to get better and we have actually been seeing each other often and it’s been really nice, just chatting and having fun - actual dates, seeing each other’s friends etc. I’ve been thinking that this might be it, and we might start a relationship. He’s still is quite flaky and makes me feel quite insecure all the time - as if he just gonna stop talking to me and start seeing another girl (which he’s done multiple times in the past because I couldn’t see him for a few weeks bc of exams). Anyway, this week I’ve barely spoken to him, I’ve tried to start a conversation a few times, and although I know he’s a horrible texter and even though he has always replied to me, I just have been feeling really insecure. It seems like he’s starting to retract again, I was scared he was going to fuck off again. Basically, I went out and got completely pissed n a little bit high n went home with his flatmates best friend. I dunno whether to tell him because I unsure whether or not we’re basically over. He never definitively says we’re over, he just drifts away and then calls me up in a month to say he’s sorry and misses me. Also, if I tell him he could potentially get angry with his flatmates friend and I don’t want the other guy in trouble because he’s lovely. Anyway, to sum up, pretty much obsessed with a boy who is lovely but can make feel so insecure because of the way he’s treated me and the things he’s done. I slept with a friends of his and don’t know whether to tell him because I have a feeling it’s coming to the end of the “thing” anyway. I don’t want it to end tbh because I really like him but I know my feelings for him aren’t justified because rationally he’s not good for me, and considering what I just did, I’m probably not good for him either. How do I get over him? Should I tell him if we’re not over and do you think I should continue to see him if we’re not - I just feel so drawn to him, I’ve never wanted to be with anyone so much.","#Edifess3244

Hi Edifess, could you help a stressed first-year out?
I've lost my economics notes (on yellow squared paper, stapled together) somewhere in GS library, Drummond open access computer lab or Elephant and bagel. I have turned my room upside down so many times and they are nowhere to be seen.
I know its a longshot but if you have picked them up or seen them can you comment on this post? Suggestions welcome too
Thanks :)

this post is for all of my people from muslim countries: I know all of us are homesick right now, but do you know what I miss the most? BIDETS.
here are some reasons why everyone should use bidets:
1)it's more fucking hygienic
2) environment-friendly
3)you can attach it to your toilet it's really easy
4)lovely fucking feeling after a good old shit (don't try to say anything against this if you have never used a bidet)
5)less wiping
How is something so revolutionary not being used everywhere?!?! It's like a fuckin massage for your butthole - IT'S FUCKIN AMAZING","#Edifess2707

Confused by the Go Abroad process?
On your year abroad right now and struggling?
Visiting Edinburgh as an exchange and finding things hard?
DID YA GO ABROAD AND HAVE A GOOD/SHIT TIME?
If you're thinking about going on your year abroad, currently are on it (or are a visiting student) or are back in Edinburgh after it, we want to hear from you.
We all know the system has got some serious flaws and that many students have felt neglected by Edinburgh uni - so come along to our meetings in the new year where we want to make some genuine changes (there will also be some monetary incentives, and tea/coffee and cake for everyone).

Now this is a confession I have to make. I feel kinda guilty about this but I want your thoughts.
I left the George Square Campus and came across a homeless person. She directly asked for money. I actually had no change on me at all and I only had my card. Instead, I offered her food. But she rejected it. I said I haven’t got any change on me and I would be happy to go and buy her lunch.
She abruptly said “No, No need” and I asked if she was sure. Now for some reason, she simply told me to Fuck off. At this point I honestly thought she was a fake beggar. But thinking about it, I do believe there was a slight language barrier so it is possible she misinterpreted what I said.
I want to ask for your thoughts guys. Did I do the right thing by atleast offering lunch? Please give constructive criticism if you feel I done something wrong. Thanks.","#Edifess2598

Getting a seat in the library is a lot like monopoly; some seats are just inherently better than others.
For instance, if you're looking for Mayfair, or Park Lane, look no further than the laptop seating areas on the southside of the 4th floor, overlooking the Pentland mountain range and Meadows. I say 4th specifically because 4th has the hottest girls. After these, your Oxford Streets and your Piccadillies are on the 5th, which is still nice but has a weird smell to it and is eerily quiet.
There's a lot of interchange for most of the other floors, and these are up to your own interpretation. But there's no disputing that sitting at the Quick Use computers with your laptop out is definitely the brown properties whose names nobody gives a shit about.
Oh, and the Lower Ground floor is jail. Without a doubt. It's just fucking depressing.","#Edifess2513

I am sorry to everyone I hurt by the sexual harassment post. I didn't mean to be so ignorant.
What I tried to say was along the lines of ""When it is reported to security, security should post something such as ""Please be careful around xyz area..., look out for a xyz wearing xyz in this area"" "" just to let others be aware and to let the attacker know that people know where they are so chances are they won't do it again. I'm sure that they can find other places but I just thought that if people know to be aware in certain areas where attackers are comfortable, that area could be ruled out.
I believe the more I say about this, the more I put my foot in my mouth and I am going to offend someone. It is not my intention and I was simply trying to think of ways to help. I am sorry.","#Edifess2380

So Edifess, I need you to help clarify something for me…
A while ago I was seeing this girl a few years younger than me. It was a fairly casual, we would only see each other every now and again what with me being very busy with work.
Don’t ask me how it came up (we had some very strange pillow talk) but after sex one time it came up that she was keeping all her savings and inheritance in an instant-access savings account with a very uncompetitive interest rate.
I told her this was a foolish idea and that she was losing money to inflation. I gave her some advice on how better to save and helped set her up with a much better account. She is now receiving a handsome yearly income as thanks to me all her money is in a tax efficient stocks and shares ISA containing high dividend yield index funds. Not gonna lie, I think this display of economic maturity really got her going and we started having way more kinky sex. I guess what I’m wondering is, does this make me a sugar daddy?","#Edifess2214

First off, people who genuinely experience dysphoria, especially regarding things that are very rigid in our society (such as gender and race) typically suffer a great deal as a result, and all too often in complete silence.
Unfortunately, this dysphoria cannot be lifted by simply “snapping one’s fingers” (which is, by the way, quite a passive-aggressive turn of phrase in this context), though I’m sure those living with it sometimes wish it were that way. If you are genuinely concerned about perverts identifying as transgender in order to harm others, rest assured in that you can now easily distinguish between perverts and transgender people with this simple rule: If snapping their fingers is all takes for them to feel they have “changed their gender”, they may indeed be a pervert. Meanwhile, people who are transgender live with the reality that identifying as such and relieving their dysphoria is usually a process, not a spontaneous decision involving finger snappage. I am a woman, I can tell the difference between the two, and as a result I do not feel threatened by transgender people and am happy for them to use the facilities that correspond to the gender they identify as.
Finally, and probably most importantly in the context of your argument, perverts are perverts. They have never needed an excuse to do the things they do, and I do not believe that this will change now that the majority of our society is accepting of transgender people. Despite how far we’ve come, do you realize how difficult it still is to come out (both to yourself and society) and identify as transgender!? (Apparently, pretty fucking difficult!) Personally, if I was a pervert, that would sound like way too much effort to be worth it. I’d probably just continue to be pervy without remorse or the need for an excuse.
However, I too am open to being ‘enlightened’, and would much appreciate it if you could (kindly) point me to a legitimate source claiming that a significant number of perverts have been found slinking into changing rooms/toilets and claiming to be transgender.
(Side-note: I find it quite interesting that your go-to description of a transgender woman is someone who wears traditionally feminine clothing, indicating that you either have a shallow understanding of the many layers of being transgender (it goes way beyond physical appearance), believe that transgender people have a very limited understanding of gender expression, or (most likely) both.)

#Edifess1183 Really? Because all women like myself want is the right to sex segregated spaces, like changing rooms, rape shelters and bathrooms away from male bodied people. Come back to me about ""pronouns"" when men like Karen White stop raping and assaulting vulnerable female inmates in prison. It’s very easy for middle class women to declare that we are comfortable with males in female spaces when you understand ‘female spaces’ to be the toilets at your local wine bar. Not prisons, not homeless shelters, not refuges ... the toilets at an upmarket All Bar One. Brave.

To the anon complaining about the fact I chose to submit an article from a male author... If you would prefer to read the perspective of other females, I would recommend any of the amazing articles from Sarah Ditum, Julie Bindel, Sheila Jeffreys, Linda Bellos, Anne Ruzylo... perhaps even the work of trans women like Debbie Hayton or Miranda Yardley who have allied themselves with feminists on this issue. Get out of your echo-chamber, kids, because there are a lot of people who don't agree with you, and a large portion of them are LGBT themselves.

To all people from england who call themselves 'northeners' and waltz around on this fact:
Piss off
You're not northerners, you're using a slang word as a fucking knighthood in an attempt to gain some imaginary respect that apparently you get if you're a 'true northerner'. You're not from the north and you don't come from a 'rough area'; you likely have a posh accent and you live further south than half the fucking country. You make fun of people from southern england in an attempt to throw them to the wolves to save yourselves from the fact that you're exactly the same as them.
You had a 'tough time' working good hours and a half-decent paying job to get to university with help from the bank of parents, and now it's hard to pay for all of your blue wkds; which would be fine if you just accepted the fact that you're well off and didn't pretend like you got a tough break just because you're 'from the north'.
Also, when making game of thrones references about the north, a word of advice.
Don't.
As a highlander, the analogy runs dry all too quickly when you think that having a medium sized sainsbury's and a shitty little park 5 mins from your house is 'living the wild life'. Try having frequent power cuts, non-stop rain, a 1 hour drive to any decent sized shop, and chopping firewood in a swarm of midges during what's meant to be summer but feels like death, literally just to stay warm during the winter. I personally am not in a rough position where I'm fighting financially to stay in education, but chances are, you 'northerners' aren't either. People genuinely in financial struggle aren't worried about if people see them as northerners, they're too busy worrying about paying to stay alive...
Wholesome morals to take from this half-joking post:
- Don't bullshit yourself and others, it's unhealthy for you and a dick move to others.
- Don't be so ashamed of your background that you have to exaggerate yourself to be someone you're not. Help and sympathize with those who actually need support instead.
- Remember that no decent person gives a fuck where you're from.
- Feel free to absolutely judge people on what they say and do. Go berserk. Just not on what their situation is.
Final note to all triggered 'northeners': I'm not judging, or doing anything I said not to, to anyone from northern england. I'm judging the people who boast about it. Like yourself. No one gives a fuck that you're from yorkshire","#Edifess1137

Hey, sorry to hear you're feeling homesick! Firstly, it's completely normal to feel this way - most students will go through it at some point. You are allowed to feel sad and homesick and you are also allowed to enjoy yourself – it isn’t being disloyal the people you miss! Times of feeling low, stressed and anxious are part and parcel of moving away. There is always a period of adjustment that people go through when faced with any change. Here are some tips to deal with homesickness:
- Talk to someone! I promise we're friendly (most of us anyway). If anyone approached me feeling this way, I'd be more than happy to sit with them and talk about it. If you haven’t yet made friends yet, then try a tutor, supervisor, chaplain, older students (I know we can be a wee bit intimidating) or a member of the Student Wellbeing Team. Remember that many other people will be feeling the same way, even though you may assume that they are doing fine.
- Give yourself time to adjust. You don’t have to get everything right straight away.
- Keep in touch with family and friends form back home, but don't forget to fully immerse yourself in student life and get involved with societies/sports etc. Don’t let looking back actually hinder moving forward.
- Invite friends and family to visit - maybe not straight away but after the first month, encourage friends and family to come and see you in your new home.
- Remember to get enough food and sleep! They affect us both emotionally and physically.
- Meet up with other people. Make contacts and friends through shared activities such as sport or other interests. There are so many clubs and societies within the uni and city that you are pretty much guaranteed to find something to suit your interests. Try something new. Keep active. It will take your mind off feeling homesick!
- Make yourself at home. Make your room as comfortable as possible… unpack and decorate with some comforts from home. Have friends over from other flats!
- Remember to look after yourself and be aware of when you’re feeling down. The uni's Health and Wellbeing team are always here to support you.
- Lastly, if you're struggling with homesickness or any other issues - feel free to message the admin. They love juicy gossip and a good roast but they're also a bunch of super friendly people who have helped me and a few other students out :)","#Edifess220

The Higher Education Policy Institute calculated Gini coefficients for the Participation of Local Areas (POLAR) in the 2016 UG admissions cycle. They ranked all UK higher education institutions in terms of their coefficients. A coefficient of 0 means that the institution is “perfectly equal” and a coefficient of 1 means that the institution is “perfectly unequal”.
“The best measure on equity of participation in the UK is the POLAR (Participation of Local Areas) system. Based on the higher education participation rates for individual areas, the POLAR system ranks wards according to their participation rates and then divides them into five groups (quintiles), each of which holds an equal proportion of the young cohort. The quintiles are numbered 1 to 5, with quintile 1 areas having the lowest participation rates and quintile 5 the highest.”
The University of Edinburgh: 0.42
Edinburgh Napier University: 0.35
For context the best in the UK was the University of Hull with a coefficient of 0.03 and the worst was the University of Cambridge with a coefficient of 0.48. The average for a UK institution was 0.18.
BOTH of the universities have issues with class and University of Edinburgh is the superior university in terms of academia in almost every measure (See QS world rankings and methodology). It is not as simple as classifying students as classist when the university they are criticising for being less academic also have a MAJOR problem with admitting students from working class backgrounds.
