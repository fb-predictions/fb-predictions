We‚Äôve seen our platform grow through war, sharking, and disease, and that was just in Freshers week. Since then we‚Äôve been together through strikes, a global pandemic (and the numerous uni emails that accompanied this), flatcest, rankings of counties and cities that nobody asked for, and the tearing down of the Colston statute. Our admins have been working hard for months to go through the 37,412 submissions we received this year, so : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42aPmtnVDg. As such, we will be pausing submissions and posts.
Thank you for a lovely year, we shall see you (online or not who knows, certainly not Hugh) in the new term.

The BLM movement has made me feel really guilty and I'm not sure if that's justified but I thought I should say what I'm feeling. My family were refugees from Iran after the Islamic Revolution and settled in the UK in large numbers. However, they were quite wealthy and all had good educations so weren't really affected too badly apart from being banned from re-entering Iran. One of my distant family had a servant that had come with them from Iran. The two (both female) lived together until around 2008 when they both died. I always felt uncomfortable about this as a child but didn't bring it up until now (having become more conscious about my privelage and wanting to ask questions about this kind of thing). After a few weird answers I did some digging and it turns out that my Iranian family have quite an infamous history and that my actual fucking GRANDAD, my actual grandfather, OWNED AN ETHIOPIAN MAN in the 1950s. Like, not even a servant - an actual fucking slave. IN THE 20TH CENTURY. I actually feel sick and I don't know how to process this because I feel physically ill. Thank God my grandad is dead becuase I don't think I could ever talk to him again. The worst part is that my Iranian mum doesn't think there's anything wrong with this because ""it was a different time"" and that it was legal where they were. What?! It's literally in living memory! I don't know what happened to the poor man aside that he was a gift from someone in the Iranian government and later ran away. I don't know how to deal with this because I've been the victim of racism in school but now it turns out I'm as bad as white people. My Dad (white) is equally shocked and is unsure about how to feel about this. On the one hand, I know I'm not responsible for the sins of my ancestors but I can't help but feel desperately guilty about this. I'd appreciate any opinions.","#Bristruth29885

Your reaction by suggesting that not ‚Äúall men are the problem‚Äù is not fixing anything. Of course women know that not all men are bad. (And men claiming women feel this way simply to undermine them are totally incorrect). However, a lot of men are oblivious or don‚Äôt care about the micro aggressions that women face. If you have a look at #bristruth29845, you can see that many women do feel safer due to social distancing. Society should be asking itself why does it take enforcing distance between people to make women feel safe. Moreover, to suggest that women are ‚Äúpretending‚Äù, highlights how ignorant you are. Many men understand and support women, but do so through understanding rather than undermining them. Instead of whining that you are different, why don‚Äôt you speak to your female friends and family about the instances of sexual assault they have faced. Be better.","#Bristruth29883

#Bristruth29872 You know what? I‚Äôd rather be a man and experience my gender being stereotyped as violent/prone to assaulting people, than ACTUALLY get assaulted as a woman. No one is saying ALL men are predators, or assault women, or are dangerous. But enough of a majority are that makes the average woman feel so unsafe that public mandated social distancing allows a welcome break from being harassed in the street. Enough men ARE sexual predators that every single one of my female friends have been assaulted or raped in some from of another, or have at least one horror story to tell of an encounter with men. I think you need to check yourself and realise the bigger issue is that women are constantly faced with danger every day, and rather than crying ‚Äònot all men‚Äô - you need to check your inherent bias, call out people who show this sort of behaviour, and hold your friends accountable when they do this.
P.s: don‚Äôt come here with this whole ‚Äòbut men get assaulted too‚Äô bullshit. Absolutely men get assaulted, and it‚Äôs an awful issue which is often turned into a punchline and isn‚Äôt discussed enough. But if you‚Äôre just bringing up ‚Äòbut men get assaulted too‚Äô ONLY when someone is talking about female assault - then you don‚Äôt actually care about the issue. You‚Äôre just trying to detract from the conversation about female assault, just like when people say ‚Äòall lives matter‚Äô when discussing BLM.","#Bristruth29882

In response to the bristruth about pop and indie music:
All genres of music will seem to lack originality and skill if you only listen to them on a surface level. Indie music is not inherently bad, in the same way you say pop music isn‚Äôt. But if you really want to criticise a genre for having artists that lack talent, you‚Äôre going to sound very silly if you‚Äôve just admitted to being a pop music fan. Maybe try expanding your horizons a little and stop criticising others for their taste in music. People can listen to whatever they want to.

3. Do not tell me that the corgo's would not look better in the crown. If you do, you're a liar.
4. We could downgrade the palace and make it a homeless shelter, with the corgo's having a dog house palace with 24 hour guards. Saves us a cool billion over the next few years.
5. Corgo's breed like rabbits and don't give a shit about the crown so there would never be a problem over succession.
6. Do not tell me it would not be hilarious to have millions of people tuning in on christmas day to watch a dog bark around and shit on the carpet.

Back to contextual offers, my issue is that it allows the government to escape improving state schools to allow student there to do well. It's a lie to say we can't bring up state schools to a similar standard in terms of grades. Hundreds of the best state schools outperform private schools. Look to other nations like Germany where private schools only exist for those with special academic needs and nealry all are educated by the state. Instead of lowering out academic standards let's force the government to ensure we all meet the same standards?","#Bristruth29853

It's a lie to say we can't bring up state schools to a similar standard in terms of grades. Hundreds of the best state schools outperform private schools. Look to other nations like Germany where private schools only exist for those with special academic needs and nealry all are educated by the state.

One thing that I'd like to highlight about quarantine / lockdown - as a woman, social distancing has made me feel much safer. I'm not sure if any other women will share this sentiment, but the enforced distance between people has made me feel much safer when it comes to physical sexual assault / unwanted touching. As someone who has been physically sexually assaulted in public by someone unknown to me, a huge weight has been lifted from my mind when it comes to going outside by myself. Where I've previously felt very nervous being outside by myself, passing men in the street or parks, or being near men I dont know due to my previous experience, social distancing has provided me with a physical and mental breathing space from these worries. I'm really interested to see if other people may have felt this way, as its been a really unexpected side effect of lockdown","#Bristruth29845

For those of you who say that anti semitism isn't present at Bristol , let me explain some instances that happened to me over the three years I was there.
1. I was spat on called a '""yid""and told to ""return to Israel where I belong""
2. When someone I knew dropped a penny on the floor , one of her friends asked me why I didn't scramble to pick it up as I was jewish.
3. When I said to someone I was minority for being Jewish they replied with "" no but you guys don't count because you are white and privelaged""
4. At a party I was told I was "" pretty for a Jew"" and that they were shocked I "" didn't have a big nose or talk like the other North London Jews""
The worst part about people saying these things is that the people around me didn't stick up for me, or even acknowledge what was happening. I'm not saying this stuff to throw anyone under the bus. Jumping down someones throat and calling them a racist doesn't help anyone. They just need to be educated more about said religion / culture/ race. I am saying all this to highlight to everyone how important it is to look after your friends, minority or not.

Ranking of moving out cleaning activities:
#1 (god tier): freezer/fridge - this usually depends on the hygiene situation of the rest of your flatmates but chances are this has never been cleaned since moving in. You‚Äôll find sweet memories of your flatmate‚Äôs ex-partners (and current) who bought crap and left in your fridge months ago, meat of creatures that probably existed in the Mesozoic era given their expiry dates, etc. Things can take a juicy turn if stuff inside have started rotting and the juices start leaking off the food and gets frozen at the bottom - yummy!
#2 (Whoever thats just below god tier): Toilets - people usually expect the shitter to be the grimmest part in here, but take my word they are wrong! Things look fine until you walk into the shower and take a peek into the rarely reached rear ends of the shower caddy. You‚Äôll find shampoo bottles that have been sitting unused for ages but have started leaking, hair blocking the shower drain making the cubicle flood up to your ankle. This latter is usually something that you‚Äôd grown used to as it has been happening pretty much monthly and by now you‚Äôve spent a lot on shower drain cleaners. The culprit is usually someone who shaves his pubes in the shower (or a flatmate‚Äôs girl friend who doesn‚Äôt care cuz it‚Äôs not her place - pretty obvious if you find long hair in an all guys flat). Although you‚Äôve got to be careful as this unknowingly could be you yourself - but if this never happens when you live alone for a while then definitely is not you.
#3: Oven/hobs - this is not far off from the fridge and again depends on the hygiene levels of your flatmates. Imagine bits of chips and god knows what else being baked to perfection repeatedly over a year! Now imagine them being served with fat and a touch of charcoal around the oven door and at all corners of its interior - absolutely amazing!
#4: cupboards - doesn‚Äôt sound like much but wait till you find poorly washed cutlery and bits of food that have been rotting in there for ages. If you are responsible for cleaning these, the trick is to wait for others to leave if possible so you can just throw the stuff away without worrying about them wanting them back.

I‚Äôm now heading into 3rd year and (assuming uni still goes ahead) I‚Äôm wondering whether it‚Äôs now too late to make any friends at uni? It seems like everyone has formed their set social bubbles and there does seem to be a stigma against those who struggle with social anxiety and making friends. Even though I really like going out and stuff, I have had a hard time making friends at uni and it has been a very lonely couple of years. This lockdown has really reinforced to me that I have no friends and people who keep in touch with me etc, and seeing lockdown being eased and friendship groups meeting up on social media has emphasised this. The prospect of a friendless future does scare me and time seems to be running out. I‚Äôm just wondering what people‚Äôs experiences were and whether people can eventually make uni friends through societies/support groups in 3rd year (and without judgement from people)?","#Bristruth29822

I did a STEM degree in Bristol on a contextual offer, coming from a state school in North England. Graduated first in my year in the end. Contextual offers aren't tokenism; they help people realise their full potential. I didn't have the grades or subject requirements to study my subject at other Russell groups. At the time I struggled to articulate my thoughts or have confidence my ideas so would never have got in if there was an interview. No one was pushing me to do better, or helping me to think about problems in a certain way. That's the kind of thing private school gets you. Now I'm doing a fully funded PhD in Oxford and it's all because Bristol gave me a chance. I don't have a chip on my shoulder about my 'background' because I'm part of the majority in the UK. I just wanted to encourage people to think differently about the reasons for contextual offers and affirmative action in general. Free-market 'meritocracy' will always lead to further inequality until there is true equality of opportunity.","#Bristruth29802

Over the past month, one thing has been thrust into the public eye following the murder of George Floyd and that is the systemic racism that is built into our society. Protests all over the world are still occurring today and attitudes towards racism are finally starting to shift. It is important though to carry on that fight, to not let politicians and businesses pay lip service and move on as if nothing happened.
That is why Bristruths have created the following document. It highlights the amazing contribution that BAME LGBT+ individuals and QTIPOC have made to the fight for liberation. From the birth of pride with drag queens and ‚Äòtransvestites‚Äô to today's modern heroes who lead the BLM campaign and UK Black Pride. We encourage you to read the document with an open heart and do your own research into the amazing history of gay liberation.
As always, stay safe and remember to look after your mental health during this time. Take a break from social media, check up on your friends and spend time with family. We have also included a list of resources, petitions and sites to consider donating to in order to continue the fight for equality.

How is the sacking of RLB even slightly justified under the narrative of antisemitism? I am very open with this matter, and very willing to have my opinion changed, but for those who havent read what she retweeted, she basically shared an interview of an actress, in which the actress claims the Isreali secret forces train the US police, and that the US police got the knee on the (extremly dangerous and clearly wrong) neck tactic from them. This may or may not be true. Its known that the Isreali forces do infact train US forces, and there are many pictures of the Isreali forces detaining Palestinians in a similar fashion. So my question is, how on earth is what she shared antisemetic? If anything its more antisemetic to equate the isreali govn to Judaism, which is what people are doing when they say what she said was antisemetic, imo. Thanks.","#Bristruth29797

In response to a lot of ""defund the police"" posts on Instagram: I see your point, but surely taking weapons away from American police will only result in carnage if the population are allowed to bear arms? Defunding police and taking their guns away will surely only heighten gun violence and crime rates. Defunding the police in a heavily-armed country is like asking airlines to take pilots out of planes because 50% of crashes are caused by pilot error - but would you get onto a plane without a pilot? No, because the number of crashes they prevent is greater than those they cause. Similarly, taking the police weaponry away will only increase crime because the police will have no way of stopping people using weapons irresponsibly and committing hate crimes. The best solution is to ban guns altogether, which seems to be working better here in the civilised world.
Defunding the police also does nothing to prevent systemic racism which is what sparked this debate in the first place - why not instead use the funds to educate the police in the damage that their racism has done, which seems more sustainable in the long term?","#Bristruth29795

Im an international black student and I have to say, this university is very cliquey. When it comes to other men especially, from my course to my societies, to my accomodation; all my closer friends are international students since despite making up much less of the uni population, always make an effort to involve me in the group and reciprocate my efforts.
I never made it into the home student friend groups who since freshers would always have plans and meet up and act like they knew each other before uni and already have inside jokes and all. They generally felt impenetrable. So my interactions with home students are more temporary despite my genuine best efforts.
I even realized I still barely know anything about this country and have no friend from here i can even call on.","#Bristruth29759

Heads up UoB, UWE is currently undergoing a review, with one of the outcomes including scrapping Philosophy degrees.
The official statement credits a concern of the programme's ""long-term viability"" as the largest reason for the review. With the Guardian's 2020 University Guide ranking UWE's philosophy offering highly, at sixth in the whole of the UK, this move comes across as a financially driven decision.
Chris Bertram, the professor in social and political philosophy at Bristol University has already spoken out against it, tweeting: ""[This is] a terrible decision that will inevitably reduce access to philosophy for students outside the Russell Group and similar.""
Below is the link to the petition, I also suggest emailing lecturers, staff and other UWE representatives.

Types of Coffee Drinkers (alphabetically, obviously):
The artisinal: Owns at least 4 different instruments for coffee making, probably has 'a supplier' who hooks them up, judges everyone else's coffee tastes, actually knows the difference between a single and double roast, will only ever go for dates at reputable hipster coffee establishments. Wouldn't be seen dead in a starbucks
The caffeine head: Drinks any brand as long as there's a high amount of caffeine, less than three tablespoons of instant in a morning cup might as well be decafe, is the only person to ever get value for money for the unlimited coffee by going up at least times, occasionally disassociates because of it. Wouldn't be caught dead in a costa, prefers greggs because of their size.
The fake caffeine head: Claims to be a caffeine head but can't handle anything stronger than a teaspoon of instant, complains about 'caffeine withdrawel headaches' after a month of drinking decafe, only ever orders mocha's in cafe's. Wouldn't be caught dead outside of a starbucks, needs a ratio of 100:1 whipped cream:caffeine
The Moderate: Actually normal with their coffee drinking, has one cup in the morning with breakfast after a good nights sleep, doesn't talk about coffee at all, probably owns a machine or caffetiere but doesn't brag about it, most functional of them all, doesn't drink coffee after 10am. Wouldn't be caught dead buying some weird bat poo coffee
The Party animal: Exclusively drinks cold coffee from tesco express after a raging night out, still legally drunk at noon. Looks pretty dead in a 9am.
The Pill popper: Takes caffeine pills for some reason, placebo affect kicks in and they think their dependent after 3 days, doesn't actually drink coffee despite that being infinitely healthier, probably the one person most likely to not actually need the caffeine boost. Would not be caught dead inside a pharmacy actually buying them, always gets them off a friend for free somehow.","#Bristruth29753

You don't love the pub - you've developed Stockholm syndrome for an addiction to alcohol. You go to the pub because you're not bothered to think of anything else to do. And you spend half of your savings in there. Then you wake up with a crippling hangover, which ruins half the day. You heard it here first - fuck the pub. Lockdown has given us the opportunity to take a step back and reassess how we spend our time, and all we can talk about is getting back to the pub. Let's have some imagination lads. Sit in the park and idk like bring a board game or something. And if you wanna get drunk buy some tinnies for a fraction of the cost.","#Bristruth29732

I am sooooo happy I went to a state school and even if I become financially able to send my kids to private school there is no way in hell I would. I believe state school offers you things you're less likely to receive in a private school, such as learning within a class of children from a diverse range of backgrounds, knowing and harnessing how to work hard because no, we don't have tiny class sizes so if you want to get your grades, you put the bloody effort in. Obviously you also work hard at private schools, but from what other posts have said, your academic learning is made easier. But that's not to say I wasn't supported in a state school, I freaking LOVED my teachers, they were truly inspiring and put the effort in to each of their students to get to know them and their needs. A lot of you are apparently upset about the misconceptions of your private schools, but there is also a huge misconception of state schools. Growing up with friends who went to local private schools, I've received comments like ""my dad says if I'm bad he'll send me to your school"" and ""are you scared of leaving things in your locker in case they get stolen?"" and to my mum ""oh, your daughter got into Bristol, was that because of a lower offer?"" Just to point out, I had THE best time in state school and couldn't have asked for a better education, made amazing friends and yes bloody got in to UoB, not through recieving a lower offer, which I did btw, but by exceeding the original offer (and with a free education lads). State school kids, be bloody PROUD, because your education gave you so many more skills than some people seem to believe.","#Bristruth29731

The whole idea of private schools seems so massively unfair to me. I highly doubt that any child pays for themselves to go to a private school with money they have earned. So it is essentially based on what family you are born into and whether they can afford to send you to private school or not, which is something you have no control over at all. These kids get a massive advantage for essentially being lucky.
And the gap between state school and private school kids is only going to grow at the moment: privately educated students are receiving virtual lessons and great communication from their teachers whereas state school students are being sent a few worksheets each week.
I simply can‚Äôt understand how private schools are still accepted in today‚Äôs society, all they seem to do is increase the wealth gap even more, producing young adults who live in their own bubble and cannot fathom the realities of the world we live in. Sorry Allegra/Hugo but your 2 week trip to India/Africa helping impoverished children has not made you ‚Äòwoke‚Äô to the hardships faced by the majority of the planet.
These kids are then flung into top universities doing courses like medicine that require empathy, I struggle to see how they can ever be empathetic when they have never even seen half the hardships their patients will be facing. The ‚Äòwoke‚Äô ones will judge others for for not saving the planet/being vegan/ buying fast fashion/ using plastic with no thought to the fact that sometimes people have no choice but to do these things-beef is a lot more nutritionally dense than lettuce Francesca. They seemingly forget that it‚Äôs their 1% killing the planet the most.

In response to the post about private schools being more advantageous than state schools.
While obviously yes, there is no denying that there are many benefits that come with going to an independent school, the assumption that those that attend are rich and therefore instantly have more opportunities is very misguided. There are multiple scholarships and bursaries awarded for people to be able to access private education. Not only that, but for many parents to send their children to a private school they have to significantly cut back in other areas; they simply value their children‚Äôs education over other things. Be careful about making blanket statements about the type of person someone is or the opportunities they had access to, just because they went to a private institution.","#Bristruth29686

Pride Begins:
In 1970, on the anniversary of Stonewall, thousands of protestors marched along Greenwich Village which runs past the Stonewall Inn, in what now people have considered the first Gay Pride march. The event, led by Craig Rodwell & Brenda Howard (""The Mother of Pride""), was originally coined as the Christopher Street Liberation Day March. The march, which soon became an annual fixture, was held in order to highlight the community‚Äôs lack of basic civil rights. Many of the people who were involved in organising this protest were the founding members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF).
Overall, early pride marches were often rarely attended due to fear; and encountered many counter-protests because of the outlandish costumes and colourful floats. However, to the surprise of the organisers, the 1970 New York ‚Äòpride‚Äô march attracted thousands of people. The organisation of the march was a truly monumental task and involved the cooperation of over a dozen LGBT+ rights groups. 2019 Pride marked the 50th anniversary of Stonewall and 2020 marks 50 years of pride since the original march.
Early demonstrations focused primarily on people feeling proud to ‚Äòbe out of the closet‚Äô, on individual freedom and on the diversity of the LGBT+ community. As time went by, more and more cities began to host their own pride marches and they became more and more celebratory ‚Äì eventually evolving into parades rather than marches. However, by the 1980s most major U.S. cities hosted their own events and - particularly due to the spread of AIDS - pride also incorporated socio political activism and many of the marchers carried placards that focused on social issues of the day.
The phrase ‚Äògay pride‚Äô, synonymous with parades in the modern age was thought to be implemented instead of ‚Äògay power‚Äô because ‚Äúpeople did not have power back then, even now, we only have some. But anyone can have pride in themselves, and that would make them happier as people, and produce the movement likely to produce change‚Äù - Craig Schoonmaker; who, alongside Robert A. Martin (AKA - Donny the Punk) & Brenda Howard, coined the term 'gay pride' and were both influential in helping to solidify pride month. Interestingly the reference to 'gay pride' was also supported by Sylvia Rivera, an influential drag queen/‚Äôtransvetite‚Äô and LGBT+ activist.
But why are gay pride parades just that? Why, when they highlight the work still to be done to reach equality, are pride parades more like celebrations and festivals than political marches? The oft-quoted reason for the existence of pride is, indeed, that there is still work to be done. There are still (at the time of writing) 12 countries in the world where gay people can still face capital punishment (execution) simply for being gay. In the U.S. the efforts of LGBT+ rights groups are being reversed by President Trump and all over the world there is a severe lack of equality.
Many people are afraid to come out either due to fear of rejection or danger to their lives if they do. And that is why the jovial and celebratory nature of pride parades can be vitally inspiring. It is also important to contrast the often headline grabbing images of issues that the community face (such as abuse and homelessness) with images of happiness and celebration.
Nowadays, Gay Pride which occurs throughout June is massively popular. Events attract millions, with marches occurring in cities like Amsterdam, Chicago, London, Mexico City, New York, Paris and San Francisco. It was estimated that more than 2 million people celebrated the 2007 Europride event in Madrid. The event, hosted by a different European city each year, was first hosted in London in 1992 and has grown ever since. Madrid also hosted WorldPride, automatically assuming the Europride label, in 2017 ‚Äì the next time the two events will merge is in 2021 in Copenhagen.","#BristruthsPride

Hi guys! To beat the lockdown blues, I've created a form where you can recommend an album, and me and a couple of other volunteers will match you up with a like minded music lover, who will send you an album recommendation in return. Then you and your match, after two weeks of listening, discuss what you think of each other‚Äôs recommendations!
It‚Äôs a way to connect with like-minded people, discover new music that‚Äôs been selected for humans by humans, and give someone else the joy of discovering your favourite album for the first time.
If you'd like to give it a go, please fill in this form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1smiKg_mfzNtn4J-bHr0R6I2U2AX_CW1XWxCZz7cPNvw/edit?fbclid=IwAR32WmQKTdwmDcw9X6IDKBhriGJMmuD1_f5-BzzuJoa3cQ11XAUvlxAfX-0#response=ACYDBNi0SgCwqQ5lEoaAfO3vvpueHy4s0D1yTRrwtuAjZMB0VQrnVLCv1LGBP0lHrZ_-6Fc .

Okay I really do feel I need to write this because some people who go to Bristol clearly don‚Äôt realise the advantage going to a private school provides.
So here‚Äôs a list of advantages most students at private schools have in comparison to students at state schools
1. Smaller class sizes - this enables a teacher to spend far more time per a student.
2. More equipment and resources - many state schools are extremely underfunded which has a massive impact on subjects such as art and computer science.
3. Better links - private schools on average have far more links to companies and people, which enables students to access work experiences opportunities such as in law firms and hospitals that are usually unavailable to an outsider.
4. Personal statement support - private schools give each student far more support and in some cases write areas for their students. This simply doesn‚Äôt happen in state schools, often the only help is via proof reading.
5. Parents who are able to afford remarks and resits. So many people from state schools are simply unable to afford these luxuries.
6. Tutoring- along a similar vein this is far too expensive for many families in state schools.
7. Interview prep for university - this is not something normally offered in many state schools.
8. Extra curricular - again this relates mainly to the fact that those in private schools are, on average wealthy, and can afford to pay for their child to learn instruments or go abroad to volunteer etc.
9. Increased Coursework Help - this is due to a smaller ratio of teachers to pupils.
10. Parental involvement - this is more significant than you many think, having a parent who is proactive in your education and encourages you to work is a huge benefit. Although this obviously occurs in every school, it‚Äôs far more frequent at private schools.
Now many of these things may seem small and insignificant but they really do add up.
I would also like to add that you don‚Äôt automatically get a reduced offer for going to a state school. That‚Äôs just simply untrue.
Contextual offers for schools are given to underperforming/ at risk/ bottom 40% state schools. These tend to be schools which have a v small progression to university.
I would like to point out that there‚Äôs a reason people spend an extortionate amount of money to send their kids to private schools.","#Bristruth29667

On contextual offers: Universities aim to give all applicants equal chances of receiving an offer, even if they may be at a disadvantage compared to other applicants. This is done via positive action, which often takes the form of contextual reduced offers. This is where applicants who are from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds are considered for offers at lower grades than the standard offer for a course. Factors considered include the performance of the applicant‚Äôs school or college at GCSE and A Level, as well as the average progress to higher education of the area of the applicant‚Äôs residence. Lower than average figures in either category can increase their chances of receiving a reduced offer. Some universities, such as the University of Birmingham, require multiple conditions to be fulfilled before giving a contextual offer; but others, such as Bristol, only require one in order to be considered for a reduced offer. In the case of the latter, it means that two people in the same year in the same school that they have both attended since Year 7, thus receiving the same quality of education, can receive offers with different grade requirements solely because they live in different areas. Does that really make sense?
Why is this a problem?
Similarly, some universities will give reduced offers to students from state schools solely based on the fact that they attend a state school. When applying for sixth forms, I was told by one (state, non-selective) that I could have a better chance of getting into a top university than if I had continued at my (grammar) secondary school‚Äôs sixth form. I personally don‚Äôt feel that I have had any disadvantage in terms of my education, yet I could‚Äôve been eligible for a lower offer from some universities. On paper, the idea of giving more offers to students from non-selective state schools than private or grammar school students makes sense, but in reality, it fails to take into account a myriad of other factors that would better decide whether a student should receive a reduced offer. They don‚Äôt know anything about the applicant‚Äôs home life or their family‚Äôs background. What if their parents saved up for years just so that their child could receive a better education at a private school? Does the spoilt child from a rich family who went to a comprehensive school deserve consideration for a lower offer, even though they would‚Äôve had just as many opportunities, if not more, to further their education? This is the general issue with a lot of contextual offers: the universities do not have enough information to decide who really does deserve the opportunity to go to university with lower entry requirements. As a result, they have to use the data that they do have, which results in situations like these, where groups of students, whether they are at a disadvantage or not, are all eligible for reduced offers because they tick a box that says they go to a state school, or they live in a certain postcode. The system is fundamentally flawed. This is not necessarily the fault of the university, but a flaw in the application process, which does not provide a sufficient amount of information required to accurately portray the applicant‚Äôs background and circumstances.
It‚Äôs important to note here that I am not suggesting that contextual offers should be abolished entirely. Many reduced offers are given out for perfectly valid reasons, such as missing school time due to illnesses or having special educational needs. I have no issue with these. But sometimes, it does feel like they are given out too generously. Progress is being made, with universities such as Birmingham requiring more than one criteria to be fulfilled, but the only way to properly address the problem is to overhaul the whole system. Individual situations should be considered individually, instead of it being a checklist type system which not only allows reduced offers to be given unnecessarily, but can even prevent some people who should get one from receiving one.","#Bristruth29641

Straight people, stop over-sexualising your LGBT friends. I can‚Äôt speak for everyone but I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs not just ‚Äògay jokes‚Äô that make sexuality a punch line, it‚Äôs other comments too. Directing remarks about relationships and sex specifically at gay people that you wouldn‚Äôt at your straight friends is very uncomfortable. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre not someone who tells their friends about hook ups or anything, people can make you feel like this is information you owe them just because you‚Äôve shared something about your sexuality.
To that end, you can identify however you want and you don‚Äôt need to share your credentials to ‚Äòprove it‚Äô, you don‚Äôt even need to have any!
And to the people who slip in these quips or ask weird questions, you‚Äôre showing how unfamiliar you are with having queer friends and that it‚Äôs not normalised in our friendship - I hope it can be.","#Bristruth29640

Here's another rank list for you guys
Strange Things characters ranked from worst to best: (WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS)
13. Jonathan Byers ‚Äì While I definitely shipped his and Nancy‚Äôs relationship from the start we must not forget the fact that his hobbies include taking pictures of people without their knowledge ‚Ä¶ creepy. Defo lost some cool points there. Not to mention that after season 1 his character doesn‚Äôt see much development making him one of the more forgettable characters of the season.
12. Nancy Wheeler ‚Äì While she definitely has some pretty badass moments, in general her storyline isn‚Äôt that interesting. Especially in season 3 where they randomly make this character interested in journalism. ???
11. Billy- Ah Billy‚Ä¶If he hadn‚Äôt been a total psychopath until the very last minute, I would have ranked him higher. I must admit Dacre Montgomery‚Äôs acting was superb, how he actually got us to sympathize for a character who literally runs kids over for fun I‚Äôll never know. Also, he‚Äôs hella hot.
10. Will Byers ‚Äì While, yes admittedly the show wouldn‚Äôt exist without him, he didn‚Äôt have much screen time in the first season and I do feel like, no offence, he just doesn‚Äôt have as much personality or flavour as the other characters in the group. Sorry, not sorry.
9. Mike Wheeler‚Äì Him and Eleven are beyond Adorable. However, he can act pretty selfishly at times and get pissed off at people (ahem Max) for literally no reason.
8. Lucas Sinclair ‚Äì He was annoying in season 1 but definitely redeemed himself in later seasons. He‚Äôs a pretty good friend and definitely has his moment of genius at the end of season 3.
7. Jim Hopper ‚Äì Our hero. Hopper is definitely one of the funniest and bravest in the series and I do not lie when I say I balled my eyes out during the letter scene. Unfortunately, he loses points of being an asshole for most of season 3.
6. Max- This girl is as cool as it gets. She‚Äôs badass, she doesn‚Äôt care what people think and she‚Äôs an awesome best friend to Eleven. Actually, if Eleven didn‚Äôt have superpowers Max would probably be cooler than her too.
5. Eleven ‚Äì Everyone in the show would be dead without this girl. Absolute badass.
4. Joyce Byers- Mum GOALS. She‚Äôs kind she‚Äôs caring she always knows what to say and while everyone else always thinks she‚Äôs crazy (magnets anyone?) she doesn't care. In the end, she's always right anyways! Also, her kids ALWAYS come first.
3. Erica Sinclair ‚Äì She‚Äôs sassy and super funny, a natural fit for Steve Dustin and Robin‚Äôs group in season 3. What‚Äôs not to love? HER HIGHLIGHTS: Murray: ""I'm sorry, why is this 4-year-old speaking to me?"" he asks. ERICA- ""I'm 10, you bald bastard""
2. Dustin ‚Äì He‚Äôs funny, energetic and his toothless smile is just downright adorable. His friendship with Steve makes those two the ultimate duo. Not to mention that the singing scene with his girlfriend who turned out to be real, Suzie, was definitely the funniest and most iconic moment of the season.
1. Steve Harrington- MOMMA STEVE. Talk about character development. He went from the person you hope dies in the series to the person you hope never dies. Him adopting the gang is the best thing that happened to the show. I swear, if they kill momma Steve, I WILL delete my Netflix subscription.
Honourable mention ‚Äì
Bob ‚Äì Superhero Bob. I really thought this guy was gonna turn out to be a dick. Proved us wrong. He brings out Joyce‚Äôs nerdier side and is sweeter than a doughnut. Wish he‚Äôd stuck around longer so I could put him on the official list.","#Bristruth29634

My experience as a JCR president was absolute BULLSHIT. As my team and I were the first JCR for our accommodation, we had to start fresh whereas other accommodations such as Orchard Heights and Manor Hall were able to plan events easily and early on. We, however, had no bank account, no access to funding and a very large international community to cater to as well. I was absolutely fuming working one on one with Resilife.. honestly, if you want to call anyone incompetent it's then. They lacked the ability to answer emails, take responsibility for their mistakes, attend meetings, communicate in general and overall just lacked the basic organisation necessary to keep this partnership running smoothly. Our JCR only received access to our money for the year, LAST WEEK. Funnily enough, we've not been in Bristol since March so that doesn't help anyone.
We had so many plans as a JCR to cater to the wishes of the residents but without access to the money and Resilife refusing to pay for events while they held back our money, we were essentially stuck in box. It's as disappointing for a JCR member as it is for a resident to see that money not go towards our plans and not be able to give people what they had asked for. However, what I must say is that if you are going to come for your JCR team without understanding the circumstances that Resilife put them under and also, hello, there's a global pandemic, I'm sorry the government took away your formal that we, as a JCR, worked our asses off for HOURS a week to plan. I was just as pissed off when they cancelled it. But please don't attack your JCRs and call them incompetent when you don't understand the ins and outs of why things happened the way they did.

A note about my own privilege.
First things first, I do not now, nor have ever, considered myself bigoted in anyway. If you'd asked me what I thought about equality when I was 4 or 14 or 24 I'd have given you similar answers, although hopefully advancing a little over that time. The events I'm about to list, the things I've said and done, I did not consider prejudiced at the time. It is only through personal growth and education that I can look back now and see how they were wrong. Almost everyone has been guilty of this at one point or another. Those saying they haven't are either one in a million, lying to themselves because they can't face the truth, or just plainly still bigotted.
I feel that at the moment, with everything that is happening, it is more important than ever to recognise our own (often sub-concious) prejudices and privileges. So here goes. Here are some of the ones I have been guilty of, some of which I've only now recently considered.
""That's so gay"" was, for quite some time, the go to insult to use in my experience of primary and early secondary school. I used the word gay as an insult on many occasions. To me, it never meant homosexual. I thought the meaning had changed over time. I was wrong.
This is a privilege I hold through being 'straight'. I've never had to worry about telling my friends and family who I really was. I've never had to hide who I was in love with. I've never had to hide part of myself.
I'm sorry.
I've used sexist insults. I've used certain insults more about women than about men.
This is a privilege I hold through being a man. I've never had to worry about walking through a deserted place late at night. I've never had to think hard about how what I wore would be judged by other people. I've never had to be scared that my voice and ideas would go unheard in a group, simply because of what was between my legs.
I'm sorry.
I've been guilty of not considering my privilege when it comes to race. I've been at a work Christmas do on premises when it was closed to the public. A black man came up and stood outside. I went outside to tell him we were closed. He said ""I know"" and so I asked what he was doing there. I would have done the exact same to anyone, regardless of race. But I was guilty of not understanding how what I said may come across.
This is a privilege I hold through being white. I've never been asked what I was doing simply because I was standing around. I've never been interrogated by the police for doing absolutely nothing. I've never had to fear for my life simply because of the colour of my skin.
I'm sorry.
I've been guilty of being rude to taxi drivers. I've been in rushes and gotten annoyed when the destination has been misunderstood.
This is a privilige I hold through living in a country thats language is my first. I've never been shouted at to leave the country, simply for the language I was talking in. I've never been attacked for speaking to a friend. I've never been looked down upon for not being born in the country I am in.
I'm sorry.
I've dismissed older peoples views, simply because they were older.
This is a privilege I hold through being young. I've never had to worry about being mocked or patronised or ignored, simply because of my age.
I'm sorry.
I've used ableist language. When I was growing up ""that's so gay"" was probably on par with ""that's so retarded"" as the go to insult.
This is a privilige I hold through not being physically or mentally disabled. I've never had to worry about accessing a building that others could freely access. I've never had to worry about not being taken seriously, due to a speech impediment or hearing issue. I've never had to go through being asked to explain a traumatic story of how I became disabled to someone I barely know.
I'm sorry.
I've participated in jokes about all of the above and more. I've told them and laughed at them with friends. Yes, they were jokes. Yes, my friends and I all knew none of us really prescribed to those viewpoints. Yes, I thought that meant it was OK. I was wrong.
This is a privilige I hold through being a young, straight, white, able-bodied, male atheist. I have never been discriminated against based on anything. I have no idea what it's like, or what billions of people go through in this world on a daily basis. And I'm so sorry for my ignorance. I consider myself an ally, above all else. I have for some time now. I have made mistakes. Yes, I was much younger, but this is no excuse.
All we can do is fight to be better. To recognise our priviliges, our prejudices and our mistakes and then fight to create a society where they no longer exist.
Most people in the West hold some form of privilege. Be it from being white, male, straight, not-disabled, young, Christian or atheist. Many people hold multiple privileges as they are members of more than one of these groups. We MUST recognise these.
We must see when they are being taken advantage of, both by ourselves and others, from the past, present and future.
Only then can we begin to drive them away, and truly make the world a fairer, more loving and more beautiful society.","#Bristruth29516

#BristruthsPride
It is widely documented that one of the people who was responsible for the start of this riot was Marsha ‚ÄòPay no mind‚Äô Johnson - like many details reported about Stonewall, this is simply untrue, in fact she said herself that she did not arrive at the bar until the raids had already begun! There are still many claims as to ‚Äòwho threw the first brick‚Äô - many of which not only disagree on WHO threw it, but they disagree on WHAT was even thrown! Regardless, Marsha P. Johnson‚Äôs legacy is still extremely important and she became one of the most vocal activists in the struggle for gay & transgender rights.
Johnson was a black, self described transvestite (transgender was not a widely used term at the time); gay and a drag queen and used she/her pronouns. In an interview in 1989, talking about the riots she said they were a protest against police brutality and harassment against the LGBT+ community - sentiments that are widely echoed today in the BLM campaign.
Following Stonewall, Marsha went on to become a leader in the LGBT+ liberation movement, she was central to the formation of the Gay Liberation Front and, in 1970, she established S.T.A.R - an organisation that was set up with the aim of specifically helping the trans community; a community that was often rejected or left behind by gay rights groups. S.T.A.R then went on to set up a home for homeless LGBT+ youth in New York. In addition to this, Marsha was a huge activist for those that were affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis, despite huge stigma.
Sadly, she suffered from significant mental health problems throughout her life; her body was later found in the Hudson River in 1992, 6 days after she was reported missing. Despite the suspicious circumstances of her death, the police declared it as a suicide and it was never investigated. Many people within the gay community at the time disputed this and the investigation was reopened in 2012. It remains unsolved.
The Stonewall riots symbolised a catalyst for change; they began the gay liberation movement yet also showed an end of a dying conservative or traditionalist era. Before the riots, LGBT+ individuals had never broadcasted their sexual orientation or identity, but the event stimulated the gay community and thus sparked greater political activism.","The Catalyst (Part 2/2)
#BristruthsPride
It is widely documented that one of the people who was responsible for the start of this riot was Marsha ‚ÄòPay no mind‚Äô Johnson - like many details reported about Stonewall, this is simply untrue, in fact she said herself that she did not arrive at the bar until the raids had already begun! There are still many claims as to ‚Äòwho threw the first brick‚Äô - many of which not only disagree on WHO threw it, but they disagree on WHAT was even thrown! Regardless, Marsha P. Johnson‚Äôs legacy is still extremely important and she became one of the most vocal activists in the struggle for gay & transgender rights.

The university sending an email to show their support for BLM is better than them staying silent. We'd say they were exercising their privilege by not making a stance for the movement. In fact, you saying that it's hypocritical that they're showing support because the university was built off the slave trade can be applied to a lot of people that show their support today. I don't think those people or the university today want to be the benefactors of the slave trade, unfortunately they just are and they're moving in the right direction to do something about it.
And yes, they probably can and should do more, but that's a different argument. I'm just defending people who are at least acting positively for the movement; they shouldn't be attacked, they should be encouraged. A negative attitude won't get people on side as much as a positive attitude will.","#Bristruth29489

In absolute shock at some of the ignorant posts i‚Äôve seen about sympathy for Boris? To feel sympathy for this man is honestly just evidence that you‚Äôve completely neglected the news and choose to be blind to every fatal mistake that he‚Äôs made leaving us with the highest death toll in Europe. Boris missed FIVE cobra meetings about COVID-19. He then put in place a suggested ‚Äòstay at home‚Äô while leaving pubs and clubs open? He raved about shaking hands with COVID-19 patients in one of his daily briefings and did not enforce lockdown until far too late. He DIDN‚ÄôT put in place the fact that people arriving on planes would need to quarantine until May and has literally only just made it necessary to wear face coverings on public transport in June? This is literally only about 1% of his mistakes? Everything people are praising Boris on doing, the rest of Europe has been doing much better? It is honestly painful that you have so much respect for such an awful leader. Do your research. AND ONE MORE THING - saying Dominic Cummings was ‚Äòdoing what any parent would do‚Äô when he drove his child across the country while his wife was suspected of having rona, I expect you all have this same energy when immigrants travel miles to free their children from war torn countries and awful home situations and if not seriously re-evaluate your morals.
Just because your parents tell you Boris is a good leader, take some initiative and do your own research and read the news it‚Äôs literally clear as day he is Dominic Cummings puppet master and just a terrible leader.","#Bristruth29487

Waitrose: Conservatives. quite expensive and they include things like champagne flutes in their waitrose essentials range. Need I say more?

RE #Bristruth29308 and anyone else in an awful position for housing next year
I was able to secure a flat very late last year and I can recommend a few things:
Find numbers for letting agents and landlords, call them directly and ask about properties. Enquiring online won‚Äôt get you anywhere quickly enough at this stage. Try contacting SU lettings and digs to ask about anything that‚Äôs come up.
Join Facebook groups- Bristol Uni housemate finder + Bristol housing, room and flat share, and even some ticket pages. If you‚Äôre finding somewhere on your own you would likely be able to find a room going.
Don‚Äôt be afraid to move further out of the city. It‚Äôs not ideal, but weigh up a bus ride with living somewhere shocking for a year if you have to. Look at places like Filton with regular buses","#Bristruth29361

Is a refund reasonable?
I am definitely supportive of the cause, but the number of angry, demaning articles, headlines and facebook posts makes me feel obligated to speak out on this topic.
As an MSc student I am no stranger to the struggles of paying 9 grand a year for what is currently a bit of a shit show of a degree, but before we go throwing accusations around I think people should consider what they are asking for. The university has already frozen all non-essential spending and is doing all the can to preserve money to keep the lights on, including a freeze on hiring which leaves them in a problematic spot for coping with staff on sick leave etc. They are looking at significant debt over the next few years that will surpass the tens of millions.
On top of that, our lecturers are still working their full contracts trying to give is any semblance of the same quality of education we deserve. Many are infact working significant unpaid overtime hours to compensate for the need to completely redesign courses, exams and design next years syllabus' and teaching styles online. So when you demand a refund for your discomfort and annoyance, please consider what you're actually asking... where do you think the money is coming from? Who will suffer and why do you feel so entitled? Please respect that the staff are still working their hardest for us so the least we can do is treat them with equivalent respect and understanding.","#Bristruth29338

For many of us, June is a special month, not just because of exams (although we‚Äôre as excited as you are) but because it is LGBT+ Pride month. It is a chance for people of all ages, gender identities, and backgrounds to celebrate inclusion and openness. Whoever we are, and whoever we love; pride allows us to celebrate the amazing achievements we have made in the fight for equality. It highlights the problems and injustices we still face, as well as the amazing work that people all over the world do to achieve a more equal society.
The last week has seen a horrifying event take place in the United States. One that has triggered protests all over the globe, protests whose sole aim is justice and equality. These values are at the core of pride and for that reason Bristruths wants to start pride month by highlighting the work of BME LGBT+ activists, and the work they are doing to bring justice and equality to communities all over the world.
We have a number of exciting things planned over the coming month. This will include discussing the origins of pride; what we now consider to be a celebration that was originally born from violent protest at a New York bar and club. These protests were the catalyst for a huge change of policy and attitude towards the LGBT+ community.
We hope this campaign helps to educate as well as celebrate our amazing community and we look forward to sharing those stories with you.

Mario Kart DS Items Ranking
Top Tier
1)Triple Red Shells:
Best item hands down, a direct hit each time and can bring you up 3 places as well as protecting you
2)Red Shell:
Direct hit each time allows for a 95% chance of overtaking the person in front of you
every time
3)Bullet Bill:
When you‚Äôre in the depths of the last places this bad boy can get you to a high mid table position or even 3rd place, whilst empathically knocking over the people in front of you
Good tier
4)Star:
15 seconds of pure euphoria, increased pace, immortality to any item, object or opponent in your way. A shame it can‚Äôt last a bit longer
5)Spiny blue shell:
This is given to you at the bottom half of the table but can spoil the party of the leader, especially at crucial times. The ultimate ‚ÄòIf I‚Äôm going down, you‚Äôre going down with me‚Äô item
6)Triple mushrooms:
Triple boost of acceleration can be useful to get you in a good position, help you extend your lead or help you recover. Also removes the ink from your screen
7)Bob-omb:
Very good item when it lands where you want it, can leave opponents dazed for quite a while. However can sometimes go easily wrong and you end up bombing yourself
Average Tier
8)Triple green shells:
I mean only useful for protection against other items. The lack of accuracy in aim means you can rarely hit someone unless you‚Äôre right behind them
9)Golden mushroom:
You‚Äôd think unlimited acceleration would be amazing but it‚Äôs usually given when doing very bad in last place. Can help you get to mid table but runs out real quick
10)Lightning :
An okay little zinger, that removes everyone‚Äôs items in front of you and dazes them. However, it affects majority of leaders so everyone is in the same boat so little changes. Can only overtake the person in front of you really, plus the people behind you are unaffected.
11)Triple bananas:
Useful for protection but that‚Äôs it really. If planted well can get some opponents and daze them but rarely gets people as can be seen from a mile away
12)Mushroom:
Good quick boost of acceleration, can remove ink, but nothing more than that. Short and Sweet
Shite Tier
12)Banana:
Only useful is carefully well planted, otherwise useless as can be seen from a mile away and opponents can easily swerve
13)Blooper ink thing
Pretty fucking useless, yeah people can‚Äôt see their screens fully but no one slows down and it can be nullified by a mushroom or an accelerator on the track. Also affects majority of leaders so everyone is the same and little changes
14)Green shell
The absolute worst item. There‚Äôs a reason why 1st place always gets it because you can‚Äôt fucking do anything to advance yourself. Can‚Äôt protect yourself with it, no direct hit on an opponent, a 5% chance of you actually hitting an opponent","#Bristruth28727

Ranking of Bristol Live Music Venues
8) Vic Rooms - it would be sick if they could remove the chairs and welcome different genres, but the only gigs that aren't prohibitively expensive are student classical ensembles/ occasional jazz (even these cost more than the average Bristol gig). The whole place should really be more accommodating to music that isn't read out of books
7) Mr Wolf's - this may surprise many of you, but wolfs has earned the place of second to last because it's not big enough for its own hype. If you give up on trying to get a good view, you end up getting pissed on cheap thatchers and act more rowdy than anyone reasonably can be when watching bujo stand there awkwardly and play music that's way cooler than they'll ever be (sorry bujo). The only escape is the smoking area where you can watch posh freshers smoke malboroughs and listen to them chat philosophical bollocks at bored yet polite locals.
6) Thekla - always further away than you expect, too many middle-aged men standing at the peripheries or behind the netting on the top deck, and the novelty of being on a boat wears off quicker than you expect. However, pretty well ventilated, and smoking on a boat is nice, when it's not raining.
5) The Fleece - tribute bands play here almost every night, but in between there are some occasional great gigs. You can get a fair view from pretty much anywhere, feels purpose built for live music. Almost makes up for the fact that the floor is unbelievably sticky, and the bar staff are mean.
4) O2 Academy - difficult to get a good spot, and you'll encounter at least a few pissed locals who don't seem to know where they are or care. However, great sound system, you'll have a great time if you reach the front, and you can get a 2 pint beer which fuels a great deal of enthusiasm.
3) The Louisiana - tiny, secluded, with a big age range in the gig attendees. If you follow any small UK based artists a lot of them will stop off here on a small tour. Some gigs will flop but tickets are often cheap and the community vibe is very nice.
2) Rough Trade - another pretty small venue, hosts artists of the up-and-coming variety, like a radio 1 dj's favourite new artist or something. Less often older people here, which just means the atmosphere is a bit less up-tight and there's more dancing and flailing. Good moshing can be found here.
1) Stokes Croft (crofters rights, canteen, social, leftbank) - brilliant places to see local artists, fusion jams and alternative djs. Watch a rapper stand up, grab the mic and go into a lyrical trance while the band blasts some disco funk fire. Stand barely a foot away from these geniuses creating music in the moment, feel your body move with the rhythm, look across and wave at that outlandish character that started talking to you at the bar, who's wiggling around with a bottle of desperados in their hand. The vibe is real nice always. P. S. these pubs are better versions of wolfs, don't @ me.","#Bristruth28723

Unlike in a normal physical meeting, members of the public will not be allowed to sit in and make an in person statement and thanks to the lock-down we are not able to hold a physical demonstration.

Over the past two weeks we‚Äôve had an incredible team of builders come on board to help us make this project a reality. As you can see, they did not disappoint. We have built: Wills Meme-orial Building, Hugh Brady, Senate House, Queen‚Äôs, the ASS, MVB, Cabot tower, and Lounge! Special thanks to Bristol University Computer Science Society and Bristol MineSoc for their help setting things up.
This will be a community run server and will be hosted for the next couple of months to keep us busy. To kick things off we will be having a livestream and server tour at 6pm today. Tomorrow we will be hosting an Easter Egg hunt! More details to come shortly.

Being stuck at home with my family is making me miss my friends way too much so here is the rating no one asked for of all the different kinds of uni friendships:
Halls Friends: Your friendship with these people could have been so different had you panic signed on a house with them in November of first year, back then they were your closest friends. You‚Äôd constantly be reminding each other that this year didn‚Äôt count so you could go out for a fourth time that week and spend the entire Saturday in the Hall canteen only getting up to switch your breakfast tray for lunch. Now they‚Äôre people you see a few times a month in the pub or at prees. Will maybe keep in contact with half for a couple of years before it dwindles down to one or two. 6/10.
Housemates: You may argue a lot because one of them doesn‚Äôt understand the concept of taking out the bins but really you love these people like a second family and are constantly texting them the second you get back to your actual family. There‚Äôs no one else you‚Äôd rather spend a year or two with working out how to make a roast in a tiny student kitchen that was last cleaned when your parents came to visit, before giving up and ordering yet another dominos. You already have holidays/ travel plans with these people or planned to live together in London before none of you got a grad job. 10/10.
Same school same uni :On results day you‚Äôd make a group chat titled ‚Äú(school name) goes to Bristol!!‚Äù and you spend the rest of august sporadically texting them to ask what halls they‚Äôd applied to. In first term you‚Äôd make plans to go to the pub that would never happen, and you‚Äôd hug them whenever you saw them out saying that this time you would actually meet up. Sometimes they would actually get integrated into your uni life but for most cases by second year you‚Äôd maybe still stop and chat every time you saw them in the ASS but by third year it‚Äôs a quick nod, and sometimes you even look the other way so you don‚Äôt even have to bother with that. 3/10.
Friend you hook up with: This was just a normal friendship but you always thought they were quite fit. Then after too many VKs in lounge you woke up with them in your bed wondering whether it be weird if you had morning after sex. Neither of you tell your mutual friends until the next trip to the pub when it comes out and you swear that it can never happen again but now that it‚Äôs happened once it keeps happening. Either ends up with one of you getting feelings and getting rejected so a weird atmosphere in the group or one of those cute relationships that everyone else is jealous of. 5/10 or 9/10 depending on ending.
Sports team: Friendships made through early morning/late night training hit different, and you‚Äôll never miss a Wednesday night in grav with them. You‚Äôll always remember that you were the year that means Browns won‚Äôt let your team have their Christmas meal there again and your fleeces represent your friendship just as much as your team. Rating would have been higher except for that one time one of them made you drink piss. 8/10.
Friend you don‚Äôt like but everyone else inexplicably does: These people have always been in your friendship group and you can never work out why. They always look annoyed on a night out and just seem to be rude about everyone. Whenever someone asks if you‚Äôre friends you just kinda awkwardly laugh and don‚Äôt answer the question. Will never talk or think about again after graduation. 1/10.
Course mates: When you suffer through hungover 9ams or 5 hour labs together a close bond is formed. You actually know how to spend extended periods of time with them without alcohol and even though your degree may be boring 90% of the time you do actually share the same interests/ career aspirations as them which adds a lot to the friendship .You‚Äôll be annoyed when the night before the deadline one of them asks to see your lab report because they haven‚Äôt started yet, but ultimately you‚Äôre always going to help them. By third year you will love these people and definitely owe part of your 2:1 to them. 8/10.","#Bristruth28229

@ the email circulating by a concerned law student
As a fellow law student, I wish to applaud your initiative and courage for writing the email. I would not have the courage as you do hence I am utilising the platform of Bristruths to convey this message. I sincerely hope you‚Äôre feeling better and the best of health to you and your family during these difficult times.
I wish to put across an opinion, perhaps unpopular, that the email was fairly presumptuous and self-entitled. In particular, you proposed that the law school would prioritise your well-being by cancelling exams, yet you urge the school to not jeopardise your degree that you‚Äôve spent 3 years on.
I believe by cancelling the exam, not only will it jeopardise the degree you implored the school not to, it will have rippling effect onto further years in the form of Bristol Law School‚Äôs ranking, should Bristol be the only law school to do so.
You‚Äôve further criticised the school to stop being a follower and become a leader.
While I can only presume this, I believe as with any institution ,especially one such as the Russel Group, Bristol‚Äôs executive team are heavily bound by the decisions of the Russel Group executives and have minimum sway in the matter.
Although I whole-heartedly agree that the school can definitely step up their responses and measures in times like this, I personally think you projected a heavy bias by making the letter publicly personal.
Some of us do not want the exams to be cancelled. Some of us do. The fact that you drafted a public email that will undoubtedly gather a significant number of traction and will lead the school to assume that the latter holds true.
Online assessments are currently a fair way that the school has proposed to balance both the worth of the degree that you treasure as well as your well-being. If you truly wish for your painstaking degree not to be jeopardise, I‚Äôd suggest reconsidering your proposal to cancel exams entirely.","#Bristruth28008

Inspired by #Bristruth27809 I'm taking it upon myself to also bring you some quality (+somewhat simpler) film reviews as a non-film student starting with‚Ä¶
Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011) - Independent Drama/Mystery
Starring: Elizabeth Olsen (Ingrid Goes West, Wind River, Sorry for Your Loss, Marvel Cinematic Universe) and Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story, Oceans 8, Glass)
Director: Sean Durkin
The plot focuses on a young woman suffering from delusions and paranoia after returning to her family from an abusive cult in the Catskill Mountains.
What a breakthrough for Elizabeth Olsen. Having already fell in love with her work listed above I was keen to explore her other films. Her performance as Martha is completely mesmerizing as she perfectly depicts a young girl scarred by the events of her past in a tasteful, subtle way. The look in her puppy-dog eyes really makes you feel for her and you pity the way she has lost all sense of normality in the film. Sarah Paulson's work in the film, although in a lesser role, is equally as endearing, with her unique voice and facial expressions blasting her emotions out as she attempts to untangle and deal with the strange repercussions of her sister's psychological trauma.
The film itself does very well to explore the topic of a cult where rules are twisted and bent into manipulations - making sure to portray a highly realistic yet haunting story as you follow each scene which is laced with uncomfortable events and the inevitable consequences which follow.
The tension is high throughout (as it should be in a thriller) which is a delicious contrast to the somewhat calm ambience the music and photography seems to convey. With a quiet yet startling ending, this film is definitely worth a watch.

Since I‚Äôm stuck in my room for the next month in quarantine, I‚Äôve decided to put my film degree to use and so I‚Äôm going to review a film a day for you guys to help you decide what you watch as the world collapses. The first film I‚Äôve chosen is Lost in Translation:
Lost in Translations as a film originally was lost on me; having heard so many raving reviews, to say I was disappointed I think would be fair but I feel it‚Äôs one of those films which come to you after the viewing. The film follows two people, Charlotte and Bob, who are lost in their lives seeing change and confusion. Bob Has been married for 25 years with two children which is shown to have lost its flame while also dealing with being an actor that is no longer in many films anymore and rather working in advertising a Japanese whisky. The irony of this in casting Murray is not lost however as the title might suggest as Murray in real life could only be seen as very similar. While Charlotte has just finished studying philosophy in Yale, marrying a photographer who is out in Japan shooting at band with her unsure about her new marriage.
The film shows absence in a way I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen before with both characters showing absence from their surroundings separated from the city and people through a language barrier and often shown in their rooms when alone looking out their windows over Tokyo as if it is almost too much to take in. Often when travelling out into the city with Charlotte we are given a hugely loud and confusing environment with the arcade showing loud music and her watching over people but never joining in. When at temples, she watches over monks but never communicates or involves herself. However, when she does, like with the flower decorating, the barrier becomes unimportant because human connection becomes more important, although she can‚Äôt understand what the woman helping her is saying, the connection between her and the woman causes her feel less lost and welcome into the city for one of the first times. I love the shots from both characters when they are walking through crowds of people with the camera only focussing on them. It leaves them so isolated from everyone else, giving a real sense of their isolation in a huge city.
The isolation in a huge city I think it also one thing that makes the ending so huge. As Bob leaves, he sees Charlotte and gets out the cab to talk to her before he goes. The dramatic chase is not there as one might expect but they found eachother in the city and helped eachother feel less lonely. The chances of him finding her before he left was so small, reminding us of the luck they had in order to find eachother in the first place. The ending in itself feels anti-climatic, we expect Bob to chase after Charlotte and confess his unequivocal love to her; I was expecting an ending like Manhattan by Woody Allen. However, the whisper we never hear and him leaving afterwards feels wrong but I think it‚Äôs the perfect ending to a film all about loneliness as they share their final words in their friendship (idk if it was just a friendship tbf) with us left out, causing us to question what Bob says but truth is, it‚Äôs not for us to know as we are merely a spectator on their relationship, reminding us that, although we haven‚Äôt seen it form, we ourselves our isolated from their relationship and we‚Äôre only there to watch it.
The film focusses on the importance of experiences with everyone but the two main characters surrounded by an excess of materialistic objects. Many of the arcade games, like the one with the drums, take traditional Japanese instruments and exposes it to capitalism while Charlotte goes to see the temples and traditional Japanese life, causing it to feel that many Japanese people may have lost their own culture to that of capitalism. Bob‚Äôs wife is obsessed with carpets sending him samples with the irony that they are all different shades of burgundy that look exactly the same. One of the most important scenes is when Bob is in the bath with on call with his wife who says they are out of stock of the burgundy carpet. Bob shows no care telling her to choose the carpet with her being lost in what he means. It showed the difference between the two as Bob realised his life was unhealthy but his wife doesn‚Äôt seem to understand or listen to him, too distracted by the world around her. The exact same thing happens to Charlotte as she calls a friend trying to explain her loss of self and struggles in her marriage to a friend for them not to listen. What‚Äôs important about Bob and Charlotte‚Äôs relationship is they listen to eachother with the scene where the romantic couple would usually consummate saw them just talking with Charlotte talking about her confusion on what to do and Bob telling her to keep writing, reassuring her he‚Äôs confident that whatever she does, she will be ok. It does make me laugh that I have only got around to just watching this film now with every time someone tells me to watch it, I always say I‚Äôm too busy but maybe that‚Äôs something Coppola was aiming for.
One thing that did wrong I think was the comedy through Japan‚Äôs culture and people often leave them as the joke due to their language and often acting as caricatures such as that of the escort with his mispronunciation of rip and also of the photographer being unable to pronounce Roger Moore properly. I think if you were Japanese, it could he seen as culturally insensitive to a certain degree and the joke, ironically, could be lost in translation as it seems like they are the runt of the joke. I think this occurred due to Coppola herself also being an outsider and therefore possibly not quite getting the culture herself with sometimes feeling like the film itself is alienated from the country it‚Äôs filmed in (but I get that‚Äôs the point to some degree). As referred to earlier, I think Manhattan (Woody Allen) did a similar thing to this film but didn‚Äôt cause the city to feel so alienated and so possibly did better job for me there. I would wonder what this film would be like if it was filmed from a director from Japan or possibly even Tokyo, I‚Äôm sure much of the humour wouldn‚Äôt have been so western suited. The film I think it would have probably ended up like Fallen Angels (Wong Kar Wai).
Overall Lost in Translation is a beautiful film, it talks about some things so subtly which makes it so amazing but it is a very western and, even more so, American film in the way it deals with culture of other countries and I couldn‚Äôt myself get behind it. I found much of the comedy for me fell flat due to this. I will have to come back to this film at some point. When I‚Äôm not too busy.

I love the shots from both characters when they are walking through crowds of people with the camera only focussing on them. It leaves them so isolated from everyone else, giving a real sense of their isolation in a huge city.
The isolation in a huge city I think it also one thing that makes the ending so huge. As Bob leaves, he sees Charlotte and gets out the cab to talk to her before he goes. The dramatic chase is not there as one might expect but they found eachother in the city and helped eachother feel less lonely. The chances of him finding her before he left was so small, reminding us of the luck they had in order to find eachother in the first place. The ending in itself feels anti-climatic, we expect Bob to chase after Charlotte and confess his unequivocal love to her; I was expecting an ending like Manhattan by Woody Allen. However, the whisper we never hear and him leaving afterwards feels wrong but I think it‚Äôs the perfect ending to a film all about loneliness as they share their final words in their friendship (idk if it was just a friendship tbf) with us left out, causing us to question what Bob says but truth is, it‚Äôs not for us to know as we are merely a spectator on their relationship, reminding us that, although we haven‚Äôt seen it form, we ourselves our isolated from their relationship and we‚Äôre only there to watch it.
The film focusses on the importance of experiences with everyone but the two main characters surrounded by an excess of materialistic objects. Many of the arcade games, like the one with the drums, take traditional Japanese instruments and exposes it to capitalism while Charlotte goes to see the temples and traditional Japanese life, causing it to feel that many Japanese people may have lost their own culture to that of capitalism. Bob‚Äôs wife is obsessed with carpets sending him samples with the irony that they are all different shades of burgundy that look exactly the same. One of the most important scenes is when Bob is in the bath with on call with his wife who says they are out of stock of the burgundy carpet. Bob shows no care telling her to choose the carpet with her being lost in what he means. It showed the difference between the two as Bob realised his life was unhealthy but his wife doesn‚Äôt seem to understand or listen to him, too distracted by the world around her. The exact same thing happens to Charlotte as she calls a friend trying to explain her loss of self and struggles in her marriage to a friend for them not to listen. What‚Äôs important about Bob and Charlotte‚Äôs relationship is they listen to eachother with the scene where the romantic couple would usually consummate saw them just talking with Charlotte talking about her confusion on what to do and Bob telling her to keep writing, reassuring her he‚Äôs confident that whatever she does, she will be ok. It does make me laugh that I have only got around to just watching this film now with every time someone tells me to watch it, I always say I‚Äôm too busy but maybe that‚Äôs something Coppola was aiming for.
One thing that did wrong I think was the comedy through Japan‚Äôs culture and people often leave them as the joke due to their language and often acting as caricatures such as that of the escort with his mispronunciation of rip and also of the photographer being unable to pronounce Roger Moore properly. I think if you were Japanese, it could he seen as culturally insensitive to a certain degree and the joke, ironically, could be lost in translation as it seems like they are the runt of the joke. I think this occurred due to Coppola herself also being an outsider and therefore possibly not quite getting the culture herself with sometimes feeling like the film itself is alienated from the country it‚Äôs filmed in (but I get that‚Äôs the point to some degree). As referred to earlier, I think Manhattan (Woody Allen) did a similar thing to this film but didn‚Äôt cause the city to feel so alienated and so possibly did better job for me there. I would wonder what this film would be like if it was filmed from a director from Japan or possibly even Tokyo, I‚Äôm sure much of the humour wouldn‚Äôt have been so western suited. The film I think it would have probably ended up like Fallen Angels (Wong Kar Wai).
Overall Lost in Translation is a beautiful film, it talks about some things so subtly which makes it so amazing but it is a very western and, even more so, American film in the way it deals with culture of other countries and I couldn‚Äôt myself get behind it. I found much of the comedy for me fell flat due to this. I will have to come back to this film at some point. When I‚Äôm not too busy.

Hi guys, it's Rory!
The other one, running for Sports and Student Development. I've been on a sports club committee for 3 years (club captain for 1), so I know what the SU can realistically get done with its budget and resources. I have been endorsed by Women's football, Women's rugby, Archery, Cheerleading, Squash and American Football! Have a read of my manifesto, it's focussed on student wellbeing, participation, competition and community, and please follow me on Facebook and Instagram @rory4ssd for all my campaign information!
Have a great day and #VoteRory.","#Bristruth27596

Definitive rankings of SU campaign videos:
God Tier:
Obviously the Bristruths campaign video - it tackles some of the most prominent issues we students face altogether, and more importantly, by putting it in god tier it will undoubtedly get posted (pls admins I need the validation)
Good Tier:
Despite not really knowing what she stands for, Cordelia had some pretty good bars in her vid without coming off as completely desperate. The cinematography of it all was also quite enjoyable
Okay Tier:
Ostin started off really strong with that deep male voice in the opening verse but for me it kinda fizzled throughout the chorus. Least he got his message across though
Shit Tier:
No disrespect, David's video has provided me with some good laughs, moreso than the other two. He gets all the points he's made in his manifesto but the whole 'vogue' thing seems very try-hard, resulting in it being the most cringy thing I've ever seen. While the slightly choreographed dance is appreciated, the vocals really let it down too.

WHAT YOUR FAVOURITE CLUB SAYS ABOUT YOU:
Lizard Lounge:
Classic Bristol student. You‚Äôre always up for a laugh and a boogie with your best mates. You drink until you black out but don‚Äôt care. Never shut up about how much you love lounge. Dance like nobody‚Äôs watching.
Gravity:
Happy person. Lives off VK‚Äôs. You like cheesey hits and chart music. Always go to the events with the BTEC celebs but don‚Äôt care because it adds to the night. Have probably made drunk friends with the lollipop lady at some point.
Lakota:
Absolute sesh gremlin. Nothing you love more than a wavey one at wide eyes with your mates. Got used to the comedowns. Have probably discovered the meaning of life by staring at the fire pit. Basically came to Bris for skins.
SWX:
You always buy j√§ger bombs for everyone despite the mad prices. You‚Äôre never really in the room you want to be because you‚Äôve followed your friends but are usually too drunk to care. Will always go out for a cheeky drunk cig despite saying you don‚Äôt smoke.
Pryzm:
Keep it casual. Probably met Tracy Beaker and say it was the best night of your life. Always down for a disco on the top floor. Very positive person. Will always compliment a strangers outfit.
Blue Mountain:
Probably too drugged up to read this. Fear nothing not even God. Live and breathe drum and bass. Complete mess in their every day life. Sobriety? I don‚Äôt know him.
Thekla:
You try to dress unique just like every other indie kid in Bristol. Harmlessly happy clubber. Some of the best people you‚Äôll meet. Secretly wishes they‚Äôre from Manchester solely for the music. GOD BLESS THE BAND! +10 indie points see you with a dark fruits and bucket hat.
Motion:
You do like nights out but only with a reason. Only really go for the acts. Not fazed by the prices because you don‚Äôt know any different. Probably like house and dnb. Got shouted at for going into a toilet stall with 2+ people.","#Bristruth27471

Let me tell you a story about a girl. A girl who is still a stranger to me but one who I long to be closer to. A girl who everyone passes everyday without a second glance. A girl who ultimately deserves better. For the purposes of this story I'll call her 'Grace'.
In first year I barely knew of Grace's existence. I would hear people talking about her but I never really got the chance to learn more about her or even meet her. This all changed in second year when I moved into a house that was fairly close to hers.
We would see each other everyday and would share a quick friendly smile, simply acknowledging the fact that we were neighbours. This was fine at the beginning but everday I started to want more and more from this relationship.
So I finally found the courage to talk to her. And this is where my world flipped upside down. Grace was more than I could have ever expected. She was warm, friendly, kind, and most importantly, completely accepting of me.
I've made a mistake though and I haven't talked to Grace as much as I want to. Even when I'm with other girls, I start thinking about how great a person Grace is. So this is my promise:
Grace Reeves, I promise to study more inside you.","#Bristruth27284

Bristruths Wellbeing Review
Bristruths
February 10 at 12:00 PM ¬∑
Over the next two weeks, Bristruths will be running a ‚ÄúWellbeing Review‚Äù of Bristol University with supporting work from Epigram. The goal of this review is to gather positive and negative stories of wellbeing at Bristol. This could be to do with course stress, depression, loneliness, or any other aspect of uni life that affects people‚Äôs mental health. We want to hear your experiences of wellbeing, where you think the University is doing well, and where you think it could improve.
We will be running two submission points for people to share their stories. The first will be a regular submission page. Here, people should anonymously submit content. The second submission point will be a google form with an included field for a university email.
At the end of the two week period two things will happen. Firstly, Epigram will contact a selection of people from the Google form submissions that we‚Äôll share with them. They will interview them and publish their stories, anonymously if preferred, in print or online. Secondly, all anonymous submissions will be delivered by hand to University Senior Management in both printed form and a single electronic copy. Please submit to both submission points if you wish to be a part of both actions.
We are aware that content of this nature is highly confidential. Only one Bristruth admin and one Epigram editor will have access to the submissions. Once the Epigram editor has chosen people to contact, a small selection of the team will be involved in the interviewing and writing process. Submitting on the Google form still allows you to remain anonymous in any Epigram articles. At the end of the project, all submissions will be deleted.
None of these submissions will be posted to Facebook.
On a final note, we are not doing this to try and draw a target on the University. We are looking for people to provide examples of where services have been a success, as well as constructive criticism where the University needs improvement. Importantly, we want these to be personal stories, something that can‚Äôt be told through boxes on a survey.
Thank you for being a part of this project.

As inspired by the legends that have come before me I present a review of the SU water fountains, starting with:
Link Space 1:
Flow Rate: 1.5 litres/minute, nothing to write home about but plenty of time to eye fuck the occupants of the link space. (6.5/10)
Cleanliness: Your average water fountain grime, not enough to make you find an alternative. (7/10)
Location: Nice and close to most of the attractions to be found in the SU (not sure what they are?) (8/10)
Fountain: No fountain to speak of here, water bottles only, very disappointing. (0/10)
Taste: Good quality Bristol water, bit cloudy as flow begins. Chilled water would be nice. (7.5/10)
Overall: It‚Äôs probably the flagship water fountain of the SU due to its location and so an overall rating of (5.8/10) is rather disappointing. Add to this the fact it has only recently been repaired because of the graduation ceremony and well I‚Äôve got a rather sour after taste.
Rankings:

2613636638857668,"Over the next two weeks, Bristruths will be running a ‚ÄúWellbeing Review‚Äù of Bristol University with supporting work from Epigram. The goal of this review is to gather positive and negative stories of wellbeing at Bristol. This could be to do with course stress, depression, loneliness, or any other aspect of uni life that affects people‚Äôs mental health. We want to hear your experiences of wellbeing, where you think the University is doing well, and where you think it could improve.
We will be running two submission points for people to share their stories. The first will be a regular submission page. Here, people should anonymously submit content. The second submission point will be a google form with an included field for a university email.
At the end of the two week period two things will happen. Firstly, Epigram will contact a selection of people from the Google form submissions that we‚Äôll share with them. They will interview them and publish their stories, anonymously if preferred, in print or online. Secondly, all anonymous submissions will be delivered by hand to University Senior Management in both printed form and a single electronic copy. Please submit to both submission points if you wish to be a part of both actions.
We are aware that content of this nature is highly confidential. Only one Bristruth admin and one Epigram editor will have access to the submissions. Once the Epigram editor has chosen people to contact, a small selection of the team will be involved in the interviewing and writing process. Submitting on the Google form still allows you to remain anonymous in any Epigram articles. At the end of the project, all submissions will be deleted.
None of these submissions will be posted to Facebook.
On a final note, we are not doing this to try and draw a target on the University. We are looking for people to provide examples of where services have been a success, as well as constructive criticism where the University needs improvement. Importantly, we want these to be personal stories, something that can‚Äôt be told through boxes on a survey.
Thank you for being a part of this project.

Bristruths Wellbeing Review","Over the next two weeks, Bristruths will be running a ‚ÄúWellbeing Review‚Äù of Bristol University with supporting work from Epigram. The goal of this review is to gather positive and negative stories of wellbeing at Bristol. This could be to do with course stress, depression, loneliness, or any other aspect of uni life that affects people‚Äôs mental health. We want to hear your experiences of wellbeing, where you think the University is doing well, and where you think it could improve.
We will be running two submission points for people to share their stories. The first will be a regular submission page. Here, people should anonymously submit content. The second submission point will be a google form with an included field for a university email.
At the end of the two week period two things will happen. Firstly, Epigram will contact a selection of people from the Google form submissions that we‚Äôll share with them. They will interview them and publish their stories, anonymously if preferred, in print or online. Secondly, all anonymous submissions will be delivered by hand to University Senior Management in both printed form and a single electronic copy.

Inspired by the library reviews, however not being quite as studious, this six nations season we have decided to watch the rugby in a different pub every day. And so here begins the six nations pub rankings of 2020
England vs. France ‚Äì W. G. Grace
1. Seats ‚Äì plenty of them as long as you‚Äôre willing to play a bit of musical chairs to get a decent view
2. View ‚Äì other than the odd pillar we can‚Äôt complain. A big enough screen for even the poor sighted, but only the one screen for the whole pub
3. Aesthetics ‚Äì classic spoons feel with sticky tables and old ikea furniture, however a slightly more modern twist. Very comforting and pleasant
4. Food ‚Äì It‚Äôs spoons. If you don‚Äôt know the answer to this one then please culture yourself
5. Guinness Price ‚Äì at an incredible ¬£3.39, this is the place to go if you want a pint that won‚Äôt break the bank. But be warned, the way it was poured looks like us after a rough night in lizard lounge
6. Score satisfaction ‚Äì mixed reviews from our team. 24-17 at full time so at least an improvement from England. Ended with a cheer from our Welsh and Irish components but a grim face from our English reviewer.
7. Eye candy ‚Äì there was someone for everyone ‚Äì both locals and students sharing the excitement. A fair few boys in their rugby gear caught our eyes (hello boys) and a lot of your classic, edgy Bristol students. However, some lads with a poor understanding of the rugby brought the average down ‚Äì he‚Äôs called Nigel not Hugh Owens (you know who you are)
Overall, we would rate the W. G. Grace 7.5/10
Standings:

It happened. It actually happened. The moment that I hoped would never come but always knew lay in my future at this University. The question now is: is this a one of occurrence or will I suffer the same pain that I felt today again? I walked in late to a lecture, this afternoon, and sat there to figure out if it was mine. It wasn't.
Panicked and fueled by caffeine, I burst through the doors in the front of the lecture theatre, only to catch a glimpse of a decisively less Chinese class than I'm used to. As I hastily slid onto the nearest seat, the eyes of hundreds of students burned into the back of my head. Did they know that I wasn't meant to be there? Was there anyone that I knew in the class? How long had the class been going on for? Question upon question flowed through my mind as it became absorbed further and further into itself. My almost trance like state was only broken as the lecturer asked ""can you please discuss some of your ideas with the people around you"". Fear shot through my body.
I know what you are thinking. ""Oh god, he didn't try to discuss the topic with the students that are actually taking the course did he""? No.
I whipped out my phone as a comforting presence, as any person in my generation does when presented with an awkward situation. This aided me twofold. Not only was my anxious mind immediately soothed somewhat, but this gave the unmistakable signal to the rest of the cohort that I was not here for a chit chat. This bought me some time to think. As I looked up from my phone, a student walked past. ""Of course"" I thought to myself. ""Sneak away while you have the chance and they will forget you were ever here"". Being the 6' 3"", 120kg person I am, I'm sure no one even noticed in the first place...
I hope this bought some much needed entertainment to the somewhat self-explanatory lecture that it seemed to be.","#Bristruth26724

Degrees as types of bread
English -> white bread. Very simple, plain, standard. Versatile. Generally regarded as alright by everyone, however thinks they are more loved than they universally are. People who love it LOVE it. Won‚Äôt have any other kind of bread, won‚Äôt do any other kind of degree. In direct conflict with....
Medicine/Engineering/Maths -> brown bread. A healthier choice (for consuming and for job prospects in this modern world). Not for everyone, but again, those who champion brown bread will fight to the death to defend it. Rather boring.
History -> rye bread. Dense, serious, a grown up choice. Somehow makes sense as it appears to be a bread people ate in the dark ages.
Geography -> tiger bread. Think you are edgy and different, in reality a variation of white bread and generally regarded like English - something you do because you couldn‚Äôt make your mind up at A-Level. Slightly better job prospects as people may pick you for the novelty.
Philosophy -> pitta bread. Spend so long figuring out how to do it properly, ends up a pile of crumbs.
Languages -> panini. A staple, will always be studied, will always be eaten. Both the basis of the appeal of tiny caf√©s.
Liberal Arts -> pumpernickel bread. What is it? How do you find it? What does it mean? What is it made of?
Physics -> granary bread. Again, good for you but only strange people are into it.
Chemistry -> brown seeded bread. Slightly more interesting than standard brown bread. Risky. Might choke on a seed, might explode the lab.
Biology -> bagel. Good vibes. Generally beloved by everyone. Takes precise anatomical knowledge to slice in half properly, always in a pairing.
Law -> baguette. Takes a lot of effort to eat, but worth the pay off. High risk, high reward (goes off in about 0.2 seconds but also delicious). Too tough for the delicate.
Theology -> communion wafer. All about Christ. Goes well with wine, there always seems to be empty bottles on the floor in the department.
Classics -> cinnamon & raisin bagel. Some people love it, some people hate it. Posh, for people with acquired tastes.
Economics -> brioche. Exceedingly rich in flavour and financial status. Thinks it‚Äôs better than it is because it‚Äôs always a popular choice.
Not going to uni -> sourdough bread. The best option.","#Bristruth26559
Degrees as types of bread
English -> white bread. Very simple, plain, standard. Versatile. Generally regarded as alright by everyone, however thinks they are more loved than they universally are. People who love it LOVE it. Won‚Äôt have any other kind of bread, won‚Äôt do any other kind of degree. In direct conflict with....
Medicine/Engineering/Maths -> brown bread. A healthier choice (for consuming and for job prospects in this modern world). Not for everyone, but again, those who champion brown bread will fight to the death to defend it. Rather boring.
History -> rye bread. Dense, serious, a grown up choice. Somehow makes sense as it appears to be a bread people ate in the dark ages.
Geography -> tiger bread. Think you are edgy and different, in reality a variation of white bread and generally regarded like English - something you do because you couldn‚Äôt make your mind up at A-Level. Slightly better job prospects as people may pick you for the novelty.
Philosophy -> pitta bread. Spend so long figuring out how to do it properly, ends up a pile of crumbs.
Languages -> panini. A staple, will always be studied, will always be eaten. Both the basis of the appeal of tiny caf√©s.
Liberal Arts -> pumpernickel bread. What is it? How do you find it? What does it mean? What is it made of?

To continue the trend of #Bristruth26288 , as a final year English Lit student, these are the definitive personality types of this species that I have observed.
1) The Zombies - You see them in lecture theatres and seminars but have no idea who they are. Effectively fleshy weights used to fill rooms/lectures but seem void of any signs of sentience. They tend to look like the specific pool of people that are too good for love island, but not good enough for made in chelsea. They're in their third year but still maintain a STRONG stoke bishop energy.
2) The dodecahedrons- These guys are so edgy, they put the regular bristol cool kids to shame. Corduroy, tweed, berets, faux fur, baggy t-shirts, DMs, filas, flares- whatever the trend- it definitely started here. There's an aspirational bob dylan vibe within this group of people that, perhaps somewhat unachieved, is pretty charming, and at the very least, they've always got filters handy.
3) The smart ones: A small group of people that actually manage to finish all of the set reading and actually speak during seminars. Everyone hates them a little bit because they clearly wank to the sound of their own voice- but really we're all a little relieved when they walk though the door because it means we can all hide behind their massive egos. They can be terrible or great- most of them consider themselves modern day Simone de Beauvoirs and satres. They are perhaps something closer to Rupi Kaur.
4) The private school ones. Probably the most vapid, were it not for the Zombies. These ones can be loud and use long words like dodecahedron- they probably had a great English teacher in sixth form where they studied Ulysses, and thought they were living in a real life Dead Poet's Society. However, upon coming to university- realised that they didn't really care for english too much and have more often than not read absolutely nothing. They have an aura that suggests they kinda miss the Empire. It is sometimes hard to distinguish between this type of student and 'the smart one' as they are both good at bullshitting. A good way to determine which is which: 'the private school ones' can exclusively be found in Bargs every other night.
5) The other 30%: These guys are just pretty normal, sweet, smart people. The kind you'd be relieved to have in a group presentation. Diligently read the books and do well without boasting. You'll find yourself thinking: I wonder why we're not really good friends? Then you remember, they're mind-numbingly boring.
6) And last, but certainly not least: The poets: These tortured artists can often be found scribbling down lines of poetry, with knitted brows as they wonder which one would be best to send to Helicon. You might see them sitting across from you in life-drawing, or getting arrested at that XR protest. Yeah they're a little bit cliched- but they're pretty fit so you go along with their whims anyway. All this aside you could probably see them voting tory in 20 years time.","#Bristruth26322

Everyone hates them a little bit because they clearly wank to the sound of their own voice- but really we're all a little relieved when they walk though the door because it means we can all hide behind their massive egos. They can be terrible or great- most of them consider themselves modern day Simone de Beauvoirs and satres. They are perhaps something closer to Rupi Kaur.
4) The private school ones. Probably the most vapid, were it not for the Zombies. These ones can be loud and use long words like dodecahedron- they probably had a great English teacher in sixth form where they studied Ulysses, and thought they were living in a real life Dead Poet's Society. However, upon coming to university- realised that they didn't really care for english too much and have more often than not read absolutely nothing. They have an aura that suggests they kinda miss the Empire. It is sometimes hard to distinguish between this type of student and 'the smart one' as they are both good at bullshitting. A good way to determine which is which: 'the private school ones' can exclusively be found in Bargs every other night.
5) The other 30%: These guys are just pretty normal, sweet, smart people. The kind you'd be relieved to have in a group presentation. Diligently read the books and do well without boasting. You'll find yourself thinking: I wonder why we're not really good friends? Then you remember, they're mind-numbingly boring.
6) And last, but certainly not least: The poets: These tortured artists can often be found scribbling down lines of poetry, with knitted brows as they wonder which one would be best to send to Helicon. You might see them sitting across from you in life-drawing, or getting arrested at that XR protest. Yeah they're a little bit cliched- but they're pretty fit so you go along with their whims anyway. All this aside you could probably see them voting tory in 20 years time.",,1579224729,,,48,21,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2594227424131923&id=2052806998273971,

I know there are loads of exam stress and mental health posts out there right now, but I seriously cannot stress enough the importance of talking about what's going on in your mind with other people. It doesn't matter who you are, what you identify as or how old you are etc, we're all human with complex minds and while it is often tempting to run away from thoughts which seem like they shouldn't be there, it is always best to talk about them, rather than locking them away where they can fester and come back to haunt you even more. These may be thoughts that have been around for years or maybe have just surfaced but honestly, it is worth talking to friends, family, tutors, doctors or anyone. There is always something in what we so badly want to talk about that others can relate to and I know from experience that it is scary to let these thoughts out and feel the emotions that come with them. But in the long term it is better to experience uncomfortable emotions in talking out your thoughts for a short time compared to fencing them in and ignoring them and hoping they'll go away only to have them haunt you more frequently. Liberate your minds and make your life easier, we're all human. It's good to talk and it's OK not to be OK.","#Bristruth26302

To the amazing, strong, beautiful single women of the University of Bristol:
Tired of having no one to keep you warm and cosy at night??
Tired of having boring, unromantic dates??
Tired of having to deal with fuckboys all the time??
Searching for that perfect early Christmas present this year??
Then look no further than this bristruth here! I shall give you a once in a lifetime opportunity to play the notorious game - ‚Äò24 hours with a virgin‚Äô!!!
First, allow me to introduce myself! My full name is ****************** but I go under the alias ‚ÄòThe Gurning Virgin‚Äô (‚Äòcause apparently I gurn even when I‚Äôm just drinking). I‚Äôm a hard working guy, passionate about my degree. I have dark hair and brown eyes and - being as modest as possible - I would describe myself as average/good looking. I don‚Äôt like to big myself up too much, but take a look at the amazing compliments I have recently received from females:
‚ÄúWow you are so creepy!‚Äù - Gravity, 13/11/19
‚ÄúI seriously wish you luck in losing your virginity!‚Äù - Motion, 15/11/19
‚ÄúHonestly, in the nicest possible way, fuck off!‚Äù - Lizard Lounge, 22/11/19
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get laid can you!‚Äù - Pryzm, 27/11/19
Hopefully all of this will be enough to tempt you to sign up to playing the most coveted game of all: ‚Äò24 hours with a virgin‚Äô! Let me now describe to you how it will all work - simply give this post a ‚ù§Ô∏è react and I will message you to arrange a day which would work for both of us; the rules of the game are as follows:
1. We shall meet at 11am outside of Parsons! We will grab a coffee and have a friendly chat to get to know each other whilst walking to clifton triangle!
2. We will then arrive at Pinkmans where we will have a lovely brunch to fuel us for the day!
3. Next, we will head off down to Bristol Aquarium - perfect for you sea life lovers!
4. After that we will take a short walk over to the M-Shed museum - fantastic for us to discover Bristol‚Äôs history!
5. We will then pop over to St Nicholas‚Äô market to pick up a quick drink and some cake!
6. It will then be time to come back to mine, have a quick shower and change to get ready for evening!
7. We shall then head off to clifton village to have a romantic evening three course meal at the Ivy Brasserie - you can‚Äôt get more romantic than that!
8. Once we‚Äôve eaten, it‚Äôll then be time to get absolutely hammered at the Cori Tap - bet you can‚Äôt do the Cori Tap Challenge! üòâ
9. Now that we‚Äôll be absolutely shitfaced it will be time to go back to yours - we will take some time to chill out!
10. And now for the final, optional part of the game - complete this and you will have outright won ‚Äò24 hours with a virgin‚Äô! If you choose, we will have the most steamy, sensual and spicy sexual encounter you could ever have hoped for! Of course you can reject the offer - but why would you when you have the chance to rid ‚ÄòThe Gurning Virgin‚Äô of his virginity and receive the greatest accolade of them all - the winner of ‚Äò24 hours with a virgin‚Äô! We will have passionate, fiery and sweaty sex! We will make absolute magic happen in the bedroom!
Of course we will eventually fall asleep, wake up in the morning and then give each other the biggest hug possible to express our thankfulness for giving each other the greatest day of our lives! I will congratulate you on winning the game and, depending on how well we got on, I may then get on my knees and propose to you! I mean it wouldn‚Äôt get much better would it - ‚ÄúI met my husband through playing ‚Äò24 hours with a virgin‚Äô‚Äù!
So ladies - are you up for the challenge?? Do you back yourselves to win?? Do you dare to achieve eternal greatness?? This is your chance to go down in the history books! This is your chance to claim glory! Give this post a ‚ù§Ô∏è and you‚Äôll be within touching distance from being a true champion - the winner of ‚Äò24 hours with a virgin‚Äô!
See you soon!!! X

So on top of my demanding mathematics course, I have been using my spare time to work on an independent research project. I am now delighted to share it with you!
Title: Can Mathematical Modelling Really Help You Lose Your Virginity?
1. Abstract:
Losing your virginity can be an excruciatingly difficult challenge for many unattractive, or short, or stinky, or socially awkward guys. I empathise greatly. For this reason I have been motivated to find rigorous models which can aid one in attaining the holy grail of humanity - having sex.
It had recently come to my attention that losing your virginity can essentially be viewed mathematically as a dynamical system. One can use a system of ordinary differential equations to model the methods in which to convince a girl to have sex with you for the very first time.
An example of a such a model could, for argument‚Äôs sake, involve the following: take time, ‚Äút‚Äù, as an independent variable; we could then use equations involving variables ‚Äúc‚Äù and ‚Äúh‚Äù dependent on time, representing ‚Äúcompliments given to the girl‚Äù and ‚Äúhumourous remarks made in conversation‚Äù respectively, to give a suitable model.
One can then analyse the solutions to such appropriate model (note we are working with autonomous systems only in this project). We aim for a system which provides asymptotically stable solutions.
In layman‚Äôs terms this means the following - when one initially approaches a girl and starts a conversation with her, we are obviously starting a bit further away from the required solution (which is of course having a hot, steamy night of sexual passion in the bedroom). We want to find a system of differential equations such that if we start in a position a bit further away from our goal, as time goes on we move closer and closer and closer to our dream target!
Now of course we have to be consistent with the theory of ordinary differential equations - we can never officially touch the target solutions given an arbitrary starting point. If we were to do that then that would suggest we‚Äôd end up shagging the target girl for an infinite amount of time. Now unless you‚Äôre an absolute total tank and beast in bed, shagging for an infinite amount of time is impossible. But once we get so close in our model - we‚Äôve essential bagged that absolute stunner we‚Äôve been looking for!
On the other hand, Lyapunov stable solutions are undesirable: you know the times when you‚Äôre talking to girl and it‚Äôs going ok but that sexual spark just isn‚Äôt kicking off - that‚Äôs what this correlates to. And of course unstable solutions are not on the cards - no one wants flat out rejections as soon as you say hi!
2. Finding The Perfect Model
I can confirm that finally I have found a perfect system which satisfies the required conditions necessary to get any girl to have sex with you. In other words my virginity will be approaching its death very soon!!!
Now I cannot share this system equations and its variables with you - I would not like you to enjoy the sexual success and prowess that I am on the verge of embarking on. But what I can share with you is a couple of initial conversational tips (initial conditions) that would certainly work for my dynamical system and would get you laid without a doubt! But finding the correct dynamical system is up to you!
Initial condition 1) approach a girl and say ‚Äúhey sexy, you are absolutely different gravy my darling, let‚Äôs have a taste of each other!‚Äù Initial condition 2) approach a girl and say ‚Äúhey gorgeous, I want hardcore sex with you so bad babe, get in bed with me!‚Äù
Given that you can devise the right model, I‚Äôve found that these conversation starters are guaranteed to get you that good old shag and rid you of that dreaded virginity that has plagued your life for so many years!
3. Conclusion
Mathematics has come to the rescue once again: it will help me - and you - lose that virginity! I am so looking forward to implementing my new found methods from this week onwards - the results will be amazing!
[note: wow I‚Äôm such a virgin, if I don‚Äôt get slapped in the face after trying this I‚Äôll consider it a success ngl, but this is what the maths has told me to do. Need to have faith in maths you know, hopefully works. See you soon beautiful ladies X]","#Bristruth25113

A guide to some of the criticisms against Jeremy Corbyn
- ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a terrorist sympathiser!‚Äô- not just untrue but pretty much the opposite of true. He won the Gandhi award for promoting peace in Northern Ireland and elsewhere and was one of the MPs to sign a letter actively condemning the bombings in Birmingham. The entirety of criticism in this regard comes from pictures of him with the Sinn Fein politicians Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, both of whom have also been pictured with the Queen and Prince Charles because they‚Äôre politicians not terrorists.
- ‚ÄòHe doesn‚Äôt care about defence, he won‚Äôt use the nuclear option!‚Äô- also just straight untrue. He has committed to using nuclear weapons as a retaliatory method if necessary, but prefers systems of de escalation than a pre-emptive strike. I can not comprehend how preferring diplomacy to murdering millions of civilians is a controversial policy.
- ‚ÄòHe doesn‚Äôt tell us how he‚Äôs going to pay for anything, he just wants a magic money tree!‚Äô- the Labour manifesto from 2017 is costed and it is effectively the same as 2019‚Äôs (which is yet to be announced), so you can have a look at how Labour intends to pay for its policies if you can actually be bothered. Do you know who‚Äôs manifesto isn‚Äôt costed? The Conservatives.
- ‚ÄòLabour is anti-Semitic!‚Äô- this is the best of a bad bunch of criticisms. The home affairs select committee concluded that ‚Äòno reliable evidence to support the notion that antisemitism is any more prevalent in the Labour Party than in any other political party‚Äô. 0.08% of the members were found to have expressed anti Semitic sentiments and were expelled in 2018. Contrary to some opinion, Labour has also accepted without qualification the IHRA definition and put in place a more expedient method for removing members who are accused of anti semitism. I‚Äôm not saying that Jewish people who have expressed concern are lying or wrong, and I personally do think Labour need to take stronger and more public measures but I do think people in the media with vested interests in compromising Labour have distorted the facts to try and sway public opinion.
- According to an LSE study only 11% of newspaper articles accurately represent Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs views without qualification, the highest being the Guardian who manage to do it 27% of the time.
If you aren‚Äôt voting Labour for any of these reasons please reconsider and maybe ask yourself why the wealthy owners of so many news organisations feel threatened enough to lie about these things....
Austerity has killed 130,000 people since 2012, the Conservatives and Lib Dem‚Äôs voted for it. Do the right thing.

I've been left with no choice but to expose the Vegetarian and Vegan Society for their frankly cruel and malicious practices.
I was enjoying freshers fair like everyone else, frolocking in the mud alowing me to finally live my Shrek fantasy, until I came across the Vegan society's stall. I was offered a free biscuit. How thoughtful you might think. WRONG.
The biscuit in question was an Oreo. A suitable vegan treat one might believe. WRONG AGAIN. A simple google leads me to Oreo's website which clearly states that the biscuits are NOT suitable for vegans because they have milk as a cross contact.
So what did I do? I went right to the top and sent a message to the vice president of vegan society (who has frequently visited Taka Taka and Donervans on a night out and also ate my breadsticks which may contain milk as well btw) But what was her response?
She basically told me that she doesn't care and that sometimes we have to say lies to make it to the top. #EXPOSED.

Thank you to our 14 admins who have been amazing this year, dealing with up to 300 submissions per day. We appreciate all they do so much. Being a Bristruths admin may not be a substitute for a personality but it definitely is a substitute for a part-time job.
But as always, the biggest thank you goes to all of you. This year you've sent us over 50,000 submissions on Bristruths alone ‚Äì thank God only 400 of them were about milk. We hope you've enjoyed the weird discussions about BDE, blackboard going down, and the infamous Noise Pages.
We look forward to seeing you in September to do it all again. Perhaps next year we will finally discover what BDE really is.
Have a great summer!

Here is my personal ranking of the three versions of 'No Ordinary Girl' from H2O: Just Add Water:
3) Indiana Evans (Season 3)
Now I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this one considering Indiana Evans plays Bella Hartley on the show and everyone seems to like her for some reason. I'll admit, the song is definitely the best produced and mastered version but overall I just find it extremely basic and 'neutral' sounding. Positives include the big lead into the chorus and the nice use of ad-libs whilst the negatives include a lack of 'power' in Indiana's voice and the worst bridge of the three (its way too short). 5/10
2) Ellie Henderson (Season 1)
A lot of people may feel as though this one is the best because it was the original, I'm not going to base my opinion on this fact alone. Ellie has the best voice of the three and the song carries a quick tempo, allowing it to sound much more exciting than Indiana's. Also I really like the 'gi-i-i-i-r-l-l-l' part (if you know you know). However, the song suffers from a really long guitar rift which doesn't really fit and there is a very limited use of instruments and production. 7/10
1) Kate Alexa (Season 2)
This is it. This is the only version of these songs I can get up and dance to. It has the best bridge, the biggest lead into the chorus and has a really edgy rock vibe. Whilst Kate does appear to have the worst voice of the three, it isn't really needed to carry the rest of the song. 9/10 (imagine if Ellie sung on this version wooow)","#Bristruth23582

[Overseas Student from Hong Kong]
As many of you might be aware of, there was a huge protest in Hong Kong. More than 1 million people went out and protested against the Extradition Law Amendment Bill (ELAB), about 1/7th of the population in Hong Kong.
The reason why many people were against it was because, with the Bill passes, the Chinese government could extradite any fugitives that committed felony in China. When Hong Kong was under the British Regime the established Common Law system was intended to have a barrier between the us and the Chinese legal system as China has been known for not having ‚Äúfair‚Äù legal system. Many people in China were arrested based on their political point of view, and yet were charged with another irrelevant crime (eg. Ai Weiwei - tax evasion)
Officials in Hong Kong are now pushing the ELAB to pass this Wednesday. With that enacted, Chinese government would be able to lawfully prosecute anyone who speak against the authority. All they need is just creativity and think of a crime to ‚Äúlegally‚Äù extradite that person. It deeply erodes the freedom of speech and protest in my opinion. People can no longer speak up for anything they feel unjust about the society. Nor will they be able to have a government that represents the people.
What I am furious the most is that those officials are all overseas passport holders, or permanent residence (especially England). It means that after treading the basic rights of people in Hong Kong, and when they retired, they could enjoy a luxurious retirement life in England or elsewhere in the world, without bearing any consequences.
I am not intended to bring up any debates in this post. All I would like to do is to share my point of view as a HongKonger, and remind the fellow members in Bristruth that Democracy is only precious when it is lost or eroded by power and authority. I was reading 1984 when I did GCSE. I considered that as a political fiction describing a dystopia state and I swear to God I have never thought of that to becoming real. Now when I read the fiction again, and looking at Hong Kong, I can‚Äôt really tell the difference between them.
Thank you for your time reading this and may God bless the Queen and Hong Kong.","#Bristruth23502

Whilst mine was always friendly in person, she never replied to my emails and when I confronted her about it she told me that she ""only responds to emails if I send them to her more than three times"". Plus, she forgot to send my reference letter to two of the Unis I applied to and I only realised this too late, even though I explicitly told not to forget.
Thanks for wasting my application fee and the bad advice I received over the years xx","#Bristruth23329

I'm thinking about buying some bamboo make-up wipes, as I've realised I use a lot of them in every month. I was wondering if washing them in the washing machine doesn't mean that all the microplastics inside the makeup will end up straight in the oceans, instead of being ""trapped"" in normal cotton wipes that are then just thrown away. I've tried to find some papers about it to understand what's worse (single use waste or microplastics in the oceans) but I couldn't find anything.. Can someone please let me know?

I get it's a joke, but people take it as an actual, educational joke like it's a man yelling at the sea, and that's just wrong. Furthermore, these things have an actual impact on discussions about conservation efforts ‚Äî If every time Koalas get brought up, someone posts this shit, that means it's seriously shaping public opinion about the animal and their supposed lack of importance.
""Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves, the only thing they eat, have almost no nutritional value.""
Non-ecologists always talk this way, and the problem is you‚Äôre looking at this backwards.
An entire continent is covered with Eucalyptus trees. They suck the moisture out of the entire surrounding area and use allelopathy to ensure that most of what‚Äôs beneath them is just bare red dust. No animal is making use of them‚Äîthey have virtually no herbivore predator. A niche is empty. Then inevitably, natural selection fills that niche by creating an animal which can eat Eucalyptus leaves. Of course, it takes great sacrifice for it to be able to do so‚Äîit certainly can‚Äôt expend much energy on costly things. Isn‚Äôt it a good thing that a niche is being filled?
""They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal""
It's pretty typical of herbivores, and is higher than many, many species. According to Ashwell (2008), their encephalisation quotient is 0.5288 +/- 0.051. Higher than comparable marsupials like the wombat (~0.52), some possums (~0.468), cuscus (~0.462) and even some wallabies are <0.5. According to wiki, rabbits are also around 0.4, and they're placental mammals.
""Additionally their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons.""
Again, this is not unique to koalas. Brain folds (gyri) are not present in rodents, which we consider to be incredibly intelligent for their size.
""if you present a koala with leaves plucked from a fucking branch laid on a flat fucking surface the koala will not recognise it as food.""
If you present a human with a random piece of meat, they will not recognise it as food (hopefully). Fresh leaves might be important for koala digestion, especially since their gut flora is clearly important for the digestion of Eucalyptus. It might make sense not to screw with that gut flora by eating decaying leaves.
""Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.""
That's an extremely weird reason to dislike an animal. But whilst we're talking about their digestion, let's discuss their poop. It's delightful. It smells like a Eucalyptus drop!","#Bristruth22914

You go in and do your wee before forming a cute little circle with everyone you know, and the one person who one of your Flatmates brought but didn‚Äôt introduce hovers awkwardly on the outside. You observe the dancing etiquette and imitate for a couple hours, take a smoke break every so often to wipe the sweat off your face and repeat until it‚Äôs 3-4 in the morning and you call it a night.

To the guy I got with in Lola's on Tuesday night,
here is how you perpetuate rape culture :
1. you informed me that if you bought me a drink I would ""owe"" you a kiss.... (I bought my own drink)
2. you legitimately used the phrase ""you're mine now"" as well as ""you're so sexy, I might not be able to help myself""
3. despite me clearly looking uncomfortable and pulling away, you continued to kiss my neck and try to get me to touch you
4. after telling you numerous times that I did not want to go home with you, you followed my friend and I to the chip shop expecting me to change my mind
5. you informed me that you would not leave the chip shop until I gave you my snapchat because I was ""too sexy"" ....(my friend and I decided to be the ones to leave the chip shop instead)
Despite telling you after incident #1 why your behaviour was problematic, you continued to behave in the exact same way.
That I even had cause in the first place to have to explain to you why this behaviour makes a person uncomfortable is quite frankly ridiculous. That I am having to explain for a second time because you clearly didn't get the message is inconvenient, frustrating and should be unnecessary, but evidently isn't.
Consent is not difficult to understand, but let's break it down for your small mind so that hopefully the next woman doesn't have to:
- the basics first (as you don't even seem to have a grasp of these):
* saying nothing is not consent - a yes is required
for consent
* a person can consent and then change their mind
- Consenting once, to one kiss, is not consent to future kisses or other physical and sexual acts (see #3), nor does it permit you to continually ask for sex after the person refused the first time (see #4). Trying to change someone's mind after they have said no means that the required culture of consent is non-existent.
- Buying a person something such as a drink (or giving a favour/providing a service) does not mean that that person owes you a sexual act in return (see #1) - you cannot exchange a drink for control over another person's body.
- Being attracted to someone, again, does not give you the right to their body or the right to contact them (see #2 & #5). I am not yours, I am not an object for you to possess. Saying that you can't ""help yourself"" because you are attracted to me is not a compliment, it is a nod to rape.
Surely this is just fucking logic.
Sincerely, a student who is tired of having to constantly repeat herself.","#Bristruth19469

I am developing an unhealthy relationship with briscrushes. I started sending in a crush about someone I actually really like, but currently won't make any move on in real life for several reasons. Then seeing him react was such a thrill in my rather boring life that I continued. By now 4 crushes have been posted, a 5th is on the way, and even though they are anonymous I feel like I have made a complete fool of myself. I am scared of seeing this person again in real life and of doing anything that will give me away. And with all this in my head, I wouldn't be able to date him even if I had the chance.
I am sorry if I hurt anyones feelings or put people in a spot where they don't feel comfortable. You that I wrote the crushes to, I am sorry for exposing you and for stealing your time. I know what I did was not okay, and I apologise. Even though these briscrushes stem from my deep insecurities and confidence issues, that is no excuse to act the way I did. I will do my best efforts to stop posting and focus my attention on dealing with my own problems.

- Taka Taka is your friend. Do NOT make an enemy out of it; it'll starve your all-nighters sessions
- If you don't like partying, hang around the Arts & Social Science Library (or ASS, for short)
- There's a microwave oven and hot water at Hawthorns
- The ASS is not as overwhelming as its name (or some Bristruths) may suggest
- The Lizard Lounge is not Mark Zuckerbot's lair
- Mayonnaise is not an instrument
- Source Cafe consumables will drain your wallet & bank account faster than that Nigerian Prince
- If you're here in Bristol for the girls/guys, be prepared to feel sorely disappointed
- MVB is not just for CS students, so don't feel too entitled to the space
- Nerd/dork/geek culture is highly appreciated
- Unless you want to get banned from humanity, use a condom FFS (literally)
- Don't trust anyone; don't even trust the guy/gal in the mirror

1. It doesn‚Äôt actually matter. Whatever you get on that grade, whether you get a first on a second, it doesn‚Äôt matter- good things will still come to you. So don‚Äôt beat yourself up.
2. Enjoy your time here. Go out and socialise, do something new- you‚Äôre only young once. There‚Äôs never gonna be another time in your life when you don‚Äôt have more responsibilities, so enjoy being free.
3. But don‚Äôt waste it. Learn to balaaance! Keep challenging yourself. Learn new things. Keep your brain going. Go to your lectures, read some books, you got this shit.
I am now done. Most of the people on my course I will never see again and that sucks. Bristol is a great city, filled with amazing people and it‚Äôs a great place to begin changing into a better version of yourself. Go and create some great memories with wonderful friends and enjoy being a student and enjoy all that free time, because it‚Äôs gonna go in a blink of an eye.

Nonetheless, I still recognise my privilege, I was lucky enough to have a loving mum who wouldn't let me mix with the wrong crowds, I was lucky enough to have aunties who helped me with maths when I was struggling, I was lucky enough to be locked into a good group of friends who push each other to be better. I am grateful for all the opportunities I had and have and I know there are people out there who don't have attentive parents or a good support system, or any of the myriads of things that helped me get into the position I am. I wish those people the best and I try my best not to judge them when they're in difficult places or appear to be making bad choices.
That's what recognising your privilege is about to me, it is not about guilt/debt because you're better, it's about judgement. It is very difficult to place yourself in the shoes of another and it's imperative that we value others in society as much as we value ourselves.

Golden Virginia - The same as Amber Leaf but you enjoy moist af, cigar-ry baccy for an incomprehensible reason. It does burn longer tbf, maybe you're getting your money's worth.
Golden Virginia Smooth - As above but you get a front pouch.
American Spirit - ¬£14 for rollies that burn up in two tokes because it's so dry? You either only smoke to look cool and have too much money, or you lack any rationality.
Cutter's Choice - A seasoned smoker, not to pungent, not too fruity. Perfect for chaining 27 outside the ASS everyday.
Gold Leaf - You hate giving away tobacco and you're stingy so you've trained yourself to like the fruitiest, most disgusting baccy going so no one will want to scrounge from you. You also get kicks out of blowing it near people's face because they recoil.

Slytherin did nothing wrong. N O T H I N G. Some ancient hat sat you with some other kids because you‚Äôre a bit ambitious and that makes you evil from the time you‚Äôre eleven years old. You haven‚Äôt even got your first pubic hair when the rest of your life is decided for you for the sheer crime of being ambitious. Maybe so many evil wizards came from Slytherin because they‚Äôre treated as evil from such a young age? Your robes are green therefore you‚Äôre evil and you can‚Äôt make friends with the rest of the school. Lucky you. I honestly cannot blame Slytherins for growing up with a huge resentment for anyone not in Slytherin, because it‚Äôs not like a welcoming atmosphere is there is it? Then in the final film when they all get locked in the dungeons when everyone else gets to fight because one girl thought all of their lives might be more important than a single other guy‚Äôs life. Hmmm. Fuck Gryffindor, fuck Ravenclaw, and fuck Hufflepuff, they made evil wizards, Slytherin had nothing to do with it.

Types of French guys at Bristol:
Parisian ‚Äú√âcole Priv√©e‚Äù Antoine:
From the richest part of Paris. Came to England for his year abroad. Thinks that popularity is very important, and will always be careful about his image. Is the kind of person to unfollow people on Instagram so that his following/followers ratio looks impressive. Goes clubbing often, and nobody knows what he studies (probably not even him). Probably doesn‚Äôt speak much English, but still thinks he‚Äôs bilingual. Doesn‚Äôt have any British friends, as he has managed to recreate a ‚Äú16√®me arrondissement‚Äù microclimate in his residence hall. Smokes, but only in front of other people. Complains about the cigarette prices in the UK, despite it being his parents‚Äô money (and is getting very worried about the rising prices back home).
‚ÄúWeeaboo Supr√™me‚Äù Gaspard:
A vitriolic shut-in. Is clear proof of the strong influence of Japanese culture in France. Despises any form of human interaction, and for that reason will lock himself in his room and watch anime. Likely is an avid collector of anime stash, because ‚Äúanime girls can understand him better than actual people‚Äù. Definitely watches hentai. Left France to avoid his parents‚Äô judging stares. Despite that, a good student despite never going to lectures, and studies maths or engineering. People are usually reminded of his existence twice a year, during exams.
Literature and beaux-arts Maximilien:
The very definition of condescendant. Studies art. Has mastered all aspects of French literature, and will not let an opportunity to criticise English literature to waste. Probably has a shrine to Balzac in his room, and his understanding of the world is based on works such as L‚ÄòAssommoir, le P√®re Goriot, or Le Rouge et le Noir. Has mastered the piano, and refuses to play anything that‚Äôs not French, and from the classical period. Is a devout catholic. Came to the UK for a year abroad, and wants to go back home as soon as possible.
‚ÄùNobilit√©‚Äù Jean-Fran√ßois:
Born into a family of nobility, probably has the particule ‚Äúde‚Äù in front of his family name. Is at uni for the ‚Äúsocial experience‚Äù. Is as condescendant as Maxime. Is horrified by English food. Only drinks French wine bottled before 1980. Hobbies include hunting, and going to operas. Likes the idea of Theatrum Mundi. Has a decent enough level of English to be able to order food at taka taka. He secretly wishes for the return of absolute monarchy in France. Cries when anyone mentions the German Occupation, though bringing him Pierre Herm√© macarons will quickly cheer him up.
‚ÄúHeureusement que j‚Äôai pas fait pr√©pa‚Äù Michel
The most common type of frenchy you could find. Has an interest in a popular subject, such as law, medicine or engineering, but doesn‚Äôt want to study in France because of the very strong competitive spirit. Actually appreciates the UK and their university system, and loves laughing at his friends back in France that now probably have depression because of their studies. Is not from Paris, and hates having his hometown called ‚Äúprovince‚Äù by a Parisian. Is slightly fed up of the baguette and croissant jokes.","#Bristruth3303
