The university are supposedly telling departments that they're all going to have to make some fairly hefty savings next year and these aren't the kinds of savings that they can make by scrimping on materials in practicals and shit. Long story short a lot of lecturers may be facing increased work loads or potentially even redundancies, so if you're emailing any of them about your exam feedback being late or whatever the hell it is undergrads are getting upset about these days, keep in mind that they've probably got enough on their plate.
If anyone deserves your ire it's the big dogs at the top bcos they're the ones making all these decisions and you can bet your last meal deal that their 200k a year asses wont be taking a pay cut.","#Sheffession9903

It got more and more painful so I got googling and we were hoping she didn't have 'carpal tunnel syndrome'.
Then we remembered that she bought a sharpie colouring book a few weeks ago and I reckon she's averaged 7 hours a day colouring.

My girlfriend and I used to fart in front of each other with no shame however the problem soon got out of hand and we were farting all the time. So we have now introduced a fart pot where each fart costs ¬£1 and we spent whatever is in it on dates. This has to a degree solved the problem but I must say it would of been best to never fart from the start as it‚Äôs costing a fortune, so therefore I would say it‚Äôs best to try and not fart in front of your S/O and when you do blame it on the dog.","#Sheffession9837

Living in the lake district has given me better opportunity than most to get out and about these last few months. The scenic beauty has made my hour of daily exercise far more enjoyable than it would have been for many others trapped in towns and cities. I totally understand why people have been keen to visit beauty spots now that lockdown restrictions are being eased, and I don't begrudge outsiders from visiting to enjoy the scenery. But for anyone that leaves litter out in the countryside (or anywhere else, for that matter), know this: I despise you. You are worse than an animal, and I yearn to see you fail. If you really, really, really feel the need to buy a bag of fucking hula-hoops to carry you through a scenic walk in the country, at least have the decency to carry the empty packet once you've finished. If you don't do this, it proves that you are a bad person and deserve to live in a totalitarian state. Some will argue that this is too harsh; I would argue that they are a blight on the earth.","#Sheffession9834

As a minority, I feel this is an important point to stress. Racist shaming is not the way to go. By forcing people to share your exact views only pushes racist thoughts deeper inside a person. It's important to be able to discuss things without being labelled a racist. Of course we need to address obvious racist actions but we can't change a person's intrinsic views by shaming them when they don't parrot our exact narrative. There are many factors in society that lead to inequality, with racism being one of them. Until we can have an open discussion about it, nothing will change. So please, if someone commits an unforgivable 'microaggression' don't label them a racist and be done with them. Instead, be a friend and talk about it.

So everyone loves Harold, the Endcliffe student village cat. He was actually my cat from a kitten up until around 2018 when my living circumstances changed and I had to rehome him. He now lives with a lovely couple near to the student village. His name is actually Bolt (you might see he has a bolt like marking on his back). I thought everyone might be missing their favourite university cat, so I have some never before seen pictures of him. Hopefully these pictures lift everyone's spirits in these dark times üòª","#Sheffession9769

Feel that this is safe to say now that lockdown has happened. At the beginning of the year my friends and I found out that Revolutions on West Street had an app where there were codes to getting free drinks. After a day a friend had discovered multiple codes from different cities that all worked on a single account and that we could easily make multiple emails to make more accounts. Flash forward through freshers week and the week after and around 6 of us had consumed over 200 free cocktails thanks to going up to seperate bartenders with different codes. Didnt pay for a single drink for pres the entire time as I would down multiple cocktails before going out.
Ps: Fridays were the best, 6 free cocktails an account and all old accounts gave an extra free one. Never got caught somehow","#Sheffession9768

4)the village store prices but too lazy to shop anywhere else
5) trying to sleep in howden and drunk girls running past at 2am on their way to derwent

I'm genuinely curious right now, with all these protests and riots going on what do people actually want to change? Yes I know we don't want racism that's fairly obvious but that's really vague. What is the actual physical changes people want? Because every single protestor I've seen has just been yelling end racism or something similar.
Also the actual protestors who are genuinely peaceful deserve hella credit. The people who are assaulting the police just for being police (weirdly I've seen plenty of videos where people are assaulting black police ironically) aren't too much different than the police who abuse their power. You're assaulting someone so if you were to get smacked then that's not brutality that's just fighting back.","#Sheffession9766

To #Sheffessions9740 although I think your post was well intentioned, I think you have missed the point..
Silence is Violence.
Silence is allowing racism, and frankly all forms of discrimination, to go unchallenged.
The actions you are taking; signing petitions, educating yourself, donating and starting discussions with friends/family are helpful, a good start and meaning that you are NOT being silent.
Reposting things may just come across as virtue signalling, but it actually has positives. Sharing educational resources and showing the overwhelming support behind being anti-racist will help make those fake people actually take some action.
As a POC, the people who need help to unlearn their racist, discriminatory tendencies funnily enough won‚Äôt listen to the likes of me.
Sorry if it‚Äôs an inconvenience for you to see these posts, it‚Äôs a privilege to learn about racism.

We hide behind the term 'International students' and make a lot of stereotypes and make racist jokes. We all need to stop and consider how what we say is only a joke to us and can actually be extremely hurtful to the people we stereotype.

It would have worked, had they not started a fight with them, culminating in a lot of screaming and bawling. The police were called, my landlord was called, and because the two blokes had been
getting progressively creepier during lockdown, (I won't even repeat the comments I was getting off them) my landlord relocated me to an empty property in the middle of exams (easier for me to move than to start proceedings to legally evict the guys).

The black lives matter movement is so important and standing up to prejudice needs to be something we all do but lets get some things straight.
""Silence is violence"" is not true. Signing petitions, educating yourself, donating and talking to family and friends about this is just as important. Just because you are speaking out on social media and reposting posts that have been shared 100 times before does not make you any better. This is not a fad and we do not need you virtue signalling!
""If you're not angry, you're not paying attention"". Its great that this has kicked off but this is nothing new, this is something we all know to happen all the time! Racism is not new and its appalling its taken this long for such a lot of you to finally do something. If youre only angry now, you were never paying attention before!
We are all fighting this together, stop finding ways to pit yourselves against each other! Support the POC in your life and lets change the world for the better.","#Sheffession9740

One of lockdowns biggest struggles is a lack of public toilets. I only discovered this when I went out for a few tinnies with a mate and found myself bursting for a wee on the walk home. It was a 20 minute walk and I knew I couldn't make it. Passing my old school on the main road, I saw my opportunity to go in some the bushes. Checking to see no one was looking, I wondered in. I then realised I was wearing a JUMPSUIT and had to fully strip down, but the situation was urgent so I did the business. I emerged from the bushes as if it were business as usual while people stared at me. At least I was a bit waved so all I felt was pure relief.","#Sheffession9717

üëç - Broomhill Friery. Bit of a detour for anyone who isn‚Äôt a fresher, but it‚Äôs worth it.

üòÜ - Balti King. We all know the hygiene isn‚Äôt great and you‚Äôll more than likely get the shits, but that doesn‚Äôt stop us from eating Tony‚Äôs delicacy.
ü•∞ (Care) - Home delivery. You just want to get home ASAP and love the thought of having a quick power nap whilst a Big Mac is enroute.
üò¢ - Pre bought. You realise you‚Äôd spend a lot in the club and want to save some money on takeaway food, but you‚Äôve still got to eat right? You buy frozen pizzas and chips for when you get back.
üò° - Oasis/Flavours. They‚Äôre the same, let‚Äôs not lie. Aslans equivalent but a bit closer to home. Still a detour for most though.","#Sheffession9716

I need some advice...I graduated last year and dont get me wrong I have a degree in a really good subject, but I picked that degree when I was 18. I'm near my mid-twenties now and none of the careers associated with my degree appeal to me anymore. I have found something im really interested in however after looking into apprenticeships and other routes into a career in that field it looks as though im going to have to do another degree. I dont know if I can even get funding for a second degree unless I went to somewhere like Open University. Has anyone else ever been in this predicament? Do I start over and do another degree? If I do I'll be almost 30 by the time I graduate again, however I am incredibly unhappy with where I'm at now. Please help üòî","#Sheffession9692

Hey guys, I don‚Äôt know if this will get posted but I‚Äôm looking for some advice. I am not really enjoying my course as I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs what I want to do with my life. There‚Äôs one job I think I could enjoy from it but it‚Äôs not really relevant to the course, so at the moment I‚Äôm basically doing 3 years of a course I don‚Äôt enjoy just to get a degree and a job that‚Äôs only somewhat relevant. Because of corona, I was thinking about completely dropping out of university and reapplying to Sheffield for the 2021/22 year on a new course that I‚Äôll enjoy more, but I don‚Äôt really want to be just finishing third year when I‚Äôm 24, when I could be in the aforementioned job by then if I just stuck it out on my current course. What should I do?","#Sheffession9628

Took a girl out to a nice restaurant and ended up paying the expensive bill for her to cut things off pretty much straight after. Found out she‚Äôd done this to a lot of lads
Simped hard to get her back on another date and told her she could order whatever she wanted with the inference I‚Äôd pay for it all again and in the end I split the bill. Her meal was ¬£¬£¬£ and mine was free because my uncle was the manager.

Decided to be a bit more rogue than my vanilla person was used to and sucked my boyfriend off in a foundry gender neutral cubicle. The thrill was amazing and I was starting to think I could get used to this racy miscreant lifestyle before we finally had to do the walk of shame out and the person at the front of the now really fucking long queue was a guy off my course. I dont know if this is a niche reference, but I said hi like Hugh Grant does in the hallway to Natalie in Love Actually and got the dirtiest look i've ever had in my life. My anxiety won't let me stop stressing about it even now and I didnt go to a single tutorial after that.

Prior to lockdown I was invited to the pub with a good friend and her housemate. At the pub her housemate (who had a bf) invited another guy and flirted with him all evening. They both got so hammered they could barely walk (it was 9pm). We walked back to endcliff together and he kept trying to give her a piggy back, finally he managed it and then fell smack on his face. Blood everywhere. It was pitch black, like 1 streetlight and he says he is missing a tooth. Here we are looking for a fucking tooth on the floor while he is bleeding everywhere! Miraculously my friend found the tooth (hero) so we go back to endcliff to clean him up- when we get to his flat we realise that the tooth, upon exiting his mouth had gone through that bit of skin under his lip and he had a massive hole. Housemate ends up calling 999 crying, abulance turns up AND THEY ONLY FUCKING KNOW HIS NAME AND RECOGNISE HIM FROM THE COUNTLESS TIMES HE HAS DONE STUFF LIKE THIS BEFORE. Still, at least the housemate didnt cheat on her bf, this time anyway....","#Sheffession9407

Me and my flatmate once went on a lil walk outside past all the flats and, as well as being impressed by the massive ass telescope in someone's kitchen on the ground floor, we couldn't help but notice the purple light. Then we saw the bird photos. As someone who genuinely took part in the RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch ~by themself~ lmao, has a bird poster up in their bedroom, and enjoys walking, I instantly felt connected to this person.

So having come back home down south due to a certain global pandemic, my mother thought it would be very apt for us to spread one of our late dogs ashes seeing as all the family was back home.
So having decided where we would spread the ashes we set off bringing our younger dog with us, for a bit of context, the two dogs had a love hate relationship that involved the eldest pissing on the youngest dog numerous times (Yes, I know it's very weird). As we got to the edge of the pond and proceeded to spread the ashes not only did the ashes set off my dads asthma causing him to have a fit, but also our youngest dog proceeded to piss all over his brothers ashes as some sort of weird 'getting his own back' send off to his late brother. It was a very emotional but rather quite fitting send off for such a good boy.
I hope those with dogs out there treasure every moment they get to spend with them.
I miss you big T x
P.S, please enjoy a photo of the two boys on one of the rare occasions that they got along","#Sheffession9068

Send your requests and shout outs to the ROAR/ TTC Facebook and instagram pages (and Roary too obviously üíõ). We can't wait to have the wildest Wednesday night when we open the Foundry doors once again but in the meantime we're excited we can at least keep the black and gold spirit up from the comfort of our own living rooms x

Is anyone else feeling completely demotivated as a result of these strikes/corona closures?
I can't seem to focus on anything at all or even begin to care about my academics right now. I'm really worried this is going to affect my grades this semester and it's reeeally getting me down. If anyone has any advice or motivational stories, I need them now more than ever. Thank you <3","#Sheffession8931

üêØRoar map loading....
A recent sheffession inspired me (and no I did not write it) to seriously crack on with creating a Roar map. So instead of focusing on my degree, I‚Äôve spent the last couple weeks finalising the map that a few have tried to make before.
Now I have finally completed said map, I am going to sell A2 printed posters for you to display in your room as a brilliant bit of Roar memorabilia!
Just purchase one below and I‚Äôll be shipping them out from 27th March!

Obviously in the final printed version, there won‚Äôt be any watermarks and the team names will be in focus. This is just to stop any copying/printing at home. Now no team names should be wrong as I have got primary research for each, however if they is any discrepancies then comment below and I can change it before the final is posted out!","#Sheffession8896

All students of Sheffield! The supreme command has already erased our names from the tenancy agreement. Our homes will be sacrificed for the budget of the uni. Therefore, you don't need to worry about your excessive drinking or noise complaints - because the night of Saturday the 22nd marks the day that we give our final salute to the Vale.

8) The Punchbowl
- I‚Äôve never seen anyone in there.
7) Noah‚Äôs Ark
- The local, it‚Äôs not for students and you‚Äôve got to respect that.
6) Old Grindstone
- Decent after the renovation, could be livelier but the pool tables are always available which is good.
5) The Closed Shop
- A good venue, very nice food. Beer garden is a bit small but it‚Äôs a lovely place for a nice pint.
4) The Springvale
- A good venue which is always lively, if a bit cramped when there‚Äôs a match on. Are the cheap pints worth the walk back up Springvale Road though?
3) Hally House
- Name another pub with as good a selection of board games. The range of pints available is great too. A well deserved 3rd place.
2) The Ball
- The gentrified Grindstone, good pints and good food. Lively, especially on quiz night.
1) Cobden View
- Sheffield‚Äôs hidden gem, a must visit for any student. Put having a pint here on your bucket lists. Tucked away and ambient, great quiz too.","#Sheffession8708

However once I‚Äôd chundered it splashed back up into my face, and I flinched, but proceeded to chunder all over myself and the bathroom and was left sitting there wondering how I ever became such a mess. All of this means whenever I even smell uncle bens Mexican rice I have flashbacks and can‚Äôt stand the thought of it.",,1579122067,,,32,6,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2458650237731166&id=2026217620974432,

UoS and Hallam rivalry has been heating up recently, yet no one is moving past the same old insults.
I propose an all out ROAST BATTLE, which should be scored much like tennis...
Rules:
-Tag each as #Roast for clarity.
-Each roast must contain which uni it originated from or which uni it‚Äôs being served/returned to.
-Pretty obvious but the better roasts are the ones with most reacts.
-Number of reacts on a roast to be confirmed 48 hours after initially posted.
-Voters mustn‚Äôt be biased, vote purely on the funniest digs.
-A uni wins a point by having the best 3 successive roasts (like a rally), judged by which unis 3 roasts score/add up higher.
-Roasts don‚Äôt have to be true, (I know some of you are a bit tetchy)
I wanna see some quality content, good old ‚Äúyour momma jokes‚Äù etc.
-Only a single match is played. That‚Äôs a minimum of 24 roasts in total.
-As in tennis, winner must win with 2 points ahead, so this could take a while.

I work at a popular casual dining chicken restaurant and we run our chicken levels low at night in order to reduce waste, so if someone comes in at say, 9:30, the chances are we‚Äôll have to cook a fresh chicken off to serve - something that takes around half an hour. So if someone comes in around 9:30ish, by the time the chicken comes out the oven we‚Äôll be closed. Needless to say this slows down our close and is a very frustrating thing to do. On one occasion, I dropped a freshly cooked off chicken on the floor... which I promptly picked up and served to the type of self-righteous prick who thinks it‚Äôs okay to come into a restaurant so close to its closing time.

IC Sweats are experienced during the first 5 minutes of being in the IC as you are frantically scanning every inch of the building looking for a spare seat. The sweats are brought on by a mixture of things: the outrageously high temperature in there, the nervousness of not finding a seat and having to bolt it up and down those flights of stairs.
The IC Sweats subside once you have found your seat, you take off some layers and give yourself a bit of time to recover from the mini workout that was securing your study space.","#Sheffession4288 We‚Äôre all familiar with Sheff Sweats, but let me propose a new term - IC Sweats.

2269731349956390,"#Sheffession4286 Okay so I have to start this off by saying I've handed in my last assignment and now finished uni... But before you hate me, listen to this piece of advice.
A few weeks ago I was in the middle of dissertation writing and still had an assignment left to write, I was hating myself, hating uni and basically hating life. But all I needed to get through it was 2 mantra's.
1. A count down til it was all over eg. Only 3 weeks till it's done (can also be done in days as well)
2. The knowledge that all the work no matter how horrible wouldn't kill me. I wasn't going to drop dead from writing an assignment and I knew even if I failed that it didn't mean my actual life was over. I'd still be alive.
So I guess my advice is the pain and anxiety of exams and assessment is temporary and it doesn't end the most important thing you have, your life. So no matter how many sleepless nights, how much you want to quit, please keep that in your mind.
Yours truly, a 3rd year whose now finished and has to actually start proper adult life now xox
