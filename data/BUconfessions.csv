Honestly as a senior I feel like a dead man walking. Sometimes it's difficult to appreciate the best years of college before its too late, and now my life is all about job applications, and racing a timer to graduation when I will be completely assumed an adult, and assumed ready for life outside of this wonderful place. It's really hard, but if you can somehow learn to appreciate all of student life and the best times of college before senior year, do it. College is SO HARD, the hardest part of life for most of us so far, but it's also by far one of the best things life has to offer as an experience. Enjoy it before you are in the final stretch like me.","#5206

I don't know how grade deflation works, I don't even know how people can tell that their GPA has been deflated. Like, what are the signs?? Is it like a bad grade as a higher weight and impacts your grade more? Is it because some professors curve the grade? I just accept my mediocre GPA and think that's what its value actually is, but how would I be able to accurately compare it to the way other school's scale their gpas?? I'm a senior and I still am confused by the whole thing, sorry for the stupid questions.","#5205

I’ve read posts about people having crushes on their best friends and I just wanted to share some of my input. I had a crush on my best friend for half a year. Years later we are still best friends and even today every once in a while I’m like maybe I like them again maybe i don’t I don’t know. But what’s important is that they are in my life. I would never do anything to jeopardize the friendship I have as it means the world to me. They will always have a special place in my heart and in the end we are still soulmates (best friend soulmates) and they are still one of the greatest things to ever happen to me. All I want is for them to be happy whether it be with me or someone else. I don’t care, their happiness is all I care about. I hope this helps with anyone who has ever liked their best friend or is friends with someone they have a crush on...sometimes you are meant to be in each other’s lives for a certain reason whether best friends or relationship but if it’s meant to be then it will be. Just focus on yourself and being a positive happy human being and the right person will come along (perhaps that person is your friend). Just focus on your friendship and although sometimes it can be hard just take it from me, once you get over those emotions you will see what an amazing friendship y’all can have","5203

It’s creepy when I hear how some professors fuck their students or even date them. Actually, it’s just skeevy when I hear about men twice as old as these girls fucking and dating them. And y’all like that shit?? Y’all are okay with that? I mean that’s pretty predatory on the guy’s end. We have this one professor where there’s a rumor that he has to keep his door open bc he would apparently come on to the students. And it’s just irritating to hear how everyone says he’s sexy (nigga ain’t shit, he a typical average middle aged white dude) and there’s this culture where it’s normal to get it on with someone that old in higher position of authority. Why is this normal now?? It grosses me out to hear people say “oh I’m dating this professor at x school”, especially when the dude is MARRIED. That’s not a cool thing, y’all need to get away ASAP bc that’s some nasty shit. A married dude or some guy much older than you making advances. That will haunt you later and it will hurt you. Please stay safe and please stop acting like this is okay.","#5200

Not really a confession but just want to say something. A lot of posts here are kinda sad and gloomy, which I understand. Suicide is a big topic too. I can't share too much from personal experience, but I do want to mention something. The law of conservation of mass, in simple terms, states that matter essentially changes form. Nothing lost, nothing gained. I believe the law also applies to emotions. Every single bad decision or negative feeling is not the opposite of a good decision or positive feeling. It gets better. In terms of emotions, you will naturally become accustomed to the situation. While these negative feelings may not subside quickly, they will eventually. If you are unable to experience them now, it also means that someone else is as happy as you are sad. Nothing lost, nothing gained. Satisfaction with anything naturally depreciates and becomes the typical situation. In the end, everything will even out. To the point of being unsure, life is short. Existentialist theory, in simple terms, is optimistic nihilism. If there's someone you like, a party you want to go to, or anything that you are unsure about, go for it. Even if you fail, your confidence will rise. The first step is always the hardest. But every one that follows will be easier until you reach your ideal situation. If you reach that point, you can pay it forward to someone else. In the end, life is short. You might as well enjoy everything while you can. Take a risk. Make a change. If you take nothing from this, it's fine. I have no regrets sharing it. The only thing holding you back is you. Cheers everyone 😉","#5184

There's this girl that I've known and liked since freshman year (I'm a junior now) who I've always admired and found to be utterly beautiful and amazing. To be honest, although we know each other, we don't often talk to each other because we're not that close (which I wish wasn't the case). She's absolutely beautiful, crazy smart, and has an infectious personality. Sometime in the beginning of this semester, I found out that the guy she had been going out with since freshman year were no longer together, and it made me happy. He had been a dick to her on numerous occasions and it made me mad whenver I saw her so sad and constantly tryng to make such a one-sided relationship work. Recently, I found out that she had gotten into another relationship with some other guy but I could see and hear how happy she seemed. I'm actually genuinely happy for her. Someone as kind and smart as she is, deserves someone who appreciates her and can treat her right. So even though I've liked her for such a long time, I've come to realize that the thing that would make me even happier than being with her, is just to be able to see her smile without the pain and sadness hidden behind it.","#5183

I don't know what to do anymore. The love of my life died from an overdose a little over a month ago. He always had the cutest smile whenever he looked at me. When we met, he was a straight edge and I was the one always getting high and he always made sure I was being safe and would help me get back home if I was too high or something. During the summer, I would wake up in the morning tucked in his bed sometimes with little recollection of what I did the night before and he would either be asleep in his chair across the room or making breakfast. He was bad at cooking, but I loved the effort he put into it despite all of that. His parents absolutely HATED seeing me around the house, but he didn't care. He told them that if they wanted me to leave, then he's leaving with me and since then they never said anything. He understood me and my hardships, they didn't. A month into our relationship, he started to experiment too and I was always worried about his drug use, always expressed my concern, and thought that was enough. His parents didn't know about his drug use whatsoever. At the end of the summer on the day he passed, he told me that he was super sad to see me fly back to BU. He was there for me when I needed him, but when he needed me the most, I failed him. Since then, my grades have been plummeting, my work drive is at rock bottom, I sometimes skip a bunch of lectures because I can't push myself to get out of bed, and I've lost a bunch of what little weight I have cause I barely ever have an appetite. His parents blame me for his death. I just want to lie in bed all day and cry. I get urges to just get drunk or super high all the time to forget about it all, but he would hate me if I did that, so for the past month I've been completely clean, refusing to even have a drop of alcohol or anything else. I miss him so much and would give up everything to have him back.","#5139

I think I'm truly in love. I've known this girl since highschool and I was so happy and surprised to hear that she was going to BU as well because she's straight up Ivy league material. We're pretty good friends, but I wish it was so much more than that. It's been a super long time since I've looked at a girl and thought, her personality is unmatched by any other girl. She has so much confidence and energy, it just radiates from her. She's been through some shit, but always keeps on a smile and an aura of positivity. She knows how to balance her social life with her studies and career and that's truly remarkable. If we somehow in the future got together and it worked out, I would tell my kids that their mother is Wonder Woman and they best believe it. But for now, I'm too scared to make a move because I'm afraid of being rejected, making things awkward, and losing her. I hope dreams do come true, but if it doesn't I hope she's happy with whoever she's with. She is truly Ms. Independent and that's why I love her.","#5138

My parents immigrated to this country with little to no money and they wanted my life to be easier than theirs. After highschool, I decided to be completely independent, paying for my own tuition, food, room & board, etc. because my parents work long grueling jobs and make about a combined 40 grand. I'm a Questrom student and I manage to make about 150 grand every year to pay off everything and to buy my friends and family things every now and then (my apologies if this is sounds like a brag). It feels great when you earn everything you have instead of having your parents spoil you with luxiourious cars and weekend shopping money. It bothers me so much when rich spoiled kids complain that their parents don't give them enough. I don't even own a car or any expensive clothes, I usually just wear a simple t-shirt. All the money I make I usually invest, or buy my closest friends dinner or a gift of some sort(most of my friends don't know how much I make until I've known them for a good amount of time, it's how I weed out fake friends from true friends), or put it towards my parents' retirement (I'm their little investment and it sure paid off :) ). I love and am thankful for everything my parents have done for me and for all my closest friends for being there for me when I need them the most. They all wanted the best for me and helped make me the man I am today. When my parents first saw me in an expensive suit that I bought for a class presentation, they both started crying tears of joy cause, ""our little boy is all grown up"". Every couple of weeks, when I have to fly out to LA or NYC for the weekend for some business meetings and I tell my parents I'll be out of Boston for a few days, my parents always call me every night to make sure I'm okay because as they say, ""You may almost be 20, but you're still our little boy"". The phone calls are annoying, but I love them so much for caring so much about me. And when I told my friends I got into BU, they all cheered, started screaming/shouting, bear hugged me off the ground, and congratulated me. What I'm trying to say is, no matter how far you go in life, never forget how you got there and WHO got you there. When life seems like it's in the shits, know that it gets better. I promise. Also, shoutout to Warren Towers, currently living there and it's honestly not even that bad.","#5135

long winded post, so I apologize: Back when I was a terrier, I did research at BU and had some of the worst experiences of my life. The grad student mentoring me constantly acted inappropriate. ""that skirt's a bit too short for this conference, don't you think?"" (it was a knee length skirt.) ""You want to learn Chinese? Why doesn't your brother teach you?"" (he died three months prior to this conversation, and I e-mailed the entire lab when it happened. She forgot?) I know for a fact I wasn't a poor performing undergrad: even when a police officer came to my room in StuVi to tell me my brother died, I went into lab to change the medium (food basically) on our cells before catching a flight back home.
Post doc in my lab was sexist (called me ""stupid woman"" among other things), and my PI didn't care what went down in lab. Even when I begged to make appointments to bring up these concerns, he never made the time.
Guess what? 2 years after graduating, I'm now in grad school and life is so much better. My new PI knows when to push me, and when to encourage me. I saw my old PI at a conference in Europe and got to prove how much better I perform when working in a respectful lab environment.
So to any terriers out there with a crappy work environment right now, I'm so sorry. I can empathize. Leave if you have the means. If you don't, hang in there- not everyone is an asshole. An amazing PI makes all the difference. I hope and pray all you Terriers will be able to find jobs where you are treated with respect <3","#5128

Honestly, if nothing good happens by my next birthday, I think I might just kill myself. I could probably drown in the charles river and no one would notice. Or I could run out into Comm Ave and get hit by a car cause that could be really quick. My whole life has been one big disappointment. Literally, the most exciting thing that every happened to me was maybe getting some ice cream for dinner, but then I would feel guilty not eating and would not eat anything the next day. I have never had a true friend to talk to and depend on, and I have never felt close with my family. I have dealt with rejection so many times I don't know if I should be frustrated or just stop trying.
I need just one friend. Just one. I just need someone I could talk to when I feel sad or happy about something. I feel so neglected from everyone I feel that no one cares about me. Maybe if I disappear off the face of this earth, then maybe people will notice me and care about me for once.","#5127

I'm better now bc of new meds and therapy, but this has made self harm and contemplate suicide. I'm also surrounded by a bunch of rich elitists, which just fucking hurts considering how wrecked my family is financially. It's honestly worse than high school.

Wrote a poem about a girl I saw while sitting outside the GSU and didn't have the guts to say hi to. I was writing poetry about a different subject at the time for a personal project so it kinda just felt right. I don't expect anything to come out of submitting this but I thought it was somewhat of an enjoyable read so maybe someone would get a kick out of it.
The Red Haired cellist
There sat a red haired cellist,
With grace, working under the gentle blue that matched her cello case,
I see her as I did mine,
and relapse into my idiotic routine.
I fall in love with the way her foot shakes,
with energy, ambition, music.
I fall in love with how she looks up at the people passing by,
humbly curious about those around.
The curiosity I held for her,
Just her,
at that moment.
I fell in love with how I saw familiarity,
and with it a person who could be a companion.
The scenarios start,
inquiries about her music, her work,
excuses.
The desire to catch her glance,
share a smile,
validate my idiocy.
It does not happen, until I passed,
find her eyes and hide mine,
with fear and self loathing.
I remind myself again,
I know nothing of this person,
I never will.
Every desire to see poetry meet reality is shot with fear then shame.
The questions begin,
The possibility, the opportunity,
the poetry.
I wonder and hate myself,
Why cant
I watch her walk away,
I mock myself,
How dare I take away her autonomy
Implant my desires,
How dare I be a romantic coward.

1) No one forces you to come to school. Even if you're forced to, you know that having education is better than not! This is a cost that you have to pay now for a more secure future
2) Complaining about how tired you are is such a privileged thing to do. Yeah, your little ass is tired, but your tiredness has a place to go back to -- a SAFE place to recharge, rest, eat, shower, watch Netflix, and etc. A lot of people are MORE EXHAUSTED THAN YOU ARE AND A LOT OF THEM DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY OF THESE.

I was so taken aback by the eye contact we made on Comm Ave that I thought one of the buttons on my coat was left open. The zipper is broken so I have to button it up all throughout winter. I was about to go up the stairs to StuVi one and heard someone yelling ""excuse me"" only to see that it was you. It all happened so fast so I don't remember everything you said but I do remember that you told me I looked very elegant. I was so nervous and I did not know what to say or even how to thank you for the compliment, so all I said was that I am taken by someone else. Even though this is true, I wish I had handled the situation differently or at least gotten your name. I have fantasized about this exact situation happening to me and I can't believe things like this really happen outside of movies. As soon as I stepped into my apartment, I turned right back around and went downstairs to see if you were still there. Of course, you were gone. I cried afterwards because the whole situation made me second guess the relationship that I've been in for almost two years now. I hope we cross paths again one day.","#5077

I also got to participate in multiple internships at many great companies, despite not being the best candidate for any of them. Therefore, I haven't asked out a girl since, and I have done my best to avoid situations that could lead to anything romantic.

So there was this guy. We clicked immediately. We went into the city and I introduced him to the wonderful world of Converse and picked a pair out for him. We watched The Dark Night and snuggled. We went out for a two-hour midnight walk. I spilled my guts about my life, every excruciating detail. I texted him to hang out, planning to DTR, and he told me to come smoke with him. I never smoke, but I did with him. We cuddled for the next seven hours. I thought we were both catching feelings. Days later, I was stranded in the rain, totally soaked. I asked if I could come because I wanted dry clothes and a nearby place to sleep. He invited me over. We listened to a song that said ""do something crazy,"" and he then told me to ""do something crazy."" Needless to say, I had never before gone so far with a guy. The next morning, he sweetly asked if he could kiss me before I left.
We finally got to DTR and after pouring my heart out, he said ""I'm really glad that we are good friends..."" I fell hard and he knows too much, so I can't just cut him out. First experience with a f*ckboi, I may not regret the hookup, but I regret the emotional connection. Every time I see him, he is wearing those exact converse...","#5057
So there was this guy. We clicked immediately. We went into the city and I introduced him to the wonderful world of Converse and picked a pair out for him. We watched The Dark Night and snuggled. We went out for a two-hour midnight walk. I spilled my guts about my life, every excruciating detail. I texted him to hang out, planning to DTR, and he told me to come smoke with him. I never smoke, but I did with him. We cuddled for the next seven hours. I thought we were both catching feelings. Days later, I was stranded in the rain, totally soaked. I asked if I could come because I wanted dry clothes and a nearby place to sleep. He invited me over. We listened to a song that said ""do something crazy,"" and he then told me to ""do something crazy."" Needless to say, I had never before gone so far with a guy. The next morning, he sweetly asked if he could kiss me before I left.

My parents are wonderful people and I respect them. They are not racist, sexist, or homophobic. Heck, they're pretty liberal socially: pro-choice, LGBTQ supporters, and think every human deserves health care. But when it comes to many economic policies, they are conservative. And they voted for Trump.
I know it's their choice, but I wish I had tried harder to stop them. I wish they had truly understood the negative impact that a Trump presidency could have on so many people's lives. They refused to vote for Hillary because of her email scandal but voted for Trump despite his hateful rhetoric, and I am confused.

To all of the people calling those who voted for trump racists, bigots, misogynists, and other such terms, realize you are partly to blame for the outcome of this election. Some of these people who voted for trump had real concerns (whether these concerns were unfounded or not is not the point of this post. The fact is, real or imagined, these concerns were real to the people involved). However, when these people voiced their opinions and concerns, they were called racists, bigots, misogynists, ignored, told they didn't have real issues, or told their opinions don't manner. Do you honestly think saying those things to someone is going to get them to change their views? If anything, using such terms builds resentment, creates a sharper divide, and pushes people (who now feel angry, in addition to any previous feelings) further into the hands of someone like trump, who sympathizes with these people. Instead of calling people racists, bigots, etc., how about doing something constructive like acknowledging the concerns and viewpoints of others and having a level-headed discussion about them? If anything else, agree to disagree and don't fuel the fire by using insulting terms. It only makes things worse.","#5032

Hi! I'm a senior with 0 friends.
Yeah so, I've never had any friends to go out with, to study with, to even have meals with at the dining hall. I kind of saw this coming as a freshman because I am a very quiet girl but I didn't think that 4 years later, I would still have no proper relationships. I'm not even kidding.There's not a single person on campus that I can call up.
How is this possible? How could you not meet anybody?
...Well, I'm useless/disinterested with most things so clubs are out. I'm super scared of auditions and I'm not interested in joining any club where a group of people only talk to each other and do nothing but smile at me awkwardly.
I had 2 crappy roommates, but it must have been myself for not letting them in my life. I never felt at home in my dorm and I'm too scared to go out alone to parties because I have a habit of making bad decisions when no one is around....
I try to talk more with people in class but nobody ever wants to do anything other than work on group projects. Friend zoned? More like 'class zoned'.
It's my fault. I know. I have pushed people away, only because I didn't think they wanted to be near me. It's not even like I have good grades or amazing work experience.
Truth is: I'm in an s&m relationship with a guy who doesn't want anything more. I was addicted to him and I think that really screwed up any other type of potential relationship for me.
It only makes me wonder what the fuck I'm going to do on my own after college.","#5024

Yeah so, I've never had any friends to go out with, to study with, to even have meals with at the dining hall. I kind of saw this coming as a freshman because I am a very quiet girl but I didn't think that 4 years later, I would still have no proper relationships. I'm not even kidding.There's not a single person on campus that I can call up.
How is this possible? How could you not meet anybody?
...Well, I'm useless/disinterested with most things so clubs are out. I'm super scared of auditions and I'm not interested in joining any club where a group of people only talk to each other and do nothing but smile at me awkwardly.
I had 2 crappy roommates, but it must have been myself for not letting them in my life. I never felt at home in my dorm and I'm too scared to go out alone to parties because I have a habit of making bad decisions when no one is around....
I try to talk more with people in class but nobody ever wants to do anything other than work on group projects. Friend zoned? More like 'class zoned'.
It's my fault. I know. I have pushed people away, only because I didn't think they wanted to be near me. It's not even like I have good grades or amazing work experience.
Truth is: I'm in an s&m relationship with a guy who doesn't want anything more. I was addicted to him and I think that really screwed up any other type of potential relationship for me.
It only makes me wonder what the fuck I'm going to do on my own after college.",,1478635850,,,14,4,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1174598545939368&id=455239657875264,

One time when I was in first year, my roommate was gone so I started jacking off to some (gay) porn, and because I wasn't thinking I faced away from my door with my computer screen facing it. I had earphones in and was really going at it with myself when I heard someone's throat clear behind me. It was my roommate who was with his brother and both of them were staring at me wide eyed. I quickly closed my computer, pulled up my pants, nodded at them and ran out. My roommate and I barely talked after that incident, and maybe he forgot about it, but I will forever be mortified.","#5023

OK guys this is a screening test for depression. If you're reading this post, then for the love of god stop scrolling through facebook and complete this evaluation. Seriously, it takes, like, a minute. There are no excuses here. Even if you’re positive nothing’s wrong.
I’m posting this because I know it can be hard for people with depression to recognize that the way they’re feeling isn’t normal or healthy, and make the first move towards getting help. I have depression and it sucks, but not nearly as much as it did before I’d been diagnosed. So just take this screening test already! You owe it to yourself. And you owe it to me, because even if we don't know each other, you're part of the BU community and I care about you!""

""As someone who has been clinically depressed since 8, it's heartbreaking to see people silently suffer and trudge on alone. I still struggle with depression to this day and it has definitely affected my academic performance as well as my social life in general. I'm not exactly a person with a plethora of friends, but I do have a small circle of friends that are there for me most times. I will say that I have attempted suicide three times in my life; if that's too dark to make this a confession, then I'd be rather disappointed. Here's some general lessons I've learned through my struggles:
You cannot tell someone to just """"be happy"""". It's really not that easy. And if you are the type of person who will get angry because your depressed friend """"won't snap out of it"""", then please just don't impose yourself on them and refer them to someone else. I've lost a number of friends because they just can't fathom what it's like to struggle to wake up and to have just this dull ache of meaningless loneliness. As a result, they just became livid and that deteriorated our friendship. I've come to learn that depressive episodes, for however long they last, are slightly better when someone is just there for me. They don't have to say or fix anything. I know it's something that time fixes, or if it gets really bad I will call for professional help. But the company matters SO much. I'm not asking you to open the door for me, just walk through with me.
On the other hand, if you are suffering from depression this is what I've learned: some friends can't handle listening to your issues. It's a harsh truth. As much as people tend to flaunt as knights of kindness, the """"oh I'm here for you to talk"""" people, there are a lot of people that aren't equip to actually handle severe issues. Given my past is pretty atypical - from having to purge a criminal record for a crime I didn't commit but had 'friends' that decided I was the scapegoat, being admitted to a psychiatric hospital during high school, and having a semi broken family that """"doesn't believe in depression"""", I can honestly say that it's VERY difficult to find the right person to vent to. I've gone through 2 psychiatrists, and 3 therapists. BU has been pretty damn useless as when I went in for my appointment, I was basically told """"we don't know what to do with you. You got a lot of issues. I'm going to refer you to someone else."""" Three transfers within BU's SHS and the last one I just didn't go to. I won't lie. The general vibe I get from a lot of professional therapists is that they expect some textbook symptoms and some magic answer. Most of my therapists have been rather disrespectful or simply just misunderstood me. I've been diagnosed with so many different things ranging from ASPD, MDD, to even """"it's just a phase"""". One therapist basically told me to """"be happier"""". So while this sounds dismal, it is not hopeless. I've found peace with dealing with my own issues as best as I can. The best I've heard of depression is that it is that form of darkness that you just have to rise up and fight against. And I do. It exhausts the fuck out of me and every day is a fight.
Personally, I've declined taking any medication as my depression is generally moderate. I will heavily vouch for REBT therapy; any kind of positive outlook has been extremely successful in my attempts to stifle an episode. Sometimes, I think myself into a deeper depression, telling myself that positive outlooks are just whimsy hopes for something that isn't real. Sometimes, I avoid thinking positively because I think I'd be lying to myself if I do. However, this is the most important lesson that I've learned from depression: it will pass. And if you are struggling as bad as I have, if you've felt like you've been robbed of all the color in the world, of all the taste in your food, if you've contemplated suicide on a daily basis, please remember that you are not alone. Depression isn't something you can sweep under your list of priorities. Depression isn't something that comes after grades. Depression is something you need to address right now. This is a fight you have to face, so please cut that fucker out of your life. And I say this wholeheartedly, but Fuck. Depression. Get up. Research natural antidepressants. Cold showers. Exercise. Get your ass up and shower and go eat. If that's not enough, find a friend, a real friend, to talk to - but don't expect answers. Just company. If you need answers, then please seek professional help. And don't be afraid to discontinue therapy if it's not working for you. Find the right person, and even then, they don't have the answers. You have the answers. The main goal of a therapist is to help guide you to find the answers. You have to walk through that door because it is your life. Depression will always be the most difficult obstacle in our lives. But we have to do it. Because life is precious.""","#4976

And in the middle of that trip to the hospital, I realized how scary it must have been for that person who got me the help I needed. So if that person who saved my life is reading this, thank you.

Dear neighbors who live below us,
My roommate and I would kind of like to apologize. We know that we must be the worst. Yes, the other night we were tap dancing. Earlier in the year we were trying to dance like Cossacks, which lead to us falling most of the time. Thank you for your patience. Tomorrow we may try to reenact our favorite scenes from STOMP.

Hi Prospective students! For those of you who don't have a lot of parental $$$upport, go to the financial aid office and tell them you can't afford to take out so much in loans. Ask about the return on investment and the actual average salary of alums in your program. If the number of decades required to pay back the loan is too high for you, tell them. There is a GOOD chance they have a lot of scholarship money waiting for someone to ask for it.
Honestly, tuition is severely inflated and the only people they expect to pay the sticker price are people who have a lot of money to spare, and suckers.","#4955

I am a student at BU and I am from Istanbul, Turkey. Recently we've had bombs monthly in our capital Ankara and our large city istanbul. I am not going to rant about people not changing their profile pictures to the turkish flag or facebook not giving us the option to. To be honest, Im sure I speak for many when I say I couldnt care less about that flag stuff on facebook. Its just a post, and unfortunately for many people, its just to make it seem like you are into world affairs. What I am going to talk about is how not one of my American friends here at a school I have been at for years has asked me how I feel about about my home city and a district where I spent my childhood being bombed by a suicide bomber. A couple friends who are in IR have acknowledged it or a couple who were going to come to Turkey have changed plans and that is completely understandable. But nobody talks about or asks about feeling. I recall a post on BU confessions where a French girl was angry because on the monday after the Paris attacks her friends at BU, simply asked ""what were you up to this weekend?"" This was a day after her fellow citizens in Paris were in a blood bath. It is as if many people here are oblivious to reality and the violence and challenges others face. And even if they are not oblivious, they are inable to talk about something with substance. They are unable to look in our eyes and ask ""how do you feel?"" Or ""are you ok?"" Or ""i cant imagine how it feels to have your home bombed."" I do not know what to attribute this loss in intimacy to. Maybe it is facebook and twitter because everything going on in the World has simply become a post for people to like or MAYBE fully read. then you just continue scrolling or you turn it off and watch netflix or do whatever else without thinking to talk to your friends who are affected. This summer when I graduate I am going back to my home where I will be scared to take the subway, go to our amazing squares and streets, and even see a movie at a mall. But no one has the ability to talk about it with me even though they all know exactly where I am from and how much I love my home. It doesnt matter if its Istanbul, Paris, Baghdad, Damascus, Bogota, Beirut or anywhere else in the world. A bomb is a bomb, death is death, a home is a home and an international student being at BU does not mean they are spiritually away from thier home, even though currently they may be in the unicorn-rainbowland that is the US or Canada. So I urge you please, if you have a friend that is from a place that is facing this kind of unspeakable violence and terrorism at home on their very doorstep, look at them, put your hand on their shoulder, show them you actually care about them and just ask what they are feeling. Dont let social media take the intimacy out of your lives and as students of a progressive, liberal, egalitarian school, prove that you dont live in a bubble and that you are capable of empathy.","#4955

Ladies of BU, I have something to say and I mean this with good intentions. I know some of you, uh, struggle to get the flow going in the bathroom, especially when others are in it too. Turns out a lot of you are nervous pee-ers. Now, that's fine and all, but here's the thing: when classes let out and I have 10 minutes to empty my bladder and get down campus, a lot of you get there ahead of me and you end up just staying in that stall for the full 10 minutes, just waiting for people to get out of the bathroom so you can pee. Several people do this in each restroom, so there's usually only 1 or 2 stalls for other people to actually use. YES, we do notice you've been in that stall for 10 minutes. YES we are annoyed at you. NO we won't think badly of you if we hear you pee. I'm sorry you feel uncomfortable, but we need a solution. So, maybe if you know you are a nervous pee-er, please don't use the bathroom during that 10 minute rush? That or learn to pee freely. I know you're shy and this confession is blunt, but I'm really sick of staring at your designer shoes under the stall for 10 minutes while I wait with a full bladder with 8 people behind me.","#4946

I gotta be honest here. I'm in the middle of my sophomore semester and so far I feel like I've learned nothing of value. I'm a business major, so I don't know if it's because we have to complete required classes before we can really take business electives or any other for that matter, but I wonder if other people (even of different majors) have felt this way. Is it because most of the stuff we've done isn't hands on learning? Is it that I'm disinterested? Or maybe I made a mistake in choosing some of professors? I don't know. As I've gotten older, I've started feeling more disappointed about not having learned much rather than receiving an undesirable grade. At least if I get a subpar grade in a class I've learned a lot in, I'll feel accomplished. But the times I've gotten decent grades in a class, I've felt like there was nothing engaging about the class. Just trying to see if I'm not the only one that feels this way. I come here to learn, not to try to achieve a certain grade. It's not high school anymore.","#4929

It's stressful, we learn nothing because we're too busy trying to finish the ridiculously long assignments (which are usually focused on one tiny topic), and group members are always disagreeing with each other. I also don't understand why many group members have to be so rude all the time, even during the first meeting. Sure, maybe they have their reasons, but guess what? We all have problems. There's not a single person who doesn't. So please, don't be an ass with a ""fuck all of you"" attitude. Just be nice to your other group members. Be nice to each other. It's not that hard, and it will make the experience more enjoyable.

""First, I would like to say that I like to start out every day positively. However, this usually is quickly ruined in a """"0-100"""" fashion by the poor etiquette displayed on the BU Shuttle. For this reason, I have decided to try to inform the general Boston University public about the proper etiquette for both the Shuttle and the pedestrian highway that is known to us all as Commonwealth Avenue.
BU Shuttle Etiquette:
As we all know, the BU Shuttle is a resource in which most of us indulge. You're in West Campus and you want to get to East or Central Campus somewhat quickly, yeah, you hop on the Shuttle.
In the mornings at the StuVi II is where problems arise. This morning at 9:05am, I tried to get on the 9:10am Shuttle that already seemed to be filled. Upon further inspection, I saw that people located in the middle of the bus were extremely comfortable, with PLENTY of space to readjust and move in. When asked to do so, my roommate and I were ignored. As a result, we were both pressed against the door as the shuttle pulled away from StuVi II.
Let me tell you why this is poor etiquette. Why must I, and a few others, be pressed unsafely against the doors with backpacks pushed in our faces [I am 5'4] while others comfortably stand with space to move in? I understand that you may pride yourself in arriving earlier than I and the others did, but I do believe that I pay tuition here just as everyone else does, which in my opinion, means I should be able to safely ride the shuttle and get to class at a reasonable time. Is it too much to ask? At least take your backpacks off. It's just considerate, y'know? I know we're all tired in the morning and I know it's not fun to be pushed by those of us on the edges, but we are all in this struggle together, as my roommate said this morning. I don't WANT to be that person to shove people in because my cries are being ignored! Help your fellow peers out. Help ME out.
Be. Kinder. Humans.
Commonwealth Avenue Pedestrian Highway Etiquette:
I want to keep this short and sweet. Like a highway, there are fast moving human vehicles walking the Comm. Ave highway so you must accelerate at the speed of traffic. Don't cut people off and slow down. It just causes traffic, irritation, and road rage. Comm. Ave is a 4-lane pedestrian road. This means that 2 lanes go westbound and 2 lanes go eastbound. Do not try to change the rules of the road by forcing a 4-lane one-way. We are all trying to get somewhere. Let's be more considerate. Please.
Rant over.""","#4913

So one day I was with one of my friends at the GSU waiting for others to show up. We started talking about where I'm from and a person at another table next to ours mentions that he grew up there for a little bit. When I tell him my major he ends up having the same one and proceeds to talk to me about Blackfish (the documentary). All normal. What's weird is when he decided to show me a screenplay idea he had for a movie. He took out pictures (that he drew himself) of whales, dolphins, and sharks that came back in time to molest and fuck humans basically. I just was standing there in awe as he pulled out at least 20 pictures of this stuff.
TL;DR I met a guy who probably gets off to whale porn","#4899

So, around 10:30pm today, i was taking a walk outside of mugar and then while i was coming back in, i saw a body of a sparrow right outside the gsu door. it was still breathing and it seemed to be shivering so I gently scooped it up and brought it in the gsu.
It seemed to be shivering a bit so i kept it inside my palms and tried to keep it warm. I texted my friend about it and she said to bring it back to the library cuz it prolly won't fly away. so we sneaked it up and propped it on her sweater. it was there for about a good 20 minutes and then it suddenly flew away. inside mugar library, on the third floor. we tried looking for it but never found it.
tl;dr, theres a sparrow somewhere on the third floor of mugar","#4855

I don't think people at this school necessarily appreciate what they have right now. As I go through my fourth year of college and I look at the hourglass and how the sand seems to indicate time is almost up, I just get sad. There's really nothing outside of college for me right now that would make me happier than I am right now; I am perfectly happy where I am right now. It seems to me that Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" wasn't so much an allegory for the english monarchy as it is a direct interpretation of how it feels to graduate college in our time. I am a senior right now and I am very sad to say that I dread the day that I will have to leave this place. Make the best of your 4 years y'all. They go by pretty fast.","#4861

The sense of entitlement of SOME of the science kids here is appalling. I have not spoken to one ""friend"" in weeks because no matter what conversation is had, she always brings up how hard her classes are, how awful her upcoming assignments/exams are, and how late she stayed up (though she waits until evening to start studying...) If I try to get rid of academic banter completely, she still brings it around to how awful her life is and how easy everyone who is not a science kid has it. She downplays any problems or unfortunate mishaps of anyone but herself, always responding to others' bad days with something whose overlying theme is ""your day wasn't even that bad. my day was worse, mine is always worse"". She chose her major. She clearly hates it and is miserable. She won't change her major because imho she doesn't want to lose the ""pity me"" affect. If what you're doing is not sustainable now (your studies, sleep habits, career) then it is not going to be sustainable in the long run.

I started to notice that the people cheating (whether it was on their phones or with extra papers on their desks) were student athletes. I realize that you have busy schedules, but in no way does that mean you should cheat. Yes, things like this happen in the real world and yes, I really should get used to it and not be an annoying person, but if you can't handle the schoolwork than maybe you shouldn't be on an athletic team. If this is interfering with your studies than maybe you should re-evaluate. And maybe you're here on an athletic scholarship and congrats to you, but realize that you have more than just that. You shouldn't take the risk that you could get caught but also make other classmates who don't cheat suffer when grades can could potentially be curved. End rant.","#4782

Honestly, finals aren't that bad. There's a ton of people complaining on all forms of social media about it, but really it seems the majority of these people complaining simply aren't good students. If one takes the time throughout the semester to go over notes, actually do the reading, to use office hours and to ensure understanding of the course concepts, finals become simply a time of another round of exams. Sure, you still have to review content from the semester, but if you actually made the effort to learn it in the first place, its really not that bad.
Its not high school anymore. Either put in the effort as a full time student, or stop bitching when finals come around and you're unprepared.

So I failed my finals today and there is a very real chance I flunk out of this school. I don't know how to handle it really, it is a feeling of depression that is extremely hard to explain, it almost feels suicidal. I hate business and just want to get out of here with a degree, but I don't really know what I will do if I end up flunking out. I come from a well off family, so the thought of flunking out of college is just too depressing to handle. I have never once felt like giving up before, but I really do feel like jumping out of the Stuvi study lounge right now. I'm kinda just venting right now, but this feeling of derpession is extremely hard to handle.","#4764

Many things about your post annoyed me, but above all was the fact that you were specifically talking about girls. It appears that it doesn't bother you if guys are overweight, which makes you sexist in addition to an asshole and just goes to show that this sentiment is probably visually driven and you just don't want to have to look at fat people.
Also, people can love their bodies regardless of size or shape and it's none of your business. Just because you personally don't like to see bigger bodies doesn't mean you can be an ass about it. Just because you work out and eat healthy doesn't mean you love your body and it certainly doesn't make you any better than someone who doesn't.","#4723

I'm a junior and I'm about to drop out. More like flunk out. I was placed on academic probation this semester and dropped a class early so the pressure was even more intense considering I needed to make the best out of the three courses I was still taking. I even got the official email saying my grades will be reviewed at the end of the semester to determine my status at BU. I've missed so many classes due to depression and anxiety, so staying here is definitely not an option. I haven't told most of my friends or any of my family. I was told multiple times (by friends, family, even a couple of my professors) to take a break or leave of absence this semester but I didn't because I was dumb enough to believe in myself, to believe I could actually do something right. I guess I should've listened. I guess I should've gone to therapy and taken my medication on a regular basis. But that doesn't matter now, because I fucked up and it's irreversible.
I often say I hate life, I hate Boston, but honestly I just hate myself. I've considered suicide, PLENTY of times within the past couple years but I can't do that to people who actually give a fuck about me. So now I'm just a (soon-to-be) depressed college dropout with no hope for anything relatively positive in the future.

Last semester was a nightmare for me, I always deal with intense anxiety, but my anxiety and depression was extreme; I suffered from panic attacks that turned into episodes and I almost took my own life twice. I wish I could say that BU helped, but communicating with SHS and BU police only exacerbated my symptoms. I'm not saying don't seek help from them if you need it (PLEASE DO-especially if you are in an emergency), but just that there are other options too-- you can get help from private psychologists and psychiatrists, who will remain 100% confidential and whose only job is to support you. I know it may seem impossible to reach out for help because it seems like admitting defeat, but think of it as taking charge; give yourself a chance and know you are NOT weak. We all have darkness inside of us, and depression can be all-consuming, but know: there are people who understand your struggle, who won't judge you, and only want you to be happy.
In the process, I learned who my real friends are, and that even when everyday feels heavy and dark you can keep going, and its not forever. I don't suffer from depression as severely anymore, maybe its due to having studied abroad and getting a change in environment, some repaired relationships and letting go of those not worth repair, accepting my flaws, not taking on more than I can handle, or growing to understand my anxiety more. I know for some people symptoms don't go away, I sometimes still think about what it would be like to just disappear, but its important to face these thoughts head on, realize that they are real and valid feelings and take action to get help.
If you are a friend of someone who seems to be suffering from these kinds of thoughts or even know someone who seems anxious, always be gracious and understanding. I was very surprised to see many people who I thought were my best friends walk away at the first sign that I was suffering from something bigger than a bad grade for a couple months. More importantly, I was incredibly grateful for those who I didn't think I was that close with continue you to love and respect me in the same way they had before, despite everything. I'm not saying that you need to be their entire support system, but don't walk away just because it's something you don't understand--support comes in all forms. Please encourage that they seek professional help, but be kind-- a genuine smile can go a long way.","#4684

To whom it may concern;
I flunked out of BU.
After a good first semester with mostly A's and B's I ran into a wall my second semester. I know now that it was mostly because I was overloading with 18 credits like a moron.
Depression hit me fast and kind of pushed me into a corner. I came face to face with the possibility of throwing myself into traffic. That experience scared the shit out of me.
During my third semester and over the summer I really tried hard to keep myself from that reality ever again, oftentimes lulling myself into a fantasy state of mind where not going to classes and not doing homework was 'alright' and that I was going to be 'alright'.
I'm now almost 2 semesters in at a community college, with my GPA struggling in the sub-2 region, hating the fact that I couldn't put my shit together in time to keep one of the best things I had ever worked for, in reality the thing I had worked all my life to that point for. The fact that, for the most part, I have completely abandoned my friends also kinda eats at me too.

Last fall, I met someone who I thought I was truly meant to be with. The feeling of joy and closeness with that person made my life at BU so memorable and worthwhile. With every kiss and laugh shared between us, everything felt right with him. No matter my imperfections, he insisted he was perfectly happy being with me. He promised me that our relationship was far more important than any test grade or internship application because as long as we had each other, everything would somehow work out, everything would be OK. And with every day spent with him, I put all my trust and faith in that promise because I cared so deeply about him.
But then, everything that felt so right eventually fell apart. The I love you's disappeared. The laughter between us grew infrequent. Quality time became lunch appointments. Intimate conversations became sarcastic comments. Suddenly, I felt like a minuscule and unimportant part of his increasingly busy life. There were nights I cried in pathetic loneliness, wondering why I felt so miserable when he seemed so happy and preoccupied with his life, oblivious to how I felt. I poured so much energy into trying to make our relationship last when I finally found I was fed up with the way he treated me in return. I knew I was more important than a test score, and I didn't need him to validate that for me. Reality solemnly soaked in: it was over. He didn't love me the way I still did, and I had to let those feelings go.
Looking back a year later after meeting him, I am finally happy with where I am with my life despite the bitterness and frustration I experienced trying to move on from ending things. The future that looked so uncertain to me seven or eight months ago is finally starting to clear up and look bright. I have seen and experienced incredible things in my life after the pain finally passed, and I don't know if I would have achieved what I had this past summer if I was stuck wondering why things had to end the way they did. Having my expectations of love shattered was actually a blessing in disguise for me because I would have never developed a better understanding of who I am and what I want if I didn't take things into my own hands to make my life better for myself. Heartbreak hurts so much, but now I firmly believe that good things fall apart so better things can fall together.

They have white privilege because they are white. The ""I don't have white privilege because I'm poor"" argument is completely divorced from the conversation. In fact, using white privilege and a comment about wealth in the same sentence is a prime example of how clueless and PRIVILEGED you actually are to not understand the concept.

In the end, it really shouldn't be a competition to see who cares the most, as long as we are doing something to help. Something is better than nothing. Awareness is better than nothing. A conversation with your peers is better than nothing.

The students against silence people,
Don't you guys not get that what you guys are doing is totally counter-productive to the point you are trying to make. I understand your point. The impeachment was totally unnecessary. But is asking for the dismissal of all the senators and personally attacking them the solution? Isn't that the kind of hate you want to avoid?
Moreover, I understand that you want your senators to represent your views but how many of you ever went to a RHA event or general meeting? Did you even know your senators' names before this?
Really, please put an end to the victimizing and the endless protests! This is an issue that can be fixed but it won't happen instantly. Let's focus on real problems of the world.

Everyone keeps saying how they want these attacks to stop, the violence to stop, and for everything bad to stop. Well, let me clarify something for you: Sure, all these tragedies are awful, disgusting crimes against civilization, but what did you expect? Look around you - our world, our societies, our potential, they are all skyrocketing towards a marvelous future. A future so prosperous and incandescent that it is nearly impossible to describe. Everyday, normal people, such as you and I, create unimaginable inventions, gadgets, technologies, and ideas that rival the wonder of Greek myths. Our future...Our cornucopia of success is racing towards us at a speed never before seen in human history. However, such progress comes at a cost - ever-increasing resistance. Yes, the more we advance, the stronger the pushback will be. We live in a world so full of conflicting opinions and beliefs that in order to advance, society will make a lot of enemies. There are people in this world, such as terrorists, that would prefer our world to cease advancing, to cease alienating them. Their ideologies simply cannot survive in our new world. Either they will be suffocated or they will cannibalize themselves, but they will not survive. The consequent fear that arises within these people pushes them to commit such horrible acts - it is only natural human fight or flight behavior. I'm not saying ""get used to it"". I'm saying there is a bigger picture here. The violence? it will always be around, it will always follow us. That's the price we pay for wanting a better world. So, instead of simply altering your profile pic, typing an innane and insincere ""thoughts and prayers"" status, denouncing one ethnic group or another for causing terrorism, blaming immigrants, or being an overall *ahem* Piece o'Shit, how about you compliment someone instead? how about you practice more honesty from now on? You could even be more direct with people. Or do better in your job, your classes, your relationships, etc. Be a better version of yourself - that's how we win, that's how we've always won.","#4614

I hate the system of this world. 12+ years of school, another 4 years of college, if you're lucky you get a job, if not go to grad school. I'm a senior and I am terrified of what is going to happen after I graduate. My grades aren't that good and I am an international student, so its 5000 times more difficult for me to get a job. I hate studying and I want to be done studying, I want to work. I love working. I have 2 jobs right now and I feel more confident and happy working than going to school. If I don't get a job upon graduation, my next step is to go to grad school so that I don't have to go back home. But I don't want to study anymore. Junior year I realized my major is worthless, but it was too late to change anything then. I am a political science major and every job posting i see or career fair I go to, companies just want either business or technical/IT degrees.

I hate the system of this world. 12+ years of school, another 4 years of college, if you're lucky you get a job, if not go to grad school. I'm a senior and I am terrified of what is going to happen after I graduate. My grades aren't that good and I am an international student, so its 5000 times more difficult for me to get a job. I hate studying and I want to be done studying, I want to work. I love working. I have 2 jobs right now and I feel more confident and happy working than going to school. If I don't get a job upon graduation, my next step is to go to grad school so that I don't have to go back home. But I don't want to study anymore. Junior year I realized my major is worthless, but it was too late to change anything then. I am a political science major and every job posting i see or career fair I go to, companies just want either business or technical/IT degrees.

With everything terrible going on recently, I have felt more and more the need to say something that hopefully does something good on some scale. From the issues dealing with religion (Palestine, Israel, France), those dealing with race (Mizzou and many others), those dealing with sexism and intolerance, to those simply having a bad week or year or whatever, it seems now more than ever we could all do with a reminder and an assurance of a few things. I'm certainly no expert on much of anything, particularly these issues, so please pardon me if I have left something out. My hope is simply to speak to all of these in a way that will perhaps bring about some well deserved and needed comfort.
It is so easy today, in the age of technology, of nearly instant connection, to disconnect. It is so easy to become trapped in one's own head and one's own way of thinking. It is easy to see pure evil in those that act out of intolerance. By no means do I wish to defend any intolerant acts that have been committed, violent or otherwise. But I wish to point out that these acts ought to be reminders to look for the good in people. Many of the intolerant and violent and hateful people and groups in this world have convinced themselves that anyone unlike them, anyone different, is pure evil that must be eradicated or ignored or put down.
So, in my opinion, the best thing we can do to fight intolerance and hatred is to do just the opposite. To remember that every single person is really truly a human being, with his or her own thoughts and feelings and opinions, and ultimately, beyond all those things, simply someone that wants to feel loved and accepted, someone that wants to feel as though they are a part of everything, that they are not alive and here in vain- that they matter. And you do, we all do.
To many, I think, technology can feel like a source of isolation, like something that allows one to hide from interaction and from dealing with issues, like something that permits us to escape into a virtual world of our own shaping. But, to quote Charlie Chaplin, ""the aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people.""
So, as you are walking around today and in the future, try to remember that in everyone is good, but sometimes consistent hatred or belief of hatred can make that good more and more diminished until it is effectively gone. The best, and perhaps only thing, we can truly do at any moment, is to remember that these differences we so like to blow up as defining traits or the like, are in fact but tiny aspects of us. We are humans, we are a beautifully messy and unsure species that is together striving everyday to understand more about each other and the world we live in. If you take nothing else from all the tragic events that have been occurring, please just remember that you always have the power to love, accept, and forgive, no matter what religion, race, sex, gender or whatever else you are or identify as. I wish you all a wonderful day and hope that at least some of you take this to heart as a reminder of what we all know, but often forget.","#4598

I haven't written before but I need somewhere to vent this out. I have been struggling with depression for almost 7 years now and have had many ups and downs. Everything improved last year when I more or less realized that I should give less fucks about everything. But the interesting thing is that depression can hit anyone. I'm known to be a very happy and upbeat person among my friends. While that may have been me, I realized that especially recently it has been all fake. I have been told that I'm kind of winning at life and I can see how that can be true so I really feel like there is no reason to be depressed but I am and suicidal thoughts have reemerged. My biggest problem is that I keep this to myself. I openly and willing share many aspects of my life with people but the one thing I have almost never talked about was my depression. It's not something I feel like I can talk to about. I don't want to see some stranger to discuss it, even if it is their profession and I don't like talking to my friends/family because I feel like it is an added burden on them since they might not know what to say. I guess the purpose of my post is to bring up the fact that depression is not something that is easily seen and can affect anyone regardless of age, race, gender, creed or state of life.","#4595

Why does it matter that the two women impeached from student government were minorities? (I'm sorry, I mean ""women of color,"" because you know, people outside of liberal arts college campuses actually use that term.) For the record, I agree that they were wrongfully impeached based on their political views. What I don't understand is why so many kids protesting it have to make a point that they were minorities, as if that makes it so much worse even though race had nothing to do with the reason for impeachment, however invalid and biased it may be. Why is it that whenever something bad happens to someone who isn't a straight white male, race/gender/sexuality ALWAYS has to be brought up even if the issue at hand is completely unrelated to those things.

PLEASE guys. look both ways before you cross. don't run when there's a car less than 10 ft away or as the T is heading down the tracks. it's not worth the risk. just wait! be safe everyone and have a good rest of the semester",,1447434308,,,28,0,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=948594325206459&id=455239657875264,

The impeachment of those two members of Student Government is ridiculous. I think it is clear to most people that the claims of “clerical errors” are just a coverup for the true reasons: their political views.
About 2 weeks ago, I had a conversation with the accuser. He mentioned 3 individuals (VP of finance, VP of internal affairs, and the director of social affairs - the 3 members of Student government who share Pro-Palestinian ideals). When stating why he believed they should be impeached he said that it was because of their involvement in SJP. He claimed that the VP of finance’s presence at the SJP die-in was threatening and offensive to jewish members of Student government. (Fun fact: She wasn't even at the die-in, but even if she was...)
He then proceeded to show me a status posted by the VP of internal affairs that referred to the conditions of occupation and apartheid in Palestine. He had asked: ""Did you see the status she made on June 7th?"". My response was: ""Of course I don't know what she posted on June 7th, its October.""
It was around this time that a petition surfaced called Terriers Against Discrimination calling for the impeachment of the pro-Palestine members of StuGov. This petition was liked by several members of StuGov on Facebook.
The fact of the matter is this impeachment was COMPLETELY motivated by the suppression of Pro-Palestinian voices that Hillel students like the accuser are obsessed with. This has nothing to do with a budget report, note-taking, and missed meetings, because if that was the case wouldn't the accuser have said that to me when he was boasting about leading the impeachment initiative two weeks ago?
There are so many things to take away from this situation. First, criticism of the terrorist state of Israel does not equal anti-semitism. Zionism is not Judaism.
And most importantly, when the injustices took place in Apartheid South Africa, people were defending it too. When the Holocaust occurred, people were defending Hitler too. Don't be on the wrong side of history by defending the grave human rights violations committed by the state of Israel. Even if the truth isn't popular- as we've seen is the case at BU- don't let anyone tell you you can't speak the truth because they'll try to stop you by fabricating grounds for impeachment or whatever new tactic they conjure up to attempt to silence you but remember:
""They tried to bury us, they didn't know we were seeds""","#4563

I've always been a bit of a Nervous Nellie (childhood abuse will do that to you), but in the past year and a half, my anxiety has gotten worse.
I used to self harm (I did cut a couple of times, but my method of choice was usually giving myself small burns with hot water). Nobody knows about this except for a few very close friends who don't go to BU. I have been clean for almost 18 months now, and have promised myself that I would never relapse, but every time I get upset, the thought of starting again is really tempting. I do not want to burden my parents with this, because my brother is disabled and that takes up a lot of their time and energy already. They would probably call me ""selfish"" for being mentally ill (they already do for all sorts of minor shit, so imagine what they'd say if I came to them with this). I'm definitely not suicidal and I don't want to die, but I sometimes wonder if parents' lives would be a little easier if I did.","#4561

I was roofied my freshman year by someone who I thought was my friend. I blacked out before even leaving my dorm room, and proceeded to go out with some girls who lived down the hall. The next day they were laughing at how fucked up I was and they didn't even try to help me that night. They resented me because of how ""drunk"" I got but really I was drugged without my knowledge. That must have been the reason why I ran out of the party. A nice girl found me crying and sitting on the curb and brought me to her apartment. I'm not sure what happened after that, but I have a brief memory of being stranded deep in Allston, lost as fuck, still crying, and completely discombobulated, and a group of guys asked if I was okay and walked me back to my dorm. I am so lucky that I came out of this night unharmed. For many others, it can end in much worse. That's why it's so important to be safe and take care of one another. Thank you to those kind, random people who didn't even know me but literally saved my life that night. To the people who I thought were my friends, fuck you.

Dear #4513,
You're not alone. I too have had, by most standards, a privileged and nice life. Our family lives comfortably, parents able to support different interests in high school clubs and various sports, and maintain a close relationship with my parents and siblings. Yet despite this, I have yet to feel that I'm deserving of any of this life. If inadequate could be an emotion, that's what I feel all the time. Like you, I didn't suffer through any traumatic experiences. I just wanted you to know that there are others in the BU community that feel the same way. I have yet to see anyone at Behavioral Health, but I'm seriously considering making an appointment because I don't want to feel like this anymore.","#4521

There is a girl who is like a manager at the GSU named Jess. She was my server for Pinkberry and I have never had such a genuine smile and conversation with a worker as I did with her. She seemed actually interested in what I was studying and why.
Several days later I went back to the GSU for dinner and I watched as Jess was tossing salads at Loose Leafs.

Right before 10 o'clock I went up to Rhetts and ordered a frappe. Jess appeared again behind the ice cream area and carefully explained to the worker how to make a frappe. She was very good at giving directions and very patient and then when the student was done I came up and she remembered me from several days before. She remembered our conversation and asked how my organic chemistry exam went!

There is a girl who is like a manager at the GSU named Jess. She was my server for Pinkberry and I have never had such a genuine smile and conversation with a worker as I did with her. She seemed actually interested in what I was studying and why.
Several days later I went back to the GSU for dinner and I watched as Jess was tossing salads at Loose Leafs.

I'm an outwardly happy girl, with everything I could ever need in my life - my parents give me ample allowance, I have enough friends and social life, I'm goodlooking and I have nice clothes, I also do tons of enriching activities to keep myself busy. Yet, every night , every morning, as I lay in bed, I feel this inexplicable urge to burst into tears. I am very grateful for my privileged life, I know and appreciate everything that life has given me so far. Despite all that, I'm still very depressed. I don't think I'm deserving of anyone's love, and or anyone would ever love me truly.... My soul is in a dark dark place, and every morning I put on a mask and smile as hard as I can to brainwash myself into thinking I'm happy. I know I sound very pretentious right now, but I am actually not. I don't understand why I'm very much unhappy.","#4513

I get that race is an issue right now. I'm neither arguing with it or denying it. It's a problem that needs to be addressed.
But when it blinds you to the point that you dismiss anybody who is white or when you bring up race when it's not relevant to the conversation at all, I think that's when you stop and re-evaluate.
And before all of you pounce on me in the comments, I am not white, I am not male, I was not born with any privilege.

Last weekend we both got drunk and almost hooked up. This has happened a few times in the past but each time we would act like it never happened…I don't think we'll be able to sweep it under the rug this time.

I'm not saying everyone should have fancy dining etiquette while eating at school, but come on people, didn't your mom teach you to chew with your mouth closed?
Specifically, the international Asian students, from my observations, are the worst. I know that in some Asian countries it's polite to make noise while you eat, but you are in the USA now, you chose to come here, so at least adapt to what we consider to be basic manners so I don't have to become literally nauseous when I hear you eating your food like a little pig.

I know that in some Asian countries it's polite to make noise while you eat, but you are in the USA now, you chose to come here, so at least adapt to what we consider to be basic manners so I don't have to become literally nauseous when I hear you eating your food like a little pig.

A friend and I had an adventure in Marciano involving staying after hours for some softcore delinquency. You see, we met up at the dining hall a tick after 8:30pm. Just a standard dinner with standard conversation. Seeing as we met up fairly late, our conversations led us past “closing,” i.e. 9:00. Then it was 10:00. Not long after, 11:00 encroached and the lights shut off. Huh. Darkness. One would think that at least one staff member would do a walk-though of the entire dining hall before explicitly closing, asking any lingering students to leave, but no. Not a single person requested that we pick up our belongings and head off. 11:00, lights off, no warning. But we stayed, carrying our conversation on in the darkness. We got up to leave not long after, having determined long ago that any remaining students or staff were gone. As we approached the stairs, we spotted something. A display fruit. A boon in the distance, a lone pineapple beaconed from the exhibition sauté station. Its spiky canopy of fibrous leave topped the rough yellow-orange carapace securely containing delicate, acidic bliss. Truly delectable. And it was within reach! Oh, was it certainly within reach. Only thing was, as we made our way over, the chair-stacking crew had just arrived and began the arduous task of stacking all the chairs. Literally all the chairs. No chair would go unstacked as long as they could help it. Seeing as there were chairs on the second level of the dining hall, it was only a matter of time before they came up the stairs to where we were. Obviously this wouldn’t ordinarily be a problem, but we were there two hours after closing (I would like to reinstate that no one had asked us to leave). And, unfortunately for my friend and I, they were people with eyes that could see, so chances are they would see us if we were in front of said eyes that could see. Eyes tend to do that. See, I mean. Not to deny the existence of blind people; that would be ignorantly cruel. No, no, I am not one do so something so low. Taking a pineapple is more something I would do. Oh, and how about that? There was a pineapple right there. Granted, I was not the one to take the pineapple. Rather, it was my friend who resolved to do it, handing me a laptop bag and ducking low to avoid the viewing range of the seeing eyes. After stuffing it into a bag and sneaking back over to my cover, we decided to finally head off. We were largely unsure of what would happen once we descended the staircase. Going down meant meeting the unavoidable gaze of the chair-stackers. Given that it was unavoidable, we decided to cut our losses and depart before overstaying our welcome even more than we already had. We quickly descended, avoiding any and all eye contact with the chair-stackers, and headed towards the nearest exit. Rather than exiting the building, however, we went down to Rize and claimed a table. Eventually the suggestion came up that we attempt to eat the pineapple right there, right then. Ah yes, eat the fruit in the very place we took it from. Brilliant idea. Deliciously spiteful. But it’s a goddamn pineapple and all we had were a copious quantity of flimsy, serrated, plastic knives. I grabbed one and my friend made a sample stab. It went through. It. Went. Through. To the surprise of all, that plastic knife miraculously pierced the carapace of the tropical fruit. At that note, it was understood there was work to be done. Making haste, I prepared an operating surface consisting of layers of napkins. My friend made the first cut, the cutlery boring into the oozing yellow flesh like a slow-roasted ham. The first segment came loose. Then another. We grabbed at each piece as it separated from the main body of the pineapple, taking turns with the knife, trying to sate our gluttonic hunger of our shared prize. We ate between laughs, verbalizing our mutual disbelief at our situation, going through the events leading up to that moment and laughing. An hour or so passed before we heard them. *clack*…*clack*…*slam* The chair-stackers. They were right there. They came out from the Late Night Café and there were coming right towards us. I should have known. After all, we were sitting in chairs, and wherever there are chairs, that is where the chair-stackers will be. Mind you, they were same staff who saw us depart from the dining hall long after closing. In their eyes that can see, who knew what two kids could have been doing up there, so late and alone in the dark. Evidently they had taken a pineapple and were eating it, piece by piece, like the savage college students they are. They glared. I know. I turned my gaze to their seeing eyes and they glared. They said nothing, but the eyes said it all. Not because their eyes could speak, of course. That would be silly. Almost as silly as taking a pineapple and eating it in the basement level of the same building it was taking from, which, mind you, is quite silly. My friend and I quickly cleaned up the juice soaked worktable, making haste to leave the room and by extension the building. Actually, we probably should have left the building in the first place instead of taking the pineapple downstairs, just waiting to get caught. Oops. So, having cleaned up, we started to leave, but not before a confrontation with whom I would expect to be a manager of sorts. He turned to me and started, “Did you get that pineapple from the dining hall?” Unsure of the best response, I replied, “Uh…Yes? It was a display fruit.” “…” “Should we not take display fruits?” “Well, that’s an entire pineapple.” I looked down at the two thirds of pineapple carcass that remained, a unmaskable crater at the center of the fruit with a knife artfully balanced on the rim of the juice-filled cavity. “…Well. At least we know not to take anything in the future.” “…Good.” True, what I cradled in my hands was in fact an entire pineapple. I’ll give him that much. But honestly? It’s a display fruit. It is food. In a dining hall. Out in the open. I’m pretty sure it’s basically expected protocol to take food in a dining hall that is out in open, large fruit or not. So whatever, we were free to go. No names written down, no ID numbers recorded. We just walked briskly and left. Still though, we had two thirds of a surprisingly fresh pineapple and we weren’t done there. Oh god no, that was most certainly not going to waste. We earned that fruit, the tangible result of our resolution and risk-taking. Quite juicy, too, at that. So valuable. Naturally, we relocated to one the nearest residence lounges, being Towers. (Because Shelton is way too obvious.) We swiped in, pineapple and all, made our way to the recycling bins to scavenge for an eating surface which turned out being a discarded shoebox (oh, so classy), headed over to the lounge to set up base, set the box on a table and a layer of napkins within the box, placed the pineapple down, and continued to tear away at it in the newfound security of our setting. The moral of this little anecdote is that eating half a pineapple STINGS. Also you probably shouldn’t flaunt pilfered wares in the same place you took them from.","#4463

My roommate throws out an insane amount of perfectly good food every day, and I'm getting more and more infuriated.

You are making Israel sound like the victim in this situation. Do you even know how many Palestinians have been killed & tortured compared to Israelis, YOU need to do your research. Palestinians don't even have their own home or country and Israeli's are afraid of being bombed? Most Israeli's want to live in peace? That is fucking hilarious. YES they want to live in peace at the expense of other humans. Have you seen the pictures of babies torn apart and buried under the destruction of buildings? They kill people, pregnant women, for FUN. They throw pig intestines on Palestinians. Such a great country/people right? Read the the comments - who gave the UN the authority to give foreign settlers the right to take over a territory where people were already living? You are protecting yourself from what? People revolting because YOU kicked them out of their own homes? LOL, that is fucking ridiculous, maybe they should just be happy with being kicked out instead. I am not Arab, Muslim, Palestinian or Jewish and I have many friends who are Jewish and I don't have a problem with them. But what I have a problem with is their ignorance, just like yours. You (Israelis) think you have such a great country but you COMPLETELY ignore all the horrible atrocities you have been committing. You are doing exactly what Hitler did to the Jews. You know how it felt, so why are you doing it to others? There is no excuse or justification of what you have done. And cut the bullshit that Israel lives in fear, Palestinians fight for their lives every single day.

You are making Israel sound like the victim in this situation. Do you even know how many Palestinians have been killed & tortured compared to Israelis, YOU need to do your research. Palestinians don't even have their own home or country and Israeli's are afraid of being bombed? Most Israeli's want to live in peace? That is fucking hilarious. YES they want to live in peace at the expense of other humans. Have you seen the pictures of babies torn apart and buried under the destruction of buildings? They kill people, pregnant women, for FUN. They throw pig intestines on Palestinians. Such a great country/people right? Read the the comments - who gave the UN the authority to give foreign settlers the right to take over a territory where people were already living? You are protecting yourself from what? People revolting because YOU kicked them out of their own homes? LOL, that is fucking ridiculous, maybe they should just be happy with being kicked out instead. I am not Arab, Muslim, Palestinian or Jewish and I have many friends who are Jewish and I don't have a problem with them. But what I have a problem with is their ignorance, just like yours. You (Israelis) think you have such a great country but you COMPLETELY ignore all the horrible atrocities you have been committing. You are doing exactly what Hitler did to the Jews. You know how it felt, so why are you doing it to others? There is no excuse or justification of what you have done. And cut the bullshit that Israel lives in fear, Palestinians fight for their lives every single day.

This is the first time I'm admitting to myself that I have an eating disorder, and I've been struggling with it for three years. I hope that by finally not being in denial anymore, I can get help and get stronger. To those who think they might be developing an eating disorder, I really wish I'd admitted this a lot sooner. It's thrown me in and out of depression, and even though I technically have a healthy BMI, there's nothing healthy about the way it makes me feel. Please, don't let this be you!","#4373

So, I recently turned 20 and I've never actually been on a date or been kissed. It's really strange for me to admit it because some of my closest friends don't even know, and most days I kind of play off conversation with acquaintances as if I have. I wish I could be honest about it, but I feel like I'll be regarded as really abnormal (and I really wish I could meet a nice guy who could fulfill those two things for me).","#4371

I hate my sorority. When I first joined 2 years ago, everyone was nice and welcoming but after the 2 new pledge classes have joined, everyone is bitchy and cliquey. I feel that the sisterhood is ruined because the newer members are slutty, whiney and stupid. Even the older members have become unfriendly and cliquey so I don't know if their initial friendliness was just a show. For this reason I feel intimidated and am less active. I am also very shy in general. I feel like my shyness and quietness might make me seem hostile or bitchy but people shouldn't just assume that. Every time I pass by a sister on the streets, elevator or other public places, they smirk at me or give me a fake smile. I don't know if I personally did something to make everyone hate me or something but I definitely don't feel the ""sisterhood"" anymore. I want to drop out but my president won't let me because it will affect the budget. Every one pretends to care about chapter, ritual, philanthropy (stuff that is supposedly the basis of sisterhood) and all the other public services we do, but in reality everyone bitches about the mandatory stuff. All they care about is pretty planners and partying. I thought this would be a memorable addition to my experience at BU but it has only worsened it. I have a handful of people I am actually friends with in my sorority but I don't feel that paying such a huge amount for this experience is worth it. I don't know what to do.","#4355

Just recently, a fraternity, living at an off campus house in Allston, was robbed at gun point during one of their social events. The gunman allegedly threatened to shoot up everyone in the entire house unless someone gave him money. One brave brother stepped up and went with the culprit to walk to the closest ATM with a gun pointed at him throughout the whole time. He withdrew all of his money ($40 in cash) and handed it to the gunman. The next day, the brothers went to BUPD to file a police report. The police completely dismissed them and allegedly said, ""These things happen in Allston all the time,"" to which they proceeded to blacklist their house for throwing parties. This is very confusing because there are no reports on the newspaper or any other media about this. If this story is entirely true, I'd like to ask what the hell is wrong with you BUPD? You're more interested in shutting down a fraternity party than nabbing a psychopath (let's note that he was allegedly on Valium as well) robbing people at gun point and threatening them with mass killings? This guy can easily get nabbed because ATM machines are surrounded by cameras! Let's not forget the camera built in within the actual device. This nutcase should not be running loose for a second longer. This is beyond stupid and neglectful, it's criminal.","#4351

I want nothing to do with him, but no matter how many hints I drop, he will not leave me alone. He's ALWAYS AROUND. He stares at me. He ""accidentally"" runs into me in the dorm and dining hall so he can awkwardly say hi.

I glanced across the hallway and sure enough he was JUST STANDING THERE in the doorway looking at me for no fucking reason.

To all my fellow BU students suffering from invisible illnesses,
I know it's hard. I know sometimes you just want to fall to your knees and scream. I know sometimes you just want to escape the suffering by any means possible. But I beg you: keep moving forward. Keep pushing towards the light, even if you haven't seen it in a long time. Please don't give up. Most people cannot or do not want to see that you're suffering, and that makes it hard. But please do not give up. The world needs your ability, your kindness, your unfathomable resilience. You are stronger than you know. I am down here in the trenches with you; we are locked, arm in arm, in spirit, moving forward through the quicksand. If one falls, we all fall.
So I beg of you: if you are going through hell, keep going. And to those who are free of mental illness, try to help your neighbors out. If you see them in a down state, offer a hand in aid. They may be screaming for help inside.
To a great year,
A BU student","#4318

Within the first month of school my friends set me up with a guy and the second time we hooked up I lost my virginity. It wasn't until after that I found out a huge number of my friends were virgins. The guy stopped talking to me as well, but hey at least I got to have mediocre sex. I just want other students to know that the most important thing is to be ready and prepared and not pressured. If I had known what I do now I would've waited and done it with someone who I cared about and cared about me back.","#4261

I am really sick of professors and students forcing their extremely liberal ideas on everyone. Not everyone at BU is liberal. I come from an extremely conservative family and I do not think that it's fair that I feel like I don't have a voice here. Recently, in my sociology class, the TA brought up ""Black Lives Matter."" She stated that black lives matter is clearly a wonderful movement for african americans and all lives matter is stupid. Well guess what? Maybe I don't agree with you! I'm sure I wasn't the only one. I am open to listening to other perspectives, but when ideas are forced on me in the classroom, not only is it disrespectful but it is narrow-minded. So to all of you liberals out there who continue to force your views on others, please take a moment to remember that not everyone agrees with you. Try to be respectful.","#4257

I'm a little upset about the series on mental health that BU today is doing. I watched the first video because I was glad that they were getting the word out and attempting to lessen the stigmatization of mental illness. What I wasn't happy about is how they portrayed anxiety. Sure, you can get anxious about a test or homework or grades or anything really; that's normal. But that's not what an mental illness (like an anxiety disorder) is like. It's not stressing about one thing and then feeling relieved when it's over; it's uncontrollable worrying and stress that actually interferes with a persons ability to function on a day-to-day basis. It's the constant feeling that says something bad will happen, you'll fail, you'll fuck up, even when you're doing everything right. I'm glad they're getting the word out, but I feel like they trivialized something that I have to struggle against every single day.","#4252

I've never been good at words so I am not quite sure how to even begin this but here it goes...
At BU, and at all universities, students are in an isolated bubble and seem to forget that they are part of a larger world with more problems than assignments, your next exam, that one hot guy, that perfect girl, etc. One of the biggest issues right now is Syrian refugee crisis (you've been living under a rock if you haven't heard about it). Countries can't even seem to figure out a cohesive solution to approach the problem. Everyone is so wrapped up in themselves that no one seems to remember that these are people with basic needs. But you can help.
Kickstarter recently launched a campaign to aid the Syrian refugees through the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). They are waiving all fees (except credit card charges) so all donations go directly to the UNHCR and you will not need a Kickstarter account to help out. All your donations are 100% tax deductible and would go to help someone in need. Please consider giving at: https://www.kickstarter.com/aidrefugees
We're all busy but sometimes you need a break and others could use a break too, so if you take a minute out of your day to donate to the UNHCR or share this message, thank you.","#4246

During my freshman year, I became infatuated with a guy who treated me pretty poorly. He would make snide comments and blow me off or ignore me completely and then beg for my forgiveness. If I didn't immediately forgive him, he would call repeatedly or physically block me from leaving a room. My friends hated him and all told me to get away from him, but I told them that they were overreacting. After all, he was a normal college freshman and he'd never laid a hand on me. Then one night when he and I were watching a movie in his room, he tried to force himself on me and when I started crying, he said, ""be quiet. Someone will hear you."" When he went to the bathroom, I ran back from his dorm on west campus back to mine on east campus at 2am. After that night, I cut all ties with him. While it took until junior year for him to stop calling and randomly showing up at my door, I look back now and I'm so relieved to have him out of my life. My message is this: sometimes it's hard to see the signs of an abusive relationship when you're in it, but if your friends see something that you don't, trust them. Don't wait until the abuse escalates.","#4210

I want to open up and make a really honest (and embarrassing) confession here. So until I enlisted in the South Korean army, because it's mandatory for all Korean male citizens, I finished my third year at BU. And my GPA had always been shitty from freshman year, starting at 2.1 and declining to 1.8 during sophomore year and now it's 1.95. Technically I was supposed to get expelled from the school long ago and fortunately I took a leave of absence and right now I'm serving in the military until June 2016. As much as I despise the fact that my compulsory military service is insanely long (21 months), I cherish it because I have more than enough time to get my academic attitude back in the right place before I get back to school next year. I hope to get straight A's until I graduate in 2017 and raise my GPA to 2.5~2.6, and that's literally the highest I can raise my GPA to, unfortunately, and I hope no one derides me for this shameful truth. I want to go for the broke and get a job in the States one day, but who wants to hire a South Korean guy who graduated with a Bachelor's in Economics from a somewhat decent college with a 2.5, failed 3 classes, and has no internship and/or job experience whatsoever (I'm mustering up the energy to apply for a summer internship immediately after I get discharged from the ROK army)? Come on, who has a shittier life than this? I should just throw a grenade at myself already, now that I'm stressed out after finishing up a goddamn guerrilla warfare training that stretched my body to the highest limit.","#4206

My point is he said he really likes me and even said he's falling in love with me. But he is just not ready to be committed yet. We chatted everyday from morning to the nite and we even had sex. But I'm really confused if he really likes me why not be committed. I just want to know if this is a typical way of doing things for American guys or is he just playing me? I feel that I can't do this anymore so I have already told that if you really can't be committed now then it's better we don't contact each other again and I need to move on. And he didn't reply anymore. When I asked him this morning he said you wanna move on so that's why I didn't reply. I'm really confused about his way of action. So I just want to know if this is a cultural difference or he is just a bad guy that only wants to have sex with me or play me.","#4150

It annoys me when people don't put their silverware in the drop slots at Bay State. The other day I overheard someone say ""I pay $60,000 a year, I shouldn't have to"". You're right, you don't have to, nothings going to happen if you don't, but it's the nice, courteous and polite thing to do. Why not take a few extra seconds to make someone's life a little easier? The dining staff aren't your personal maid. It would be like a professor giving you a 10 page packet, but not stapling it all together. They don't have to, and if they didn't you would be annoyed-- but they do because it makes life easier. Return the favor, show some courtesy and separate out your silverware.","#4135

A letter to a friend
I wish you knew how much it hurts. How much it hurts to love someone and believe for a long time they feel the same way and to finally one day realize they don't and they never did. It's earth shattering. Explosive. Devastating. Because for the last seven months you lived your life in the clouds, in a state of happy oblivion. You felt pride for their successes and smiled at their joy. Their happiness was your happiness. Intimacy was a privilege. You learned their body, the way it curves when they sleep. Every imperfection was a perfection. You nestled your head into their chest every day and your bodies intertwined perfectly and it just felt safe- to be held, to be loved, to be cared about. And one day it's all gone. Distance and selfishness takes over and you're left in the dark. You sleep alone at night wondering what you did wrong. Wondering what if what if. You think you didn't love hard enough, you didn't smile big enough, you're broken. You begin to realize they never loved you in the way you did. You realize you were a security blanket. You bandaged their wounds that still have yet to heal. You made them less deep but they're still there, a reminder of their past. But while the world may seem cold and unsafe for awhile without them in yours, always remember that you're remarkable. You're strong and compassionate and caring. You radiate a special light, a passion for life and an energy that draws people in. They sucked up all they could but in the end didn't realize how amazing your energy is. How amazing you are. The beauty you hold as a person is Indescribable and those who take the time to uncover it are lucky. Soldier on because better days are coming. Better people are coming and when they do you can love them the way you loved before. It'll be tough but you must always remember there is someone out there who will love you the way you deserve to be loved --never settle for less. Please always remember to love yourself even when others don't. For the greatest person you can ever give all your love to is yourself.","#4109

A professor flat out told me he couldn't compromise on due dates to lessen mood swing severity because it would be ""showing favoritism"".

In response to the person talking about giving Melvin free Rhetty to go meals: Not saying that you shouldn't help the homeless, I volunteer at several shelters and am very personally invested in the wellbeing of bostons homeless population, but.

As a COM kid who made the decision to transfer into COM out of CAS and absolutely loves it, I get really annoyed by some of the comments I see and hear about COM kids not getting a good education or not landing a ""real"" job. Moving to COM was one of the best decisions I ever made. I love what I do, I'm getting real-world experience every day, and I'm always meeting insanely powerful and professional businessmen and women almost every week that are ready and willing to help us land jobs and internships at some of the most powerful companies in the world. Like many of you ""outsiders,"" I have also questioned why I'm not doing math or how some of these things are going to help me in the future. But I also know I would be miserable in labs or crunching numbers in an accounting book. All I ask is that you keep things in perspective. There are people like me in COM who are there not because it's ""easy"" or ""fun."" In fact, I work really hard and have found COM to be a pretty rigorous program if you're the kind of person who does anything and everything to get involved. The professional communications world is pretty cutthroat and it's great to be at a place that prepares you for it. And at the end of the day, it has been rewarding, heart-warming, and empowering. So please, next time you think about shaming COM, try to think about the kind of people here who are doing this for the same reason you're in the science lab until 3am or at Questrom in the wee hours of the morning. If you're too closed-minded, sorry to hear that, but I hope you can at least consider what it might be like to be in one of the best communications programs in the country, if that's what you're into.","#4012

As a graduating senior, I wanted to share the most important thing I've ever done at BU. When I was really struggling, I got help. Psych 101 is a requirement for a lot of people, so many of you know that the early 20s is a time when a lot of mental disorders begin to show themselves and the stress of college only exacerbates the problem. If you are struggling, or something just doesn't feel right, or your friends are concerned, or you can't bring yourself to do stuff you used to enjoy, reach out. Theres a ton of resources at BU in student health and outside of BU as well. Tell your friends. Tell your RA. Tell your professor. Tell someone. Take a semester off if you can/need it. There's nothing wrong with that. If you can't, don't let that be the reason you avoid getting help. Please know that what you're feeling is not trivial and you're not overreacting. Also know that you're not alone in this and that the lives you see through social media are edited just as much as a movie. Everyone says college is supposed to be the greatest time, but that is not true for everyone.THAT IS OKAY. I tried for a long time to just carry on, pretending like I was fine but it blew up in my face. Getting help was absolutely one of the hardest things I've ever done and the recovery process can be draining, but it is really important. You'll be amazed at how understanding a lot of people can be. I'm not saying everyone will get it, stigma is still a very real issue, but please try not to suffer in silence. I can't believe I'm graduating, I never thought I would actually be able to make it. The main reason I'm going to be able to graduate is because I got help. So please, if you're struggling and you're not sure what to do, reach out to someone, anyone. In the long run I think you'll be glad you did.","#4001

As an international student, I'm often asked if I want to stay in this country after I graduate. When I say not really, I'm often met with surprise.
Honestly, your country isn't that great, especially if I were to judge it by the ""future generation"" I see at this school. Don't get me wrong, most of my friends here are amazing Americans; they just don't see how materialistically shallow and hollow this place is though.
To all the haters, ok ok yeah I'll leave when I get my degree. Gladly so. Bye :)","#3976

Confession #3919 (the drunk, flirty girl at the party I didn't rape) deserves expansion, and I hope that everyone who took the time to read that will also take the time to read this. At least one person in the comments took the time to phrase what I meant in better words than I could, and I sincerely appreciate that.
I never at any point thought of my actions as meritorious, and responses like ""the fact that he feels as though he's owed some reward for not taking advantage of an intoxicated girl"" really shocked and confused me. If my recount of events seemed overly boastful, it was only because I was trying to make it clear that I'm outspokenly against rape culture and never had any intention of taking advantage of anyone. I really thought I had made that clear when I stated that I agreed that rape culture really is a problem.
The point of my confession wasn't to accuse anyone of anything or act like some sort of hero. I was trying to express my uncertainty after seeing her share that article, because I genuinely didn't understand and didn't know what to feel. As one person put it, it was a feeling of uncertainty because ""this girl takes a lot of action to try to end rape culture, but sometimes she acts in a way that makes her extremely vulnerable to being raped. She is far from the only girl who does this. I don't get why."" I never meant to imply anything else, and even doing this anonymously, it feels absolutely horrible to be typecast as some walking testament to rape culture's proliferation just because I broached the subject.","#3959

In response to the post on the Indian kid feeling nervous about perpetuating stereotypes: I know what you mean. I feel like I have to put in extra effort to be clean, well-dressed, and carry myself well because I don't want to perpetuate any of the ""Indians are dirty/poor/trashy"" stereotypes. No one realizes how a country of 1.23 billion people is going to produce an immensely wide spectrum of people. It also bothers me when my friends make fun of the ""Indian"" accent (there are multiple accents all across India and not a single white person can get any of them right) and dance weirdly by shaking their heads and giggle about it. I understand cracking jokes about stereotypes - hell, in India, there are people that mock the American accent and the obesity problems in this country, etc. - but I think that they cross the line into offensive. Don't get me wrong, they're great people and I am glad I met them, but I wish people in this country were more accepting of foreign cultures than weirded out by things they don't understand. I have a feeling that this post will get attacked as well by people that don't realize that they are being offensive when they are. I wish I could talk about how awesome India is and how warm our people really are. But I suppose I would end up talking at uninterested walls.

Don't get me wrong, they're great people and I am glad I met them, but I wish people in this country were more accepting of foreign cultures than weirded out by things they don't understand. I have a feeling that this post will get attacked as well by people that don't realize that they are being offensive when they are. I wish I could talk about how awesome India is and how warm our people really are. But I suppose I would end up talking at uninterested walls.

Dear beautiful people,
I was walking towards Myles the other day. It was a Friday night, I think. I wasn't in a great mood. At the corner of SMG and COM ave. a girl and her friend were laughing hysterically. One was seated at the round benches and the other was prancing around in the bike land of COM ave., hoping to hail a taxi. It was clear that they were intoxicated, which is fine, do you I guess.
But as I passed and continued walking towards the entrance of SMG, things got a little messy. The girl sitting on the bench got up and joined her friend in the street in her attempt to call a cab. The traffic light turned red and so a black car had stopped for it. The girls were so drunk they thought that this was a taxi. They even tried opening the car doors to get inside when it was really a random guy just trying to get home from work.
They stumbled around on each other, laughing at the situation. The light turned green and the car sped off but the girls didn't move from the street. They continued standing there laughing in the middle of traffic. Luckily, there weren't a lot of cars and the cars that did see them managed to slow down in time, albeit, to a screeching halt, blasting their horns and almost causing a tragic scene.
I wasn't the only one noticing this. I had tried yelling at them to get out of the street. Two guys came up and brought them to the side of the road. One guy hailed a cab and made sure they got in ok.
So main thing here folks:
1. Do not be an idiot. You gonna drink? Awesome. You gonna have fun? Great! Please do not wander into traffic and put yourself and other people in danger. Multiple lives could have been ruined. Control your liquor. Mkay?
Thanks,
A concerned 21 year old who is graduating and is concerned for the wellbeing of a lot of people.","#3905

Sexual misconduct is very real. Recent events have highlighted sexual misconduct that has occurred among students, but BU has done a good job of hiding sexual misconduct committed by its OWN faculty. I am one of many young women who have been harassed by a professor here. It's been over a year since I have started this long judicial process, and nothing came out of the process. But the one thing that defined my experience with the administration was when one of the administrators insinuated that somewhere in this process, I was at fault for not getting the outcome I found necessary or appropriate. I did all that I could do. I filed a complaint, I visited your offices, I wrote emails, I called your administration, I went to meetings. I met with the US Office of Civil Rights. Instead, BU let this disgusting excuse of a man keep his tenure here, and he will prey on young women. I am another woman who has been abandoned by the institution that was supposed to protect me. I am another woman who asked for justice, but was victimized again. First by a member of the faculty, and then a second time, by the administration. Like the young woman who wrote an anonymous open letter last week, I am not the first, and I will not be the last if this administration does nothing with the cases it is given. Sexual harassment happens, and it happens at BU.

He has a right to make art. He has a right to be proud, and to be angry, and anything else he feels right now. That being said, I found his photo disturbing. It was of a little girl smiling, with her middle finger raised, standing proudly next to a cop car.
All I could think about is how many other little kids are being taught to hate or disrespect or fear the police. If all police are ""bad"", who will be the good in this world? Who will serve and protect this little girl, then? If she ever finds herself in a dangerous situation one day, who will she call for help and justice? I can't even begin to tell you what is wrong in our country or how to fix it, but I know in my heart that teaching our children these kinds of values, or lack thereof, is only going to expand and prolong the problem.","#3869

Whether or not this school has or doesn't have grade deflation is trivial. In my opinion, it's quite honestly bullshit, because if you do some research you'll see that it's actually risen from 2.9 in the 1980s to 3.0 now (at least for CAS). I'll concede the point though that other schools have obvious grade inflation (Harvard, Georgetown, etc.) Do you honestly think our grads are having a hard time because of their sub-par grades compared to our competitors in the job market? Unless you do really badly and manage to get significantly below a 3.0, I hardly think grades matter most to employers. Experience probably means a lot more to employers, so go out and find an internship at a company. Take advantage of the opportunities that BU provides you with to help get an internship at company X/Y/Z, isn't that why you're paying a horribly overpriced education? Ultimately, if you're really worried about your job prospects after graduation either get off your ass and find an internship/research position or work harder on your grades, because whining about it isn't going to do anything.","#3850

What happened to overcoming obstacles no matter how difficult the challenge? What happened to the idea of wanting to build great things and wanting to make humanity better? It seems that I'm just surrounded by a majority of people who just want to be comfortable out of fear for failure.

During freshman year in warren, I got talked into by some floor mates to smoke a bowl in the shower room. At first I was skeptical but one of my floor-mates insisted he did it before last year 'all the time'. Since I was skeptical I brought some duct tape and proceeded to seal the vent that led to the common room and door gap of the shower room. I then began to burn with my bros using the bowl that my RA had lended me a couple nights prior so I could burn with my floor-mates. I had broken mine (I'll never forget when he gave me the bowl which was inside a Milano's cookie container at the time while gathered in a room with floor-mates singing eagle eye cherry's ""Save Tonight"").
Long story short I ended up leaving the room baked after a long smoke session and I found out while in there my RA and another RA had done their floor check while I was in there, and could smell weed but somehow my RA talked the other RA out of further investigating.
TLDR My RA gave me a bowl which I used to hotbox a shower-room, and he saved my ass from getting caught. Most awesome RA and an act of kindness that I'll never forget.","#3753

Don't know if you're going to read this, but whatever.
I was having a shitty day. Not terribly so... just that dull, low-grade shittiness born from anxiety and stress. Since I was over there anyway, I retreated to the street piano in the GSU. Tried to calm myself down with Claire de Lune. I became aware of you, just in the corner of my vision, as I was finishing up. Great, I thought. I've probably been keeping him from his own turn. I rose and turned away from the piano, wanting to just be out of there, but you stopped me and told me how beautiful the piece was, and why you stopped to listen, and a few other comforting words.
My confession is that I acknowledged you with thanks little more than cursory, and rushed away when I got the chance. In truth, that one little act of kindness from you, a complete and total stranger, pulled me out from my own personal level of hell. I'm sorry.

Don't know if you're going to read this, but whatever.
I was having a shitty day. Not terribly so... just that dull, low-grade shittiness born from anxiety and stress. Since I was over there anyway, I retreated to the street piano in the GSU. Tried to calm myself down with Claire de Lune. I became aware of you, just in the corner of my vision, as I was finishing up. Great, I thought. I've probably been keeping him from his own turn.

I walk down Comm Ave every day witnessing the happiness of hundreds of couples in Boston, BU and non-BU. If I could give all of those couples I pass by advice, it would be to NEVER neglect your significant other. Text them goodnight. Meet for breakfast before your day starts to have a smile in the morning. Give them a phone call. Show up at their door unexpectedly. Bring them flowers, or a smoothie, or a novel, or whatever they're into. You may just be """"dating"""" someone in college, but that someone is still a special individual who cares deeply about you. While you are out ignoring them for no reason, they are waiting by their phone wondering if everything is okay. Don't assume that spontaneous """"I love you's"""" that you say halfheartedly can heal a broken heart.
Never take any person for granted. No one deserves that.","#3716

You know how people say ""sick with worry"" ? Well that's me, I actually get cold/flu symptoms from worrying about practically everything. I don't know how this happened. I was so effervescently happy last year, and I have happy days still but they're marred by memories, good and bad.

College was not what I thought it was going to be. My problems didn't go away, my life didn't change drastically. I didn't have any revelations about what I wanted to do in life. No epiphany about myself or my role in the world. I don't know if it's college, maybe it's just me. There are days where I don't want to do anything. It's not just laziness. I just don't want to be awake. If I'm awake, I'm thinking. And sometimes that is the worse thing that can happen.
I look at my past and wonder what I've accomplished in life. All my regrets and mistakes crowd out the happy memories. And the happy memories only bring sadness. I'll see an old picture and wonder ""Where did it all go wrong? How did my family end up like this? How did I end up like this?"" Sometimes I just lie in bed unable to sleep, the past rising in my memories and bashing me in the face. In fact that's how I ended up here.
I look at my present, at what I'm doing. I can't find a reason for it, except so that I can escape. Escape from reality through sports, exercise, a good story. I do it because I have to do it, because it's what I have left. Homework, projects, studying.
But then I look at the future and everything now seems so pointless. It's not that I look at the future and see darkness and whatever. It's that I look at the future and see nothing but white. Everything is just blank and it won't let you forget it. It's like a high powered flashlight being aimed at your face while you're trying to sleep.
And then sometimes I wonder if this is just a phase. If this will all just pass. If I have the right to be feeling so doom and gloom. I'm sure there are plenty of people in this world worse off than me. But I'm selfish and when something bad happens to me, the world is ending even if the sun shines bright and promises to rise another day. I feel guilty that I feel this way and even a little guilty for writing this. It just ends up sounding like a cry for attention, a rant or a complaint.
Anyway, what's done is done. Thank you BU confessions for letting me burden the rest of the world with my fog.","#3688

I introduce one of my good friends to my roommate during the first week of previous semester, and the first thing that my roommate says when he meets my friend for the first time is, ""I swallowed my own cum a few weeks ago."" What's worse is that my friend thinks he's just being honest. I can't believe that I've been rooming with the same roommate for 8 months. Fuck my life. Actually no. School is about to end soon.","#3682

A tour group is a multi-cellular blob. A collective that is bonded tightly together by prospective students and their naive parents. They are a conformative blob that tends to obstruct high trafficking areas where actual students have places to go to instead of being blocked. It's not even possible to squeeze through the blob unless you undergo a process of endocytosis and then exocytosis (if you're lucky). And worst of all, it's a nightmare to be consumed into the blob's observational amusement. The blob's method of locomotion is made of numerous bi-pedal propectives but lack the agile mobility of a singular entity. Even after taking numerous detours to get to where I need to be, they always find me. There is no escaping the blob. Even though the blobs are slow-learners, I find the words ""move b**** get out the way"" to be a very effective method.

At first I wasn't sure whether I should post this or not. After all, I cannot claim that I was Kevin's best friend, nor am I part of his family. But I was, and still am his friend on whom he made an impact. The nature of time is to fade and forget, but alas it is bittersweet because it also cannot discern between memories of joy or pain, good or bad. In this regard, I want to immortalize Kevin in the best way I can- with my words.
Some people may not have known Kevin. In fact, I know for a fact that many people did not. Whoever you are, whether you knew him or not, doesn't matter to me; I only hope you can find significance in Kevin through my words so he may be more than just a name or a victim of tragedy.
In short, Kevin was a gentle soul. Everything about him was delicate: he was pale, soft-spoken, kind, and didn't like to be assertive. He liked to use a British accent that no one probed him about. He was extremely intelligent, but in a humble and understated manner. He had his own way of shuffling that I could recognize without even seeing his face. Not one comfortable with showing unbridled emotion, he'd sometimes stifle a smile or laugh but the beauty was in knowing that all of his expressions were undoubtedly genuine.
At first, he seemed almost reluctant to admit that he was part of our group, as if he'd convinced himself there was no way he could be included. He enjoyed the newfound attention but didn't quite know how to respond at times, making him a quirky and slightly awkward guy. But it was all part of his charm. He was naive, pure, and kind- somehow seemed untainted by the underside of society.
Fascinating. Once he began to open up in his own way, this is the probably the sole word that can accurately describe his mind. Kevin was an extremely private individual, and while we knew basic details of his past and his reason for transferring to BU, disclosure was something he didn't do. Besides the time he spent with us at Warren for dinner (he lived in Towers), or visited us briefly late at night on his way back from studying, his private life was just that: private. He spent much of his time alone, but we respected that. Kevin was Kevin. Despite this, he was very curious about our own lives. Enthusiastic, even. When he became more comfortable with us, he frequently asked detailed questions and showed genuine interest in what we had to say about ourselves. It was initially such a contrast from what we thought he was like, but it was his way of expressing that he cared.
Kevin is dead. There are too many euphemisms to soften the blow of reality when it comes to death; whether someone is passed, moved on, in heaven, deceased, or departed, nothing changes that they are no longer alive. Kevin will never again hurry to class, watch tv with his sister, regret not putting on a jacket because it's cold outside, spill water on his sleeve, or stand in line in the dining hall. He will never graduate, get married, or have kids. He will never know the rush of joy and anticipation from landing his first internship, and he will never buy his first car. But you and I still can.
I want to celebrate Kevin's life without being obstructed by death. There is nothing anyone can do to bring him back, and the best thing we can do for him now is to remember him, and learn from him. Let's not hold back anymore. Let's live life to its fullest, while realizing that also means embracing both the ups and downs. The human experience is inherently imperfect- hence 'human"""". If you're happy, cherish it. If you're sad, tell someone. If you need help, seek it out. We all have the same capacity to be happy, it's just easier to remember on some days than on others.
Kevin, you were a great guy. I still can't believe you're gone. I will never forget hearing you laugh unrestrained for the first time, or your shy smile or the lengthy, hushed conversation about the existence of ghosts we had with Julia and Tommy at 1 am on the cold floor right outside my Warren dorm room. I know you're in a better place and I hope our words and thoughts reach you, wherever you are.I am thankful and honored to have met you.
Lastly, this is not a goodbye.
I'll see you later, Kevin.
Rest in peace.","#3661

Last semester I got into a relationship with a girl who I thought was perfect. She was pretty, straight from boarding school and seemed like a feminine bro to me. Little did I know that she would temporarily destroy my entire life. Although we slept together all semester, she was a formerly suicidal girl with mental problems all which came out only after a month. I tried to help her out, treated her like a lady in a chivalrous European manner that I was raised in. She ended up hitting me, swearing at me, we ended up making up and breaking up many times during the semester for no real reason and she would then cry on my shoulder about her depression and possible bipolar disorder. But I still loved her. She ended up dumping me Christmas break a day before I was supposed to visit her family. Now I am on a leave of absence, I am the one diagnosed as bipolar suddenly and my social and academic life were ruined. She on the other hand is back at BU, joined a sorority, parties every weekend, and has more friends than ever, all while I sit alone in pain. I hope you live with your guilt.","#3656

Although I had to give up some of the things I really love to do, I was fortunate enough to be able to come back to school. No one here besides my doctors knows what I am currently going through. I thought that finishing the semester would be a nightmare. But it has been the exact opposite.

I am so incredibly thankful for what I have here at BU. It truly is an amazing university, and the faculty and staff actually care.

Saturday night, one of my best friends got way too hammered at an apartment in South. He's a little on the husky side, weighing in at a healthy 300+lbs, so simply dragging his ass back to Stuvi was a fucking force. It was just our luck that a moving cart with a staggering 3 out of 4 wheels was blessedly parked outside the apartment. Without hesitation, me and three of my boys rolled him into the cart and pushed him across the bridge all the way to Stuvi. Although he was sore as fuck the next morning, it was and will be the most glorious crawl back home anyone's ever experienced.

I'm heartbroken from seeing so many people post about feelings of depression and thoughts of suicide that have gone upon deaf ears at SHS and in the community. For anyone that thinks they are alone, I hope you know that while it feels that way, over 30% of college students at one point have felt """"so depressed that it was difficult to function"""". You are not alone, not even a little bit. 3 out of 10 people on Comm Ave, in your classes, at the gym know where you've been, how low and horrible it's felt. It is negligent for SHS to not put the safety and well-being of students first, and it needs to be fixed- NOW, because YOU are most important, and that's it.

Was partaking in my usual 26th floor stuvi2 studies when I decided to call it a night. I get on the elevator and press the button for the 12th floor where my suite is located. As the elevator starts doing it's thing I pull out my phone and do my casual tinder swipes to waste some time. As the elevator then stops I am frazzled by this girl I have never seen on my floor before. I give her a strange look as I walk out, as she was gorgeous and my floor contains very little of such fine aesthetically pleasing women. I carry on, and again, my attention goes straight to my tinder machine as I walk to the suite. I open the door of the suite, go inside, then open the bedroom door to see a girl who had just gotten out of the shower and was in her towel. I immediately freeze thinking what the fuckkk happened to my room and why is this chic in it. Then it all comes back to me. This isn't my floor, this is the girl's floor who got on the elevator before me (16). I then proceed to shut the door quickly-yell through the door how sorry I am, and how it was all a mistake. You could probably guess from there that I didn't get this girl's number and yes, I have seen her in the dining hall every day since.","#3607

She proceeded to tell us that we should never do something like that, and that we should always reach out to someone who might be in need. Thing is, I was just thinking the day before about how much I'd like to just end it. I have a feeling that no one in that class would notice if I just stopped showing up one day. Most of the university, and the world for that matter, would go on unaffected. I don't think I could ever actually kill myself, but I don't feel very intrinsically motivated to keep going.

The other day, I saw a squirrel digging a hole into the ground. He was digging but it was more like full on propulsions of its fuzzy muscles. He was jackhammering an acorn into his dirt crater. It wasn't like he was nestled away or hidden by a tree or bush. He was literally out in the middle of this wide open green area in front of CAS. I think he knew people were looking at him too. He wasn’t stupid.
I wasn’t the only one to notice this squirrel. The sidewalk was filled with people that day. It was top of the hour, middle of the day. I saw people slow down their walking to look at this squirrel. He would even stop occasionally to look up and around. It looked like he was trying to catch his breath, thinking about where the nearest puddle of water was.
But it was also like he was looking at the people. I couldn't tell if he wasn't giving any french fries about what people thought or if he was waiting for the lactic acid to build back up for further digging. But he made eye contact either way. Then he would just get back to it with so much energy. If squirrels could sweat, this guy was dripping. I’d like to think that squirrels have friends, but where were his? Were they off working as hard as this guy? He needed a pay raise, an increase in his acorn ration, the softer burrow, something.
I know some people who work as hard as that squirrel and it may seem like no one notices or cares. But as people have admired that squirrel, people will admire you.","#3597

So I was trying to get into 100 Baystate, but I didn't have my ID, so I called my roommate to swipe me into the dining hall. When she arrived downstairs the lady checking to make sure that people swiped in correctly was not in sight, so I decided to leap over the gates to obtain the carnitas that my inner Hispanic desired. The moment I jumped the barrier between me and my porky goodness, the Asian woman checking the gates came back and started to run at me. I decided to do what any decent individual would do....book it. I ran with my roommate up the stairs and around the corner. The Asian lady grabbed a manager and started running after me and my roommate. Luckily we turned a corner and lost them for a little bit. I hid in a corner, sitting at a table with one of my friends. I feared for my life and knew that imminent doom was slowly looming over me. After around 10 minutes of hiding the Asian lady and the manager stood directly in front of our table. My friend tried to look confused, as if he didn't understand what was going on, while I pretended to look very upset and hide my face. The manager finally asked ""Is everything alright here?"" And my friend played it cool saying that I was just very upset. Unfortunately the damn Asian Lady noticed an article of clothing that I had and pointed me out to the manager. The manager then told me to follow him. He brought me downstairs and lectured me about what I did. I ended up getting a guest meal from my friend, and snarffing down a sub-par carnita that left me feeling empty inside. I can now never show my face at Marciano Commons again because I will forever be known as that girl that ran past security for a shitty carnita.","#3592

I was in the dining hall today when I overheard a girl at the table next to mine telling her friend about her hookup story from the night before. Apparently she had hooked up with some dude without telling him that she was on her period because she figured the lights were gonna be off the whole night anyway. She left the morning after while he was still asleep but was able to get a good look at his sheets which looked ""like a crime scene"". She also made it a point to not give him her number so they could never see each other again. Stay classy, BU","#3584

Junior year I went to a party at Stuvi that was supposed to be the biggest dorm party in BU history. It was for my roommate's friend's 21st birthday, and it was in the top floor in a large suite. Somehow the douchers that threw the party were able to sneak in a couple kegs, and for some reason assumed that people drink Mike's Hard (lol, not frat).
It was a total sausage fest, and at one point, the RAs came, and the two guys that threw the rager actually cried and gave them 100$ in order for them to not bust us.
Anyways, I had one of the worst shits of my life at that party, and there was no toilet paper in the suite. I wiped all of the wet shit out of my ass with two of the towels hanging in the bathroom.
But, that's not my confession. I just wanted to confess that I secretly have become addicted to chewing tobacco, and I trained myself to swallow my dip spit while I was home on break so my parents couldn't tell that I was packing lip in front of them.","#3575

Junior year, my buddy was turning 21 so I knew I had to do something big, as someone who lives in campus, I set out to throw the Project X of dormitory ragers. I rented the yellow bins to ""move things"" into my room but little did housing know it was the ultimate scheme for transporting 2 kegs, a case of wine coolers, and all the mikes hard one's heart could desire into the heavily guarded fortress known as Stuvi2. Once I breezed past the naive guard who looks like Raekwon of Wu-Tang with my yellow bin I knew I was fucking coasting. I emptied my bin, and turned it back into housing then took the vator back upto my room to start hanging the decos. It was a surprise party so we kept my bro out of the apartment all day with the help of his gf who lived on our floor (can someone say floorcest..um yea). Come like 10pm, I got like everyone I knew and their mother in Stuvi2 to sign in all my guests it was pretty sick, I tried keeping it mad exclusive. Signed in only, so I didn't have any fucking losers up in my suite. Now mind you I have like 50-60 kids in my Stuvi2 apartment, which is basically a penthouse with the skyline of Boston at our backs so we were fucking balling. But to our dismay the fun police aka ""RAs on call"" came knocking on our door. By the grace of God I was able to hide everyone in each individual bedroom, and they went away, raging commenced. Come 12 its my boys ""Big 21"" so we decide to get fucking midget strippers as a surprise. The look on Raekwon's face when I signed in 2 midgets dressed as police officers was fucking legendary. Once we got to the room they did there thing and everyone was loving it. Party ended at 2 cause it was study week and I needed my guests out by then, but it was probably the sickest/ most EPIC dorm party of all time. I threw the Project X of Dorm parties in Stuvi2, and we balled out like players, fuck all the kids in frats and who live off campus who think they're shits better.

Dearest BU,
I pay an arm and a leg a year for you to provide me with an dingy, caving-in, rat-infested apartment and facilities that should hopefully live up to the ridiculously priced standards.
However, you have upset me yet again with your laundry facilities.
My roommate and I have started keeping tabs on which laundry machines do not work.
Washers flood (anyone else experienced the small lake in the bottom?) or don't work (aka stuff is DRY when the load is done-but maybe with a little detergent on top).
Dryers DON'T EVER ACTUALLY DRY.
Wait, but actually, why do we even pay $1.50 for a cycle that doesn't dry? So we ALWAYS have to add the extra 25cent cycles and even THOSE don't always work. Put it on high heat and it STILL won't work. I know for a damn fact that I did NOT put that much laundry in the machine that my clothes should come out AS WET AS THEY WERE WHEN I FIRST TOOK THEM OUT OF THE WASH.
Thanks for the shitty laundry stuff, BU.
Sincerely,
Person With Full Load of Laundry Hanging to Dry All Over Apartment

(This is long but it's about sex and I think someone needs to say it). I am a freshman and I was in a relationship for the majority of high school. I thought it was strange how people can comfortably hook up with multiple people without having feelings for them or without developing any soon after. Coming to college single, I thought I wouldn't be like the others that hooked up with a different person every weekend, and most definitely not more than one person per weekend. But boy, did my view change. I've always been very sexual, just with the same person. Being single in a new environment with new people didn't change that, in fact it heightened it. Maybe as a high schooler it would have been bad to be ""easy"" or hook up a lot. But as a college student I think who cares? As long as you're comfortable with what you're doing, AND BEING SAFE, go ahead and do it. I will admit (even though anonymously) that I REALLY like sex. It's great because it comes with multiple benefits which include but are not limited to: curing headaches and stomachaches, a workout, clearing your sinus, and having a connection (emotional, physical, spiritual - for some - fun, etc) with someone that you may not ever see again (but it's still an experience), a friend (and this can improve your friendship - or ruin it so do be careful), someone that soon becomes more than just a fuckbud or a one night thing, or whoever you choose. It's also great for your self-esteem because you feel wanted, you know you're wanted - this is of course if you don't expect your partner to fall in love with you and you don't want more than what he does, and you grow comfortable with your body and sexuality. I know I'm not drop dead gorgeous, but I've been told I'm attractive and for a while I didn't believe it until now, I like my body. The best part is that you and I are not the only ones that feel this way - there are thousands of others here that have the exact same view point regarding sexual relations.
I like sex because of the reasons above (gets rid of headaches, my friendships improve, I have a fun night, I feel wanted, and most importantly it just feels GOOD) and my partner understands NSA so no one gets hurt because we recognize there is no commitment involved.
Disregarding all stereotypical ""negative"" consequences for exhibiting interest in sexual relations (like rape or losing a friend) I am in control of every situation because I do what I want with who I want and have been lucky so far with having fun and safe experiences each time. For me personally, the reason for having sex with someone should be yours to make. I think sex is an important stepping stone in a growing relationship with someone you really care about, I do. But at other times I will have sex with someone because they're nice and funny and we can have a good time without getting hurt. Assuming he won't rape me, I have the power to say no and end things when I so choose. I know what I'm doing and I'm having fun with my life how I choose to.
So basically, thank you college and the students here for understanding that I just really like sex. And if you think I'm a slut, idgaf that this is what you think, I'm still going to do me and have all the sex I want for my own reasons. And no, I will not just have sex with ANYONE because I'm NOT easy, there is a HUGE difference. But if you're nice, fun, funny, can hold a convo and understand what NO means, go for it, you'll never know what will happen if you don't try ;)","#3525
(This is long but it's about sex and I think someone needs to say it). I am a freshman and I was in a relationship for the majority of high school. I thought it was strange how people can comfortably hook up with multiple people without having feelings for them or without developing any soon after. Coming to college single, I thought I wouldn't be like the others that hooked up with a different person every weekend, and most definitely not more than one person per weekend. But boy, did my view change. I've always been very sexual, just with the same person. Being single in a new environment with new people didn't change that, in fact it heightened it. Maybe as a high schooler it would have been bad to be ""easy"" or hook up a lot. But as a college student I think who cares? As long as you're comfortable with what you're doing, AND BEING SAFE, go ahead and do it. I will admit (even though anonymously) that I REALLY like sex. It's great because it comes with multiple benefits which include but are not limited to: curing headaches and stomachaches, a workout, clearing your sinus, and having a connection (emotional, physical, spiritual - for some - fun, etc) with someone that you may not ever see again (but it's still an experience), a friend (and this can improve your friendship - or ruin it so do be careful), someone that soon becomes more than just a fuckbud or a one night thing, or whoever you choose.

If you got something to say about smoking then just say it to my face instead of being a pussy and writing an anonymous letter to the masses. Idc who you know that died from smoking, Idc about your personal grievances against smoking. Idc about your medical condition. Not because these things don't matter, nor do I want to cause you harm and bring up bad memories (god forbid you find out that I too had family members that died from smoking cuz then your head would spin out of control in a violent explosion of disillusionment when you realize you're not the only one who has had hard times). It's just that I hold on to this thing called free will. You are entitled to your own opinion and I will respect that, just as I would expect you to respect my own opinion and my own choices.

If you got something to say about smoking then just say it to my face instead of being a pussy and writing an anonymous letter to the masses. Idc who you know that died from smoking, Idc about your personal grievances against smoking. Idc about your medical condition. Not because these things don't matter, nor do I want to cause you harm and bring up bad memories (god forbid you find out that I too had family members that died from smoking cuz then your head would spin out of control in a violent explosion of disillusionment when you realize you're not the only one who has had hard times). It's just that I hold on to this thing called free will. You are entitled to your own opinion and I will respect that, just as I would expect you to respect my own opinion and my own choices.

Now, second hand smoking....are you kidding me? you actually think that 2 seconds of accidentally breathing/smelling our cigarette smoke is going to give you cancer?!!! You all live in a city. There is going to be pollution. Some of you drink copious amounts of alcohol, that is as harmful as smoking cigarettes. So get over yourselves or walk around us if you don't want to smell our cigarettes. Don't inhale for 2 seconds if you're THAT worried about it harming you. There are going to be worse things in life than that. So, peace, love, harmony, and everyone chill the fuck out.","#3482

I smoke weed here and there, but I'm not that big on it. I also like to think I'm a very friendly and social person; I have no problem talking to strangers and making new friends. I'm also a relationship kind of girl. Yes, on the boyfriend/girlfriend level but I also mean making connections. The only two people I've really felt like I've made connections with happen to be guys that smoke a lot of weed. One is not my year but we hit it off right away and talked and hung out a lot. It was often pretty flirty But now he has a gf. Another guy is my age but doesn't go here, also a pretty big stoner. I'm not on a hunt for a relationship and I wouldn't shut down an opportunity for one. I'm kind of confused though why the only two guys I've really connected with are stoners. I'm not saying I wouldn't date one, just curious. Is it because they're laid back and think about things in a different light than most BU students? I thought that's how these two guys were at least. I guess I have a connection with guys that smoke a lot. I kind of want to test this theory? Any stoners want to have a chill sesh and talk about life?","#3460

I'm not on a hunt for a relationship and I wouldn't shut down an opportunity for one. I'm kind of confused though why the only two guys I've really connected with are stoners. I'm not saying I wouldn't date one, just curious. Is it because they're laid back and think about things in a different light than most BU students? I thought that's how these two guys were at least. I guess I have a connection with guys that smoke a lot. I kind of want to test this theory? Any stoners want to have a chill sesh and talk about life?",,1393014611,,,17,5,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=622623341136894&id=455239657875264,

Homophobic people make me so frustrated. It doesn't matter how you grew up, don't use religion or anything else as an excuse to promote your prejudice. There are a million quotes in the bible about love and against judgement, but there's one that can be interpreted in an anti-gay way and everyone decides to take it literally? Despite the fact that numerous other notions in the bible are out dated and go unsubscribed to by the majority of religious people?
And even if you're not out right homophobic, just try and be mindful that anyone around you could be gay. I just hate that there's a group of people who might feel like they have to hide or feel uncomfortable with being who they are. People can be fired from their jobs for being gay in some states..like that's so crazy to me. In most states two gay people who love each other can't get married.. Like what??? It's literally 2014.
I don't get what the big deal is. Love is love. For all my fellow LGBTQ etc out there, just know that I love you and hopefully one day everyone will get their heads out of their asses and realize things aren't so black and white.","#3457

So the other day, I left my mac charger in a classroom in CGS. Doesn't sound like a huge deal, right? Problem was, this was after a 6-9 class and I didn't realize I had done it until I got home. I also live really far from campus and commute in every day, so I just really couldn't turn around and go back. I figured it would be gone when I showed up to campus the next day. I mean, it's a mac charger, and that's just the connotation with anything Apple I suppose. But BOOM. It was right there. In all it's glory. So I just wanted to say thanks to everybody who saw it, and left it exactly where it was (a very tauntingly obvious plug at the front of a classroom). You saved me a crap load of money on a new charger, and put a smile on both of my parents' faces (which makes having to live at home in college A LOT easier). So, yea. Thanks BU.","#3441

Ten percent of us have depression. But we don't know who does or doesn't have it. The girl who purges herself everyday after lunch while she cries, might be the one who is the envy of the class. Or maybe the star-athlete of the school cuts himself everyday because he can't stand living. No one is impervious to it. But if you are part of that ten percent, know that you are stronger than others to have made it this far and that it's possible to get better with therapy and medication.
You shouldn't have to suffer because you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, yes that's right, a chemical imbalance. You friend might have diabetes, an imbalance of glucose. He has a disease just like how we have a disease. But like many diseases it's treatable. At the same time, it can also lead to death. Our society has a terrible stigma about depression. They view it as weak and needy, when the reality is, we are emotionally stronger than many of our peers. Do you know what we end up doing? We drink to numb the pain away. We get high to feel happiness. And when we can't find drugs in the house? We cut. Both boys and girls alike.
The ones who """"care"""" for us will tell us to stop. They see our destructive actions as the problem. As long as they can't see our scars, everything is okay to them. At the same time, their actions may seem insensitive towards your feelings. It's not their fault either. They care, but they don't understand depression enough because they're taught its a weakness. """"Cut it out,"""" they say, """"There are people worse off than you."""" We are not weak. We are not fragile. We are in a war against our mind, and we are hardened soldiers.
Depression is a dark cloud that obscures your vision on life. It makes everything seem like it's ten times worse. You can't think straight, you're tired, you're slow, you don't eat, don't sleep, you get sick all the time. But the beautiful thing is that we can get better. We can learn to cope with difficult situations. We can succeed to see life as something beautiful. And also, taking anti-depressants doesn't make you weak. That's like telling your friend with high-blood pressure to stop taking his medication. Oh, just snap out of it!
If there's one thing you should take away from this: If you need help, it's okay. It's okay to tell your doctor. He/she won't judge. It's okay to ask a school psych for help. There isn't anything they haven't seen. They're not going to tell your parents. Don't worry. We have a disease. This doesn't mean we can flaunt it, and make people pity us. We have something just as life threatening as many other conditions. Depression isn't something I would wish on my worst enemy. But if anything, stay strong soldier, because you're not alone. You have an entire army backing you up.","#3437

So I live in a suite full of fraternity ""bros"" in Stuvi 2, and these kids are out of their fucking minds, just humor me here. One is super Asian, he chain smokes like a fiend, rides a crotchrocket, and has a super feisty sorority girl Asian girlfriend who he fights with on almost daily basis. You've never seen anger util you've heard a screaming match in Korean, let me tell ya. In the next room we have another degenerative cigarette fiend. The kids supposed to be an engineer, but I never see him doing any work. Between playing Fifa with one of his other ""bros"" and constantly smoking in the showers he's logging in a full day at the office. Homework fuck it, lets see who runs up the tallies on the whiteboard before I go to bed, and try to booty call some sorority bimbo.The next guy usually pretty quiet, and he has a girlfriend so he keeps to himself. Just a die hard masshole sports fan who loves 3 things his frat, his bros, and everything Boston. Honestly if Boston was a woman he'd fuck the shit out of her using papa ginos marinara as lube. Next guy further down the hall is yet again another degenerate. Motherfucker smokes like a chimney and fucks anything with a pussy and a pulse. This bastard can be seen playing fifa with the for mentioned ""bro"" referred to early. Always rocking pastels and different colored vest, whatever he's feeling that day that fucking hardo. Then theres the classic frat guido, this kid cares about 4 things his hair, his muscles, his schoolwork, and thinking about pussy. This kid takes more morning supplements than an 80 year old woman with thyroid and gastrointestinal problems. And for what? He hasn't seen a pussy since the one he came out of back in '93. Although he did manage to scrape the bottom of the barrel and fuck a swamp creature the other night, but like I said its been a while since then. So as you can see being a GDI in this atmosphere is a struggle, someone save me from this fratopia I call a Stuvi 2 dorm room.","#3415

So last semester I met this guy on my first day of class. He was nothing too special to me at first glance, but soon we became close friends. About a month after being friends I realized that I kind of liked him, but then soon found out he had a girlfriend that didn't go here but to a school nearby. I’m not the kind of person to get in between two people in a relationship so I put my feelings aside and we became even closer. No flirting, just really close friends. After a while he and his gf broke up and I panicked. I panicked because I wasn’t ready to tell him how I felt and I knew some girl would show interest in him soon. In the last few weeks he has been forgetful, partying all the time, smoking a lot, and generally a different person than last semester. Last semester he was a funny, witty, and caring man, now he’s acting like a reckless boy. Now I understand that he could be going through something, but I have no idea who this person is. To make matters worse, I think another girl is showing interest in him and vice versa and I feel like I lost my chance. If anyone has ever felt replaced you know what I am feeling. I care about him and want to be there for him, but I don’t want to push him. I’m working getting space between us (which is impossibly hard) and spending time with my friends/focusing on my schoolwork to see if it will help. Should I tell him? I don’t want to ruin our friendship.","#3411

Sometimes I think about dying. Heavy as it might be, it always seems so relevant to me... because then I get thinking about living. Really living. It's beautiful because it is the simplest little idea and I feel like it could bring everyone together.. if we just stopped to consider it more. Any religion, gender, age, ethnicity, or socio-economic class has to agree: we have no fucking idea how long we've got left. Terrifyingly beautiful. We can continue to ignore it because it is heavy and uncomfortable; we can continue to invest in made up ideas like security and guarantees because they're cozy.. but I think there might be more. Life is waiting for you to take it people, I swear it. Go talk to that girl, go on that trip, give that locked up feeling crush you like a wave, give your dad a call, run as fast as you can for no good reason, jump. Every second we get a brand new chance to defy death and redefine life. Imagining every human be as human as they can possibly be together -- even for 5 minutes -- overwhelms my senses so much I want to collapse with total serenity. I'm so excited because I'm dying; I'm so excited because before I'm dead, I promise to be alive. Rest assured, BU, at least someone among you is just as ready as you are for spontaneity, for risk, for explosive kindness, for life.","#3392

I think my roommate may have a problem. Last semester, she used to play a sport and kinda eat poorly but hey, it's college. She would weigh herself from time to time and gloat to everyone the second she lost a pound. But this semester she's different--taking her weight to a new extreme. I've found laxatives in the fridge and she'll weigh herself multiple times every few hours. I never see her eating or snacking anymore, and when she does it, she's only eating like a salad a day and occasionally my floor reports vomit in the toilet at like odd hours (like 11 am and it just doesn't look like alcohol puke). I've dealt with eating disorders in the past with other friends, but the problem is I really don't like my roommate, and I feel like if I were to say something, she'd just get mad, deny it, and diet even more. She was skinny to start with, but now she's getting really skinny and I still see her look at herself in the mirror and pinch whatever she can. She literally has one friend and never seems to leave the room, just lays in bed all day, skipping classes a lot of the time to watch DVDs. Help?","#3388

This probably won't get posted, but I'm wearing my anchor ring again. I stopped because anchors have been a recent fad that people think are cute but they have more meaning than that. My ring reminds me that during college as I'm figuring out who I am, I need to find my anchor: something to believe in that is worth staying alive for. I have a tendency to push people away because they deserve better than my troubles. Often being alone has resulted in a fear of never finding someone that will love me at my best, support me at my worst, and accept my faults and flaws. I'm wearing my anchor ring again, however, because it reminds me that I can be my own anchor. It is nice to be wanted and needed, but you do not need to be needed or wanted to be worth something. I wish I figured that out sooner.","#3379

When I pointed out how pretty this one girl was and how he should go talk to her, He abruptly said ""Ummm no she's asian or something"" When I inquired why he said that he simply said ""Honestly, I try to stick with the basic white girls"" This made me feel horrible, 1.) because I am not white so I felt like I was being written off before I had the chance, and 2.) because I felt a pain in my heart knowing that this was probably the mentality of many here at BU. The funny thing is this is probably a guy who would never admit to being racist. And thats just it, being of color and living in a world of racism without ""racists"" is one hell of a life.","#3211

I don't go to BU, or even live anywhere near boston, but BU Confessions has been a strange guilty pleasure of mine. Reading some confessions, I come to a third-handed conclusion that there are strange, unhealthy rifts within the student body that could be mended through love and respect for your fellow humans and colleagues. Open up your mental books and let each other read them without unnecessary judgement and fear. I'm so impressed by many of the attendees that I've met in my Boston travels. You all are surrounded by wonderfully talented, intelligent and beautiful people. How some of you could try to convince each other otherwise seems so silly to me. Yes, I ""don't even go here"" but strangely enough it seems that most of you are surprised by the many, such as myself, who would truly love to. Be well, BU. Unite yourselves. It doesn't take a tragedy to come together.","#3139

It really bothers me how many people I've gotten close to and then suddenly they fell out of my life or I fell out of theirs. At this time last year , I had a friend who I thought would be my best friend at BU ; we completely lost touch with each other and do no more than say ""hi"" when seeing each other on campus. At this time four months ago, I thought I had found a solid ""friend group"", as we called ourselves, some what childishly, that would be my niche here at BU. Now either they've moved or aren't getting along or have found other friends. I thought my best friends from high school would always be there; we still talk but very rarely. I struggle with trusting people too much or caring about people too much because I've come to accept that with almost everyone, you'll get caught up in life and one day you'll just notice they're not part of it anymore. I don't know if this is how friendship normally works in the adult world, but as a kid I always believed that being someones friend came with a certain degree lasting. I don't like how people just drift in and out.I don't like how many people have promised to be there and then weren't . I know I've done it too. So I guess the best thing you can do is tell the people in your life how much they mean to you, right now, and make sure that classes, work, etc, don't get so in the way that they eradicate your relationships with others. And I want to apologize to the people I've disappeared on or haven't reached out to or talked to because I'm ""too busy"". Aren't we all? Aren't we all.","#3086

You have all of your classes off for the week to study for them..I think you should be able to manage. In the meantime, us Engineering students over here have multiple exams, on top of class and lab time, on top of lab reports, regular assignments, and group projects. You have to work in a group? Dude we have semester long group projects in multiple classes at once. You have to write like this super long report that like takes forever and its so hard to like..write so much? Just ONE of our required classes for the semester requires 60 fucking paged lab reports weekly, on top of homework in that class, exams, and a weekly 4 hour lab. You have to pull a few all nighters at the end of the semester? I am LUCKY if I don't have to pull more than 3 all nighters every single week just to get the work done. And no, that is not with going out to Bijou and getting fucked up and spending daddy's money 4 nights a week. That is with working non-stop and through the weekend.

#3072
Tonight, Oct. 31, I left my purple paisley umbrella with a brown wooden handle at Marciano Commons, and upon immediately realizing that I had left it there, I ran back less than five minutes after leaving to get it back. I ran to the second floor, and to my dismay it was gone. I asked the cleaning people, the people who cooked in the station close to my table, and the cashiers downstairs if anyone had seen it or returned it. Unfortunately, no one had, so most likely a student took it. My umbrella fell off of the seat and was behind a chair close to the wall, so it wasn't really visible, which means someone sitting next to me saw it there before I left and immediately snatched it after I left. I remember the few people sitting around me, so to whoever one of you took it, I have this to say: karma is a bitch. While you might think taking something so small and insignificant like an umbrella is nothing to get worked up about, that umbrella was given to me by my father when I was a freshman at BU, and now being a senior, I still use it and appreciate it for sentimental value. And to educate you on what karma is and how it works, it means that whatever you do, specifically the negative choices you decide to make, will come back at you ten-fold, making you instantly regret ever making that choice that led you to being repaid by karma. Unfortunately for you, I tend to have significant sway in how you get affected, because every time someone upsets me, and I send negative energy and the evil eye toward that person, bad shit happens to them. I know this sounds somewhat crazy, but it's true. I'm not a witch, or some other silly thing like that, but what I do have is a strong connection to the natural energy fields that surround Earth and connect us to the universe. So therefore, you my friend, right now at this very moment, are being sent all the negative energy that inhabits this universe and planet. It doesn't matter how significant the bad things happen to you are, wether they be small or big, the fact is that they will happen, it is inevitable. While it is possible that you don't believe in karma, as a victim/ receiver of karma myself, it is very much real and not bullshit. So if you have any sense, and wish to avoid this bad energy from making a significant impact on your life, you should return the umbrella tomorrow to the cashiers at Marciano commons before 3pm, or latest being 8 30 pm. If I were you, the choice is simple, returning a semi-functioning umbrella, or receiving galactic retribution for having stealing that umbrella. Is that umbrella worth that hanging over your head? Next move is yours.","Somebody give this girl her umbrella back...

I've finally come to the conclusion, after struggling here at BU for 3 years, that this is not the right place for me to be.

I've battled depression since I was 14 years old, and some days I feel great, and other days it's too hard to even get up in the morning. I've had this disorder for seven years, and the fact is, sometimes it gets better, and sometimes it doesn't. The thing is, all the times that it wasn't okay... those were the times I expected something or someone else to make it better. The only person who can pull you out of your shit is YOU. A part of my experience with depression in my ""adulthood"" has been realizing that I need to take responsibility for my mind and emotions. I am often too quick to blame it on school and friends and alcohol, when I know, deep down, that my depression defeats me because I let it. If you're suffering, too, I'm not saying you can just ""stop,"" but treatment and recovery are only as effective as what you put into them. If you're going to mope around and romanticize your disorder, it's never going to get better. You're going to get so comfortable pretending that your pain is beautiful, and that someone is going to love it and kiss your scars and make it better, you won't ever know how to make yourself happy. And I don't care what else you learn at this school - if you can't learn how to make yourself happy, you will never make it in the real world.","#3050

I told her about how BU bought it and turned it into Hojo as student housing. She looks as me with a blank face and says, ""You will probably want to avoid living there.""

Last year when I came back to school from winter break, I thought it would be a good idea to bring back some weed. I never tried ""blueberry crush"" before and thought it would be fun to try it with my friends. It was so pungent that I needed to keep it sealed in a glass jar.

It's my floormates telling me to stop whatever I'm doing because it's stinking up the entire floor. All of a sudden we hear RAs on call talking about what they smell and so one of my friends cracks open a tuna can with his bare hands, cuts himself in the process and then pours the tuna juice all over the hallway to try to mask the smell of the weed. Then he goes up to these RAs asking if they want tuna while I'm on my way to the floor below me to ditch the weed in their trash can and bury the blunt in the esplanade. So basically, my friend tearing up a can of tuna saved my career here at BU. Thanks man","#2714

To the girl crying on the second floor of Danielsen yesterday (9/23): Give BU a chance. I'm a sophomore, and last year, I was pretty much miserable here. I came to BU with acute PTSD from a car accident I was in, which made life very difficult for me. I live two hours from Boston but I get extremely homesick and between missing my family, friends, and boyfriend, I wanted nothing to do with this school. On my first exam, after killing myself studying, I got a 38. I assume that you're new here, and I know that the beginning here can really suck. After my first few weeks here, I felt like total crap about myself and was ready to quit. Even when I came back here this year, homesickness alone almost made me want to leave. But it's only been a couple weeks, and this year, it turns out I absolutely love it here. Yes, it sucks being away from home, and it's not always perfect (nothing is!) but I know I'm getting a great education, doing the things I love, and working towards a bright future. You have to figure out what works best for you. If you feel like living in a dorm and relying on the dining hall is ruining your independence, request a room change! There are plenty of great apartments at BU where you're living on your own, no dining plan or anything. If you want to work more, find a second job! This is not at all uncommon here. BU is what you make of it, and you came here for a reason. Don't write this school off before you've even given it a chance, because I almost did, and I would have really regretted it.","#2699

I came to BU with acute PTSD from a car accident I was in, which made life very difficult for me. I live two hours from Boston but I get extremely homesick and between missing my family, friends, and boyfriend, I wanted nothing to do with this school. On my first exam, after killing myself studying, I got a 38. I assume that you're new here, and I know that the beginning here can really suck. After my first few weeks here, I felt like total crap about myself and was ready to quit. Even when I came back here this year, homesickness alone almost made me want to leave. But it's only been a couple weeks, and this year, it turns out I absolutely love it here. Yes, it sucks being away from home, and it's not always perfect (nothing is!) but I know I'm getting a great education, doing the things I love, and working towards a bright future. You have to figure out what works best for you. If you feel like living in a dorm and relying on the dining hall is ruining your independence, request a room change! There are plenty of great apartments at BU where you're living on your own, no dining plan or anything. If you want to work more, find a second job! This is not at all uncommon here. BU is what you make of it, and you came here for a reason. Don't write this school off before you've even given it a chance, because I almost did, and I would have really regretted it.",,1380075233,,,144,5,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=550047088394520&id=455239657875264,

I woke up on a Friday morning only to find some clear fluid on my chair and lacy panties on the ground that did not belong to me and when questioning my room mates they didn't claim it either. My room mate slept perfectly fine and suggested maybe it was the rain, but there was no way that was possible since the surrounding area was dry and then she joked that I may have peed in my sleep. My other room mate asked me to smell her pillows and asked me if it smelled strange. Even though she sleeps like a bear, she believed that some there was a naked drunk girl who came into our room who went straight into her bed and coddled her. Apparently, she sent her out of the room and at that moment of debriefing, a vague recollection of loud noises and banging of the door from the previous night came back to me. From now on, we lock our doors at night.","#2637

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold; the bird froze up and fell to the ground in a large field. While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him! The morals of this story are: Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!","#2391

I will be the first to say that my thoughts are with all those affected by the bombings that occurred during the Boston Marathon. It was a shameless crime which preyed on innocent people. However, it is hard not to notice the sudden surge of patriotism that has taken over my facebook page and text message inbox. In my opinion, Boston was just as much of a strong community on April 14th as it was on April 15, yet not too many people took notice. I am by no means saying that it is wrong to show support in this time of despair; in fact, I think that is exactly what we need. But who says this support has to suddenly stop in a week or two? Its amazing that sometimes it takes a tragedy to show us what we really care about. Boston was there all along. Every single person who you texted or who texted you today was there too. It really only takes a little compassion, some empathy, and maybe holding open a few doors. All I am asking is please don't let this tragedy go unanswered. If you really want justice for those who were wronged take it in your own hands and be the change you want to see in the world.","#2105

I recently added a game much like Farmville to my iPhone. I figured it would be fun to have when I got bored, but as I've played it more and more, I became addicted. It's gotten to the point where I have left class to harvest my crops. I was late to a family dinner because my eggs were ready to be collected. I'm on level fifteen of the game and there are endless levels. I can't stop the madness. I would never be caught dead on an actual farm, but I can't stop with the pigs, cows, sheep, and random peasants who come to collect my eggs and bacon. I'm afraid if I stop now everyone in the game will die. I'm not a murderer, but I'm also not a farmer. I just want my life back.","#2059

After having a Sexual Intercourse Seminar in a Warren bathroom the other day, I started to believe that anything could happen in BU bathrooms. And today, I confirmed my thought. In the men's room on the third floor of SMG, a older man began a casual talk with another man asking if he was a student. With a positive yes in response, the older introduced himself as a candidate for adjunct professor teaching Finance here at BU. As the younger man said ""good luck"" and was about to leave, he asked the man if he was a finance major or had taken any classes. I was shocked by his confidence thinking he would have asked the young man to take his class once he gets the job and I was ready to admire him. He then started recruiting the younger man for internship opportunities in the firm that he currently worked for. Soon after, he even gave the young man his email address and resume asking him to keep in touch... WTF?!","#1837

I just broke up with my girlfriend. It was a long distance thing and I knew it had to end. My best friend decided we should go to a club to meet new girls and blow off some steam. We are only freshmen so we had to find an 18+ club. We chugged a few drinks and went. Most of my memory is spotty, but I remember screaming that we were there to fuck bitches, which the bouncer didn't like. We got in and my friend was completely freaked out because he went into the bathroom and saw people doing drugs. He left after 20 minutes. I, however, was having a great time. I danced from 11 to 3 AM. I stripped my shirt off at some point which made people ask me if I had any drugs to share with them. I was completely sober by this point. Not only did people think I was on X, they also thought I was gay. i know this because a big, well-dressed black man approached me and told me I was a beautiful man. I told him he looked like Shaq, and he giggled. I immediately said I was straight, but he said he just wanted to talk and wanted to buy me a vitamin water. Because the T stopped running, I decided to stay and talk with him until 5am. I found out he graduated from Penn and his name was Duke. By the end, he was inviting me over, gave me his number, and said my asshole would taste like blueberries. Apparently, im a 10 in the gay community. The next day my friend asked what I did for the rest of the night at the club. I told him everything. He immediately thought I was actually gay. To convince him, I deleted duke's number in front of him. Secretly, I wish I still had his number. My asshole could use a tasting. Luckily, BU is the right place for me?","#1771

I pushed her off of me while yelling ""you're in the wrong room!"" I grabbed her by the wrist and led her out of my room. I asked her what room number she is in but all she could do was mutter something incoherently.

There's this girl in CAS, I think she is majoring Economics because I've seen her in three econ classes so far. I think she is of Indian decent but she could be Middle Eastern. She has the most amazing smile you will ever see in BU and her tush is out of the world. Every time she walks into class or walk to the front of the class, all everyone does is stare at her. It makes me madly jealous. She must be a senior. I really want to ask her out, but she always looks very intimidating. I hope she's into white guys and I hope she reads this.","#1094

A few weekends ago, my roommate an I awoke at 3:30 am to a strange tall kid in boxers and a t-shirt creepily coming into our room. We thought it was our friend from across the hall, but when we called his name he didn't answer and proceeded to come over to my bed and tap my ass. Since I was still half asleep and wondering wtf was going on, I had no idea what to make of the situation. The kid left our room without saying anything, but then shortly came back about 2 minutes later. Finally my roommate and I got out of bed, to figure out wtf was going on. We asked him what he was doing, but he legit had no idea and kept insisting he lived in our room despite the fact his name did not match either of the nametags on our door. After constant disbelief and 5 minutes of trying to deliberate with this kid we finally convinced him he did not live in our room, let alone our floor, and we locked the door and called it a night. The next day we saw him in the dhall and there was no sign of him even recognizing us, also he was in Sigma Chi.","#1088

My parents are huge Lord Of The Rings fans. They've been dressing up as the characters every Halloween. They rotate between characters but they've made me dress up as Smeagol every year for as long as I can remember. It became really embarassing since I was about 11. Just when I finally got away from them this year because I was at school on Halloween, the tradition came clawing back into my life. My parents flew in for Halloween weekend - you guessed it - dressed Lord Of The Rings characters. This year it was Gimili and Legolas. And even though I told them there was no way in hell I was dressing up as Smeagol this year, they managed to figure out where the party I was going out to was and forced me to let them tag along. They were marginally popular surprise guests at first, but as the night dragged on everyone thought they were super creepy. And then to top it all off... They left the party about an hour before I did; when I got back to my room, there was a tie wrapped around the door handle. No it wasn't my roommate bringing a girl back. It was them. Using my bed. For God only knows what. Dressed as Gimili and Legolas.","#1076

BU is truly a prime example of an artificial utopia. It is unfortunate, however, how dark and cynical this place really is. We dread our work and live for the weekends.

So he started to feel me up and then I realized that I hadn't brushed my teeth and my mouth still tasted like eggy vomit. so I brushed my teeth in the bathroom and came back to my room and he was there, only he was hooking up with another girl! she did not look familiar to me. I screamed ""what are you doing here?"" and she turned around and said ""what are YOU doing here?"" and she turned to the guy and said,"" wait, you're not my boyfriend!"" and then another guy appeared next to me in the doorway in only his boxers and was like ""Karen? What is this?"" and then she said ""Jake?"" and turned to the guy from my WR100 class and then to the guy in the doorway and said ""I thought this was you!"" and WR100 pointed to me and said ""I thought you were HER"" and then Jake said ""I thought you loved me"" and I said ""what are you doing in my room?"" she said ""what are you doing in MY room?"" and then I look on the door and realize that the doortags say ""KAREN"" and ""ELISE"" and I am neither Karen nor Elise, and then I remember that I am now a Sophomore and haven't lived in Warren since last year. I ran out before they could call the cops but I heard later that WR100 and Karen and Jake had a threesome. Point is, kids, never eat raw eggs.","#637
