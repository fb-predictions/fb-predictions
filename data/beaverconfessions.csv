We have come a long way and encountered a lot as a community together. MIT is such an incredible place with amazing people that I know for a fact will change the world, and I hope that you guys can all gather and embrace each other back on campus sooner rather than later.
For those of you who are starting out at MIT, whether it be as an undergrad or grad student, you have such an exciting journey ahead of you and I challenge you to take hold of every opportunity and meet as many people as you can along the way. For those of you who are current students, hang in there, you are amazing and you CAN do this. And, most importantly, for those of us graduating today as members of the Class of 2020, we did it!!
We laughed, we danced, we cried, but most importantly, we all got to get a taste of what it means to utter the phrase “IHTFP”. I love this community and this school, and I hope to see you all soon.
IHTFP,

A 6.172 fanfic
May 25, 2020
---
Autumn.
The season of the golden crisps had finally arrived. Campus smelled distinctly of pumpkin spice latte, emanating from the stands of the baseball field outside of New Vassar as students practiced on the grass. Students and professors alike rejoiced in the pristine air in their first semester back at college since the coronavirus scare earlier in the year. President Reif had been hesitant to announce whether fall semester would be on-campus—everyone was understandably relieved when the news came through.
Everyone, except me.
I hated going to class. I hated waking up at 8:30 in the morning, the feeling of 10G’s of gravity on my eyelids dragging them back to the mattress. I hated rushing through my shower, brushing, shaving, and breakfast, all in the thirty minutes before class. And I hated that I could never wake up for running club (7:30 at the Z-Center on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings), as much as I loved Lara and all her jokes which somehow always managed to slightly miss the mark. Admittedly, that part of her was pretty charming.
But what I hated even more was going to office hours. This semester, I had taken the class 6.172 Performance Engineering. A friend, Endrias, had convinced me to take it—citing it as the best class he had ever taken at MIT.
Evidently, Endrias was quite the masochist.
I hadn’t struggled in many classes in the past, but 6.172 was different. I could never stay awake in class. Having spent minimal time on the first of four projects, letting my partner do all the work, I found myself completely lost when the second project came out. What were we supposed to implement again? Something about stabbing lines into each other…
The morning of November 14th, as I blinked awake, I was met with the darkest nightmare of my life. To figure out project two, I needed to ask for help at office hours.
---
“Oh my,” she sighed, “this won’t do…”
It really wouldn’t. I had painstakingly optimized my intersection detection algorithm, inlining almost all the functions I could see and minimizing any repeat computations in the huge code-base that the staff had given us. But it still wasn’t fast enough. Taking around 10 seconds to run, the project was as slow as Deneb’s trail across the sky above the northern hemisphere at the end of summer. It was nowhere close to the 2 seconds that all the other teams were getting.
“Are you working with anybody on the project?” Her mouth formed a perfect “O” shape, like in the big-O notation. Her breath was slightly minty.
“N-no… I didn’t get along well with my project partner, so we ended up separating after the beta submission,” I said, ashamed. Team projects were difficult, and my previous partner had only been free during Friday nights. But anime club had always been held on Friday nights as well (7:00 in room 3-133)—how could I have abandoned perhaps my only friend, the anime club president, Tony, to run the club by himself? Alas, the 6.172 collaboration was never meant to be.
“Oh no… I’m so sorry to hear that! Studying alone is really difficult,” she empathized.
The TAs at office hours were quite nerveracking. They loomed over me, their presence like a whale about to swallow the school of minnows which were my C++ code. Please, let the lambdas and function templates live, the minnows begged. But it was to no avail. Against the tide of course staff adherence to classical C conventions, even snake_case naming, more functional constraints were no match. Every minute I spent in office hours, I spent daydreaming about Typescript. Even the TA with the dyed hair was a little intimidating. But she was different.
Hina Tachibana. Of course. That was her name. Hina, with her green eyes and brunette long hair, and a gray turtleneck sweater to boot, was a fireplace amidst the blizzard. The sweater was a perfect match for her motherly aura, warm, comfortable, and soft, just like her eyes, a glossy sand dune, the delicate child of mother nature as her hands shaped the clay of pre-civilization first into beauty, then into kindness, and finally into Hina. She was perfect.
“Hello? Hello…” she whispered into my ear, her voice so close I felt her vitality travel through all 26 bones of my vertebral column. I sprung back into present-day.
“I know it must be hard for you, having to do this project all by yourself. Oh! How about this,” Hina exclaimed as she lifted her right index finger. I could practically see the light bulb light up right above her glossy brown nails. “Let’s work together on Saturday night! I’ll make sure you finish!”
She winked. It was a wink that stuck with me all the way until Saturday night, a wink that I swear could have cured AIDS, had I had better grades in my organic chemistry class.
---
“Who cares about quad-trees,” I lamented, “I just want to experience the college life. Really, Hina, lazily-updated seg-trees were enough.” The final part of the project was to implement quad-tree updates to speed up line intersection detection by bypassing the need to reconstruct the quad-tree at each time step.
Finally, Saturday night had come. I had trekked across campus to arrive at her cozy single on dormitory row. Sitting right beside me, Hina’s reflective green eyes drifted up towards the ceiling, the light from her desk lamp blazing a path around her pupil like the sun on a hot day in the desert. Instinctively, I met her gaze upon her ceiling, a white drywall colored like the orange sunset by the warmness of her presence as it seemed to diffuse into the air through the steam from her cup of hot chocolate. Her room was a welcome repose from the cold outside.
“And what do you want to be a part of your college experience, Gil?”
I didn’t know what to answer. Classes, research, or sports? My college years had left me jaded. I didn’t feel like there was anything left to look forward to.
“Oh, I don’t know… I wish I could care more about classes or clubs, but they’re just not interesting to me. I’ve met some pretty cool people here, though, so perhaps part of it is making friends, or something more.” Once again, I lost myself in her aquamarine eyes as she shifted her gaze back to me.
“Something more?” Hina’s sweater was different from the turtleneck she donned days before. It was a cut lower, revealing just enough skin around her collarbones to be attractive but not seductive. It was held together by big brown buttons at the front, seemingly hand-woven, evidenced by the larger holes in the fabric of the sweater.
“Something… like love, I guess,” I stuttered. Flushed, perhaps from the warmth of her room, I turned my attention back to the mess on my laptop screen and hacked out a few lines. I was so close to finishing the project.
Slowly, I felt her hair graze my neck; a tickle, as playful, as innocent, as a boy and a girl playing doctor together. She placed her tender fingers upon mine, guiding them, rubbing them up and down on my Microsoft© Windows Precision Touchpad as her eyes massaged themselves over my code.
“Oh my, oh my…” she whispered, the softest of whispers, as a siren would sing to Odysseus, as Circe would entrance his men. “You’re so close to finishing, aren’t you, dear…”
It was then that I became aware of how thin, how simple her sweater was, the only obstacle in my eye’s path to her body. Hina knew, had known, that I was watching, waiting for glimpses of her nakedness through the hand-woven holes of her black sweater her grandmother must have crafted for her.
“If your program can run in under 2 seconds, I’ll give you a reward,” she giggled, pretending not to notice as her sweater loosened around her shoulders. My fingers raced across the keyboard, hastily searching for the --fast-math compiler flag to parallelize floating-pointer operations. Hina fingered the run command herself. And… aha! I was finally done.
Breasts scarcely covered now, her right hand brushed long, sensual hair behind shaped ears as she leaned in, her lips glistening wet against the warm glow, an oasis amidst the blizzard now brewing outside. I relinquished, a flow of euphoria through my veins as I, too, closed my eyes and lifted my hands from the keyboard to comply with her desire for the rest of our night together.
No additional quad-trees were constructed that night.","#42858 Love, Hina

As for astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the movement of the earth consisted in renouncing the immediate feeling of the immobility of the earth and the similar feeling of the movement of the planets, so for history the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of the person to the laws of space, time, and causes consists in renouncing the immediate feeling of the independence of one’s person. But, as in astronomy the new view said: “True, we do not feel the movement of the earth, but by assuming its immobility, we arrive at an absurdity; whereas, by assuming the movement which we do not feel, we arrive at laws,” so, too, in history the new view says: “True, we do not feel our dependence, but by assuming we are free, we arrive at an absurdity; whereas, by assuming our dependence on the external world, time, and causes, we arrive at laws.”
In the first case, the need was to renounce the consciousness of a nonexistent immobility in space and recognize a movement we do not feel; in the present case, it is just as necessary to renounce a nonexistent freedom and recognize a dependence we do not feel.

While I agree with the fact that more cores is only good for rendering in Solidworks, a better GPU is actually kind of important if you are doing large complicated assemblies. When you start to get into the 100s of parts range in a single assembly you need better graphics in order for it to render everything on your screen. Otherwise you end up with weird things such as screws showing up as rectangular prisms.

Why is it that we’re okay with death in these cases, but not in situations like an infectious disease? Is it because there’s an element of risk acceptance when driving (or to a lesser extent, buying a toaster) that isn’t present with a virus? What about the 6,000 pedestrians who didn’t consent to the risk of driving that die in car accidents every year? How does one quantify the number deaths that are acceptable for minor quality of life improvements? Making public policy must be hard af.",,1590213558,,,82,12,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3391610087574681&id=462508190484900,

3384296128306077,"#42647 To all of the people wanting laptop recommendations:
As for determining the specs you want a good way to do this would be to google the recommended specs for the most intensive program you plan on using. This will often be a CAD or game program. If you are running neither of those then you will probably be fine with quad core i5 or better, but if you are doing coding your code may run faster with a faster processor or a processor with more cores depending on if it is written to run with multiple threads.
Assuming many of you will be running Solidworks, you will want at least 8gb RAM, at least a quad core 6th gen i5, at least a 900 series GeForce, and at least a 256gb SSD. If you are planning on having a lot of internet tabs open then you may want more RAM. If you are planning on having a lot of programs open or you are planning on doing renderings you may want more cores. If you want your system to be faster and more future proofed you may want an i7 or i9. If you want to drive multiple high resolution external displays then you might want a better GPU.

Most internet browsers, especially Chrome, are huge memory hogs and will eat up as much RAM as you can give them. Especially if you like have a ton of tabs open. Some laptops have upgradable RAM. If you need to save money you can skimp on RAM and upgrade it later as you need it. Just double check that it is user upgradable. A good source is ifixit. If you do upgrade double check that the RAM you order is compatible with your laptop. If you have multiple slots make sure the RAM you get is the same speed. If they aren't then the faster one will throttle to the speed of the slower one. It is best, but not necessary to have the same model number of RAM in each slot.
Hyperthreading has been found to have multiple security risks, so if you are very paranoid and concerned about the security of what you have on your laptop you may want to consider turning it off which will reduce performance or getting a processor that doesn't have hyperthreading.
If you are concerned about security you will want to get the newest generation processor you can. Currently 10th gen is the newest. Newer generation is better.
Typically for GPUs the pattern is that say a 980 is roughly comparable to 1070 which is roughly comparable to a 2060. Oh. this is like one of those stupid find the pattern problems from the ACT. Bigger numbers are better. Most of you won't be taking advantage of the ray tracing cores in the RTX series.
The SSD size heavily depends on how much you use cloud storage. You also only want to fill the drive about half full for maximum performance and life. I have found that a 1tb is about what I need, but if I used cloud storage I could probably go to a 256 or 512. As with the RAM some computers have user upgradable SSDs, so you can also skimp here and upgrade later. Again, just double check that it is user upgradable and if you order an SSD make sure it is compatible. M.2 SSDs can be particularly confusing in terms of compatibility.
A note on the i9:
Yes, it is better, but becasue it is better, faster, and has more threads it also generates more heat. Many laptops especially the thin ones can not cool this chip well and it often ends up throttling to the same performance as the i7 version of the same laptop. If you are going to get an i9 make sure to research if it actually improves the performance onthat laptop.
I did not consider AMD CPUs and GPUs and am not providing recommendations for them simply because they were terrible when I was researching my laptop, so I know very little about them except that they are actually competitive now and are worth considering.
One thing about AMD GPUs is that Solidworks and many games are slightly more optimized for Nvidia's CUDA cores, but it is a small enough difference that you won't notice.
This is getting long, so notes on common brands will be on another post.","#42647 To all of the people wanting laptop recommendations:
As for determining the specs you want a good way to do this would be to google the recommended specs for the most intensive program you plan on using. This will often be a CAD or game program. If you are running neither of those then you will probably be fine with quad core i5 or better, but if you are doing coding your code may run faster with a faster processor or a processor with more cores depending on if it is written to run with multiple threads.
Assuming many of you will be running Solidworks, you will want at least 8gb RAM, at least a quad core 6th gen i5, at least a 900 series GeForce, and at least a 256gb SSD. If you are planning on having a lot of internet tabs open then you may want more RAM. If you are planning on having a lot of programs open or you are planning on doing renderings you may want more cores. If you want your system to be faster and more future proofed you may want an i7 or i9. If you want to drive multiple high resolution external displays then you might want a better GPU.

I’m gonna be a junior at this point with my technical GPA being full of P. My actual grades in 6.042 and 6.006 are ridiculously poor and I just hate it all.
However, I’ve found a love for learning languages like no other. I’m currently minoring in Japanese, and absolutely love it. I want to learn Spanish and Russian next, and even more in the future. I didn’t really know about it much before, but isn’t Linguistics the study of languages or something? I feel I’d be much happier following a major that aligns better with my pursuit of learning languages and international studies.
Problem is, I have no idea where a major in linguistics could take me. I’ve mentioned this to family as well, and they keep telling me to stop all this nonsense and work towards becoming a computer engineer (or whatever that means at this point because I don’t even know to be fair)

3380091225393234,"#42624 I beg you, if you care about the LGBTQ+ community, read this even if it seems too long. Just to help me out <3
I am a gay who have developed crushes on straight men for all his life, unfortunate I know. Also, I'm 100% sure that if my parents knew I am gay they will fucking kill me and all my relatives will hate me, on the best chance, I will be kicked off my house for my entire life.
But finally, when I got to know a person who I truly loved, and whom I am sure that he is 100% gay I found out that he doesn't want to admit it just like me! He is shy from his position in the surrounding society so he keeps his secret. However, from my expertise with being a gay male, I know exactly what does a gay man look like. That guy has been my best FRIEND for over a year now, but I don't know how can I tell him to show off, or how can I show off myself to him. This frustrates me every moment I see him and I wish I could just hug him forever and admit my love to him, but life never gave my the chance. Please help me out, tell me how to make him reveal what he is hiding or even how to approach him in a life partner, not a friend, way.
One last thing, please don't tell me to 'not to be shy' or to 'try to tell my parents' or even 'try to tell your friends only' because all these are, definitely, not going to work—believe me I'm the one in the middle of the situation.

Now that I have much more experience with hiring, I’ve come to believe that among hiring managers in our industry, the strong preference for work/company experience (even over academic performance or gpa) significantly perpetuates industry biases towards privileged applicants. Basically, those applicants who start out with the strong social connections (a key aspect of socioeconomic privilege) that are a huge factor in landing their first role/internship at a major company, then have a much easier time getting follow-up roles at major companies for the rest of their career. Meanwhile, students who don’t have access to the same valuable connections when starting their career - the hardest time to “get experience” in the first place - will struggle significantly more with being hired throughout their career. When making hiring decisions, I absolutely value experience tremendously, but I also see how much harder it is to start earning experience for socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants.

3380079632061060,"#42549 Hello friends at MIT. I must confess, I have never understood the stock market. Can someone explain?
Specifically:
I do know about cryptocurrencies. People call Bitcoin speculative investing because Bitcoin has no real worth. I am not here to talk about cryptocurrencies.
The question is, how are stocks any different from Bitcoin? Some stocks pay dividends, but most do not. The only reason many people buy stock is because expect it to increase in value. But how is this any different than Bitcoin?
The argument is that stocks are somehow ""tied"" to the value of a company. But what does this mean? From what I understand, if a stock is $37, this means that someone bought that stock for $37. So how is that tied to the value of the company?
It's not like there is some formula for stock price based on how the company is doing (unless there is?). A lot of companies report stuff quarterly, but its not like stock prices are then changed according to said non-existent formula every quarter (unless they are?).
So how exactly is stock tied to the value of the company? Is the formula informal?
I suppose if you bought enough stock you would control the company but most people don't do this.
Someone please help. I've had this discussion with some people before, but never to the end of my thoughts. Presumably because they don't know the answer themselves.","#42549 Hello friends at MIT. I must confess, I have never understood the stock market. Can someone explain?

3343284645740559,"#42168 So obviously Hollywood is gonna make movies about the 2019-2020 pandemic. I proposed the following movies.
The Original Trilogy
- “Virus Wars Episode 4: A New Virus” where we meet a young researcher named Luke VirusSmasher living amidst the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. He learns of his connection to the Force and his father’s mysterious death by the WHO general Darth Vader. The film ends of course when Luke, aided by his fellow Rebels, crashes his Ford Fiesta into the WHO super-weapon known as the Death Tower which transmits 5G signals that causes COVID-19.
- “Virus Wars Episode 5: The Virus Claps Back!” where after the destruction of the Death Tower the WHO is furious! Luke travels to Kansas, the origin of the 1918 Spanish flu, where he begins his training under Master Dr. Fauci, a brilliant epidemiologist that used to work on the US Coronavirus Task Force before President Trump banished him. In the fields of Kansas, Luke learn how to use the Force. Stuff happens, and his friends are captured by Darth Vader. Luke leaves Kansas before he can complete his training. He confronts Vader and undergoes a duel with their Apple iSabers X where Luke loses his hand. Vader then tells him the truth: he is his father! Luke gets rescued by his friends on the Millenium Cybertruck. The future is unclear.
- “Virus Wars Episode 6: The Return of the Epidemiologist” where Luke completes his training as an Force-wielding epidemiologist. He rescues his friend from Weinstein the hut and is determined to meet his father lord Vader and try to change him to the light. It seems during all this time, the WHO has built another Death Tower, ready to emit more 5G. Luke and the rebels attack! Eventually Luke confronts Vader and WHO emperor Palpatine inside the Death Tower. Palpatine tried to turn Luke to the dark side. But he refuses. Palpatine tries to kill Luke, but Vader overpowers palatine and throws him off the tower. Vader begs forgiveness to Luke, before dying of his injuries. The second Death Tower is destroyed and COVID cases begin to go down. The corrupt WHO is dismantled and we enter a new age of peace.
Then a few years later when our cgi gets even better we can make a new “prequel trilogy” that many people will initially dislike but will eventually grow to love (well, they’ll love the third one at least)
Then a few more years later we’ll make a “sequel trilogy” that is more of a hollow shell of its predecessors, making the original trilogy actually seem better.","#42168 So obviously Hollywood is gonna make movies about the 2019-2020 pandemic. I proposed the following movies.

Never chase after anyone
Dont fall in love fast
There are no soulmates. There are people you would have a happier relationship with and others not so much. But no one is “the one”
No one is meant to be. But you CAN make life work with almost anyone
Don’t idealize them. It’s easy to just daydream about all the ways they are amazing but you can become blind to other things
Don’t get attached too soon
Be yourself. Not in the cliche way. Be yourself in that don’t say you like all the same things they do. Don’t pretend to be someone you are not
Your value does not depend on them and their value does not depend on you. You can have your own lives while still being together
Never change yourself for them. And they shouldn’t change themselves for you
Don’t let them promise big things. If there is something they are struggling with, goals should be realistic, not idealistic
Generally, people do not change, no matter how big the promises are
If you see yourself actually dating that person (aka not just a one night stand or fwb), no sex on first date. You shouldn’t feel like you have to prove yourself in bed no matter how good you are or how bad you/they want to

I'm a Mexican who happened to be born in the USA while my parents where doing grad school but lived my whole life in Mexico. I spent 4 years at MIT and afterwards decided to go back to Mexico, so I don't really identify as American.
Yet I got my check and it's like. So dumb. How even just being born in the right place can give you arbitrary privilege. Cause if you think America has had it rough let me tell you it's much worse in the third world for sure. I'm lucky enough to be in a stable situation, but I'm watching pretty much everything and everyone I know crumble into poverty. Yet here I am, not only receiving full pay while staying at home, but also getting my full $1200 which with the recent Mexican peso devaluation is worth even more! Just think about it, while the devaluation has been devastating for so many people, I get to benefit from it just because I get my first world privilege in the form of US dollars. Because I was bron in the right place.
And yeah, some of you might feel like $1200 is not even that much for American standards but trust me, here that is a lot of money. Our covid stimulus plan came out a few weeks ago in the form of $200 USD loans per person (interest free, but LOANS). That's what's supposed to keep a person alive through this whole crisis while every person with the god-given privilege of being born American gets $1200 and possibly more later. This world is so unreal.
I decided to donate my whole stimulus to a charity donating ventilators in Mexican hospitals and frankly I encourage anyone who is receiving full pay and doesn't need the stimulus to do the same, even if it's for American charities or whatever country you are from. This is a zero sum game. It's great that your country can hand out that kind of money to prevent a depression, but know that for a country to be this rich it has to be at other people's expenses.","#41540 I just got my covid check a few days ago and honestly it felt just wrong.

The reason a lot of people support legalizing prostitution is not because ""women should be able to do whatever job they want,"" that's just the argument provided by privileged individuals unaware of the real reasons women are driven to prostitution. A lot of times women turn to prostitution because they have no other way to support themselves or those they love, it is not because they ""want to"" and it is not because they're ""expressing feminism."" Because prostitution is illegal, these women face horrible dangers on a daily basis. Not only do they often suffer abuse from the pimps who control their livelihoods, but they also face abuse from clients. But they can't do anything about it or report anyone to the police because they themselves are considered criminals. That is why we need to legalize prostitution. The law obviously does nothing to prevent it, all it does is prevent the prostitutes from receiving the same protections and rights as any other citizen. The laws protect the corrupt pimps who take most of the prostitute's earnings and the clients who take out their anger on someone who doesn't have the luxury of owning their own body.

I love him and care about him so much. But the butterflies haven't been there for a while. I'm short with him, getting upset over small things.

On the other hand however, MIT administration isn’t taking these kinds of measures to protect us. :( They have canceled events of 150+ people, but in reality even events/classes of 60 people are dangerous. After all, the Biogen conference coronavirus cases happened in an event that was only ~60 people! I would feel a lot better if the administration switched classes to an online format as much as possible to prevent the virus from spreading on campus.
I’m very unsure about venturing out to classes during this situation. I have a health condition that makes me more at-risk for bad outcomes from pneumonia-like viruses. When the first person nearby MIT got the coronavirus (despite it being only a block or two away from MIT campus), I wasn’t concerned at first. But since then, the numbers have increased to 13, then 28, then 41… !!!
On Monday, I skipped class. My roommate skipped class too. This is the first time in my entire life that I have ever skipped a class for any reason other than being legitimately too sick to walk. I was praying that MIT administration would announce changing classes to be online or via Skype (or otherwise take more concrete action to protect students & professors), but sadly I’ve heard nothing. Meanwhile, some high schools in the area are shutting down…
Currently, I am not the only person who feels strongly about this situation. Many of my friends and coworkers are of the same opinion. However, despite what most of us feel, we are helpless. Every single day, we dread going to classes and yet, are forced to risk an infection to attend classes because of the fear of missing content and incomplete assignments.
I think that we should all, as students, encourage our professors to take measures that will allow students to continue engaging with course material 100% while also protecting us all (professors and students alike) from exposure to the virus. For example, professors could video tape their lectures, take photos of what they write on the blackboard, and/or post all of their lecture content entirely online. These such small measures would greatly reassure us and protect us all during this uncertain time while we are waiting to see how bad this virus situation gets.
Our government is already stating that the coronavirus situation is just going to spread and get worse. So why not start preparing NOW, while the situation is still manageable?
If you agree with this MIT confessions post, PLEASE get together with your classmates and email your professors to ask them to take action to help protect us from the virus! Any and every step they take is greatly appreciated by all of us, especially those of us with at-risk health conditions!

Is the Lorax some sort of elected representative for the trees? (No, you degenerate course 6s, not those kinds of trees.) Do the trees like their representative more than we like ours? If you at all care about the trees, please join me in my quest to learn the language of the trees so we can find out, once and for all, if they do, in fact, like their (elected?) official.
Even if the Lorax was elected, how did this election occur? Do the trees have some sort of hierarchy in which the number of votes a tree gets is directly proportional to its height? Is the Truffula tree forest divided into arbitrary sections, each of which gets some number of votes? Do the smaller sections have proportionally more representation? Does the Lorax speak for all of the trees or just for its supporters? There is a lot to uncover here, and we are only just scratching the surface.
If you would like to learn more about tree welfare, please consider enrolling in 12.228 for the upcoming semester. In this class offered by the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, we will discuss topics such as problematic tree-lorax relations in children's literature and how this will affect the youth of society.

3100898629979163,"#38372 I've read so many confessions that I relate to about depression, isolation, lack of confidence, inability to get out of bed. It's good to know I'm not the only one (an inherently selfish notion, since it presupposes that others feel the same as me, and the part of me that doesn't find solace from relating wishes these types of feelings on nobody). I'm seriously emotionally unstable right now - every time I wake up I feel like shit, and it may subside later in the day or last for the rest of it. I'm crying way more than usual, and I completely broke down in front of faculty here - which might be good, who knows? They were super supportive...
I'm a senior now and I've always had mental health issues at MIT, and have a lot of friends that struggle with similar issues. God I've been to McLean for visits so many times at this point... This school can really break some people.
My strategy for dealing with it has been opening up to close friends, and seeing an off-campus therapist after feeling like MIT Medical doesn't really suffice. It's been kind of effective. I'm slowly improving and making small steps towards getting things figured out. I've even reached out to people in the comments of other similar confessions who've offered support, although honestly nobody's really replied to me when I do. Maybe it's because I've never been OP. Anyway, my attempts at controlling my emotions are getting better (yay!) and I just want to stay as positive and as focused on gradual improvement as my fucked mind allows for.
This is supposed to be my last semester and I'm really looking forward to leaving, but 1. given my current mental situation my productivity has tanked so it's actually likely I don't pass everything to get the credits I need and 2. I have no plans after college. I want to leave and find stability, but my parents don't have money to provide for me, and I've just been avoiding the job search. It's fucking ridiculous: I'm anxious about not getting a job which really SHOULD be making me look harder, but it just makes me look less. I really can't afford to take another semester, or not find a job - afford in a financial sense, and in a mental health sense. Not going to lie, I naively thought the search would be easier given that I'm an MIT student, but most places I've applied to never even emailed back. I need a better job application strategy and schedule, ugh. Maybe it's because I'm terrible at marketing myself.
I'm getting super fearful about catching COVID19. As soon as I find symptoms I'm going to seek help to protect the rest of the community and my friends, but 2 weeks or more of containment in my mental state and with so much at stake is fucking terrifying. I recently went to a review session for an upcoming exam, and I kid you not I unwittingly sat in front of someone that was I'll with something - she was sneezing and coughing a lot. I didn't find another seat after sitting there - first because it'd interrupt the session, but second because I didn't want to make the sick person feel self-conscious... I also woke up this morning to a roomate's friend coughing in our bathroom.
Anyway, I don't know what this confession is supposed to be, - I've stitched together a bunch of random shit without much cohesion. Just felt compelled to write my first confession I guess, and had a lot of material for it. I know there are others that feel similarly to me, and just undergrad peers in general trying to reach their goals, and to all of you I wish the best of luck.

if you brush your teeth for 2 minutes a day, and assuming you brush your teeth twice a day, then that’s 4 minutes of running water. water flows out of the faucet at an average of 2 gallons per minute. that’s a WHOLE EIGHT GALLONS of water you could be saving!! PER DAY. PER DAY. and that’s literally 1440 GALLONS PER (the school) YEAR!!! you could be saving 1440 gallons of water per year just by turning the faucet off when you're *gasp* not even using it!!
Do you know how many places in the US and around the world lack clean water, are in drought, have damaged environments, etc. because of the water wastage incurred by the lack of water conservation awareness by people like you??? that’s millions of peoples lives !!
If you’re going to give me that wAtEr cYcLe shit, guess what, let me introduce you to something you should’ve learned in elementary school -
Less than 1% of the earth’s water is fresh water (not trapped in glaciers), which means that only 1% of the water on earth can be used !! When you waste water, you’re draining the usable water that we’re already running out of!! AND on top of that you’re wasting resources used to process the water
it’s 2020 guys PLEASE have some self-awareness. it’s not about ‘your lifestyle’ - you don’t deserve to “live your lifestyle” if living your lifestyle means depraving other people of theirs. living in a place where clean water is a given is a privilege and you should recognize that and conserve the fucking water.
the fact that we can EMPATHIZE gives humans humanity so please USE THAT PART OF YOUR BRAIN A LITTLE MORE OFTEN. And if not, then …conserving water now and forming good habits can help lower your bills in the future… if you care about that...

3058287434240283,"#37258 To 36972: this was a response to you
To 37179: you are faster than me but now I've written this all out so I'm still gonna send it. Honestly 1000% agree with your points and your anger. I write this with the intention of ""I'm making an appeal to try and convince people"" but your reaction is the appropriate magnitude of feelings. I also come from a more privileged background so I don't face as many of these compounding economic issues like you do.
TL;DR: fat shaming is not an appropriate response to the health risks of bring overweight, and that's what body positivity is responding to
I feel like a lot of people seem to genuinely just not get the point of body positivity/fat acceptance. It's not about health or advocating for people to be unhealthy or anything like that. Because fat shaming also isn't really about health. It's about societally trained disgust towards people who aren't skinny enough, which is unwarranted and damaging.
Think about a fat person versus someone with some relatively stigma-free illness, like type one diabetes. If our society allocated stigma proportionately to how unhealthy someone is, you'd expect these people to both feel a lot of shame about themselves. But that's just not the case.
Your rebuttal to that might be that fat people are shamed because they are responsible for their health problems. If I were writing a well researched essay I'd find some facts about how there are million confounding factors and things that make this not a level playing field, but this is a confessions post and that's not actually even necessary for my argument. We don't shame people with other health problems that they could be doing something about in the same way. Although smoking is becoming less socially acceptable I think, it has definitely been glamorized in the past despite it's obviously unhealthy effects. Or if someone mentions they have to go get a cavity filled at the dentist, it's not something they're embarrassed by, even though they may have been able to prevent it by brushing their teeth better. I know that none of these examples are an exact match, but ultimately I find the ""we treat fat people poorly because they have made themselves unhealthy"" not a convincing argument because it just doesn't apply in the same way to basically any other physical condition.
At this point though I think it's necessary to expand on what I mean by ""fat people being shamed by society."" People will say incredibly rude things about people who are overweight. I remember a girl I knew in high school saying that she thought fat people were gross and that she didn't want to touch them. You hear stories from fat people who become thin and they're treated just so much better than they were before. These are just things I can list off the top of my head. (Number 37179 is another example of this.) But honestly I don't think anyone needs convincing that fat people are treated like shit.
I also can say some things from personal experience. For context, I'm female with a BMI of around 29. I can shop in both plus size and normal sizes. I don't feel like my weight affects me in my day to day life--its not like I'm super easily winded or something. I would say most people would not describe me as fat, but I would certainly not be skinny by anyone's definition.
I'd say I have been aware of being not as skinny as most girls since middle school--like I distinctly remember in 6th grade worrying about sucking in my gut. For a long time after that I just never felt positively about my body. Once I started dating, I definitely had an uptick in my self image, but since then I would say my body image has fluctuated pretty wildly. There will be times when I can look at myself in the mirror and feel pretty good. But it can change really quickly. Like just last week I saw a picture of myself and I was like, ""who is this disgusting person?"" I've literally been hooking up with a guy before and, as he says nice things to me, thought ""he's wrong, you're just fat garbage, why are you even doing this."" Like what the actual fuck? This is not to say this is what everyone experiences, but I think this gives you some context of why body positivity is so important to some people. It is just really hard some times to deal with not being skinny, and I am not getting the worst if what people deal out.
To put it another way: our culture teaches everyone that fat people are gross. It encourages an unattainable ideal of skinniness that can is just completely out if reach for some people. (Side note: it's not like it's some natural phenomrnon where humans just naturally think being skinny is hot. I don't really want to get into that can of worms here, but suffice it to say that I'm completeky convinced this obsession with thinness is learned behavior.) It's not like overweight people have not internalized this message that fat people are gross or ugly or shameful. It gets turned around into self loathing.
Here's the icing on the cake: in my opinion, if your goal is to make overweight people lose weight or be healthier, fat shaming is a shit way to do it. Losing weight is hard. It's not like fat people are failing to do something easy. Eating well, exercising, and keeping track of it all is time consuming and expensive. It takes support from people around you.
Imagine you have a friend who you think isn't working hard enough in school. Would you try to make them feel like shit and insult them? No. You would bring it up in a sensitive way and try to help them change their study habits or something. It's possible you might have some friend where insulting and shaming them is the right way to motivate them. Then go ahead, do that approach once you know the person--but most people don't respond well to that. Despite this, the make-the-person-feel-like-shit method is our current collective response to people being overweight.
Even through the ups and downs of my body image, I've never been like ""ah, my eating habits are perfectly healthy and I don't need to exercise more."" Personally, I wish I went to the gym more because it makes me feel good. But the healthy outlook of ""I want to eat well so I feel good"" is what I experience on the highs of this body image cycle. Unhealthy outlooks like ""it's hopeless and I shouldn't try"" or ""maybe I should give bulimia a try"" are what I have felt on the lows.
Shame is what body positivity is responding to. It's not operating from a neutral point and telling overweight people to be proud, it's starting from a point where a lot of them are ashamed and feel like shit and telling them that actually, society is wrong about them. Granted, this is my straight perspective, but I think It's kind of similar to how certain elements of LGBT pride can seem aggressive to straight people, but it's to make up for the years of bigotry LGBT people go through. So yeah, Lizzo shaking her bare ass at a basketball game is a little overboard. But I also have found get music really empowering and help me feel good about myself.
So please, next time you want to complain about body positivity encouraging people to be unhealthy or make fun of some fat person to your friend who might be self conscious about their own body, consider whether you are actually just couching your disgust for fat people in mildly more socially acceptable terms/some way that gives you a little bit less cognitive dissonance. Is it worth the damage?","#37258 To 36972: this was a response to you

Granted, this is my straight perspective, but I think It's kind of similar to how certain elements of LGBT pride can seem aggressive to straight people, but it's to make up for the years of bigotry LGBT people go through. So yeah, Lizzo shaking her bare ass at a basketball game is a little overboard. But I also have found get music really empowering and help me feel good about myself.
So please, next time you want to complain about body positivity encouraging people to be unhealthy or make fun of some fat person to your friend who might be self conscious about their own body, consider whether you are actually just couching your disgust for fat people in mildly more socially acceptable terms/some way that gives you a little bit less cognitive dissonance.

Yeah well ok so a few weeks ago I started seeing this new boy right and he asked me when was the last time I had been tested for STIs, and idk why but I had never done that before lol. He looks at me like yikes so I'm like fine I'll get tested. so I go down to MIT medical to get tested right and it's totally free thank God and they ask me all these questions about my sexual history and I do the test and a few days later I get a call and apparently I tested positive! (That's bad) So I get a call from the doctor right and they're asking me if I had sex in Bangladesh, and I'm like yeah why, and they asked where, and so I told them about my trip and that I had had sex with a man in this old Buddhist market town near the beach called Cox's, and they said they thought I had contracted a rare STD that is apparently only found in that area and would need to come in for further testing. Fuuuck. Well so I ask what it is and the doctor says that it's so rare it's actually named after the region of Sugandha, and it can have a lot of negative health effects, and the doctor tells me they are very sorry, but I should have stayed far away from Cox Bazar because it seems I may have unfortunately contracted Sugandese nuts.

I’m mostly wondering if anyone has good essays/philosophy books/etc on this topic or their own developed opinions. I’ve been having a hard time balancing my feelings about individual freedom and personal morality/state protection concerning stopping people from committing suicide. I think even the way that is phrased sounds strange, as if killing yourself is an amoral act (in some sense it has been viewed this way for a lot of at least western history). I understand the kind desire to protect people, even if that means stopping them from acting against themself (mandatory seatbelt use, for example), but if your life is truly miserable, at what point is it unkind to make someone continue. During depressive periods, I have often come close to killing myself, and I think my friends expect me to feel happy that I didn’t when I’m between periods, but as a non-religious person I imagine that if I had died, I would feel nothing, so what’s the internally motivated tragedy. I suppose my current analysis for myself is that if I expect the remainder of my life to be even 50/50 of happy/misery, then it’s neutral to kill myself when thinking only of internal factors. My further frustration then comes from looking to external factors and expecting to fulfill this selfish wish of others to continue living even if my life is below the 50/50 boundary (or the generally inapplicable opinions that happy moments are somehow more impactful than miserable moments). I certainly think that former commitments like children preclude this irritation at external factors weighing on these decisions, but I dislike the idea that friends and family opinions should make someone do something even as minor as choosing a career, let alone continue an unpleasant life. It also seems like the acceptability of discourse around physically sick people with physical misery having assisted suicide, but not mentally sick people with mental misery having this same assistance is a continuation of unfair beliefs around the invalidity of mental difficulty when compared to the physical. I also feel frustration at a likely answer to this post which is that my personal proximity to suicidal thoughts somehow invalidates the objectiveness of my opinions, that being suicidal inherently means you’re not thinking properly, and that all of your related thoughts can be discredited simply as the delusions of a sick mind. I’m not even sure these sentences support my feelings, but I thought I would ramble for a bit and see if anyone has similar commentary.","#26839 content warning: s**cide

My birth mother is violent and mentally ill, yet refused to seek medical attention. She has found gratification in physically hurting me, since I was 4 years old. A few extended relatives told me the woman was “sick in the head” while I was a child. After leaving at 18, I managed to escape the abuse.
I don’t use social media much, and have my privacy settings on high. I have wrote on Facebook in support of domestic violence and child abuse help organizations as far back as 3 years ago, when I was 18. Since Facebook allows users to set up philanthropy fundraisers on their birthdays, I’ve been consistently doing so and adding a short paragraph about my childhood experiences along with information about the organization. I also write in support of National DV Awareness month (October) and National Child Abuse Prevention Month (April). My ideal career is in social work and public health.
In this past year, I have learned that someone has been relaying my sparse Facebook posts to my birth mother. She has been stalking me by reaching out to my friends. The woman has also told them she will find me and kill me. I was able to pursue a restraining order based on the threat. However, at the last court date, my birth mother stated that she wants to counter-sue me with a restraining order. I can only imagine she is enraged that after 15 years of child abuse and torture, I have found the courage to speak up and ‘embarrass’ her status.

2310142682388099,"#25839 As a MIT alumni, I want to share my story about dating someone with depression. Let’s call him Jake for anonymity’s sake.
We met during CPW. At the time, I was dating a boy who was going to UCLA next year. I’ve been with him my senior year, and I was hurt knowing that we might separate. On the one hand, I was excited that I could finally have some freedom (I was raised in a strict, sheltered east Asian family). On the other hand, my boyfriend was the one person I depended on. My everything.
It was at that point that I met Jake. I can’t exactly remember how I met him, but I remember he cracked some jokes and just had me crackling all day. We spent hours in Simmons talking about our lives, and by 3 am he asked me if I was dating someone. I told him the truth, and he just wink at me and said, “lucky guy.”
A few days before my freshman year started, I was crying because my boyfriend told me that he wanted to break up. While I was curled up in a ball in Stata, Jake found me and asked if I was okay. After I explained the situation, he walked me to my dorm and spent all night listening to my feelings. I’ve never met a boy that was so caring to me. He never judged me and never tried to fix my problems for me. He just sat there, listening.
After a few months, I went to a party at Jake’s frat. I never danced before, but he guided me while I was stumbling around like a fool. He held my hand the whole time, and I guess I caught feelings at that moment. After the party, we walked back to his dorm room, and we spent the first night together. I guess you can say we were officially together now.
My parents prohibited me from dating, yet I couldn’t help but adore him. He was a huge restaurant and movie geek, and would take me to the finest places and watch the most “sophisticated” movies. I thought they were all pretentious at the time, but who wouldn’t want to spend two hours with your loved one in the dark? He always told me how much he loved me and wrote me these cringy (but amazingly sweet) poems. I really felt like I was a Disney princess.
At that point, I couldn’t help myself. I told my parents that I loved Jake, and that I would be dating him no matter what they thought of him. As expected, my parents yelled at me, but I was so passionately in love that it didn’t matter. I knew my parents would come around to loving him if they met him.
I walked to his room and knocked on the door to tell him we could start dating. When he opened the door, his face was red and he was crying. I asked what was wrong, but he wouldn’t respond. He just sat there like a sad puppy.
After a few hours, he told me he had been struggling with depression for about a year. He described it as having to drag an anchor around at all times, and not having time to breathe. I cried along with him. I never knew he was going through so much.
We continued dating for the next few months, both with its ups and downs. Some nights, he would get angry at me for the smallest things. Other nights, he would cry and tell me that he wasn’t good enough for me. But for the most part, it was nice. We shared so many happy moments together, and I would never trade those moments for anything.
One night, I heard a loud knock on my dorm room. I opened the door and found two police officers, and asked if I knew Jake. I replied cautiously before they told me that he attempted suicide a few hours ago. He was in the ER now, and would be transferred back to his home for the rest of the school year. I broke down and begged to see him, but they wouldn’t let me. They just told me that Jake wanted them to reassure me that he would be fine, and that he still loved me.
My parents forced me to break up with him. I lost all motivation to do anything, and pretty soon my grades plummeted. I had many fights with my parents over the phone, until I eventually cut ties with them for a year. I was a mess, and Jake was nowhere to be seen for the next few years. I was so angry at him; angry that he tore apart my life, angry that I never got to explore and enjoy my freedom as a freshman, angry that my heart and stolen and I might never love again. I had to visit a therapist multiple times over the next year to deal with my anxiety attacks.
A few years later, things eventually got better. During my senior summer, I interned at a company in Boston. Someone walked up to me and asked if I remembered him. I looked up and dropped everything I was doing. It was Jake, wearing nice business attire and with a cute smile. He sat next to me during the meeting, and we spent the next hour staring at each other awkwardly.
When the meeting was over, he took me to an empty hallway and started apologizing for all that happened. He told me he sought professional help for depression and began making positive changes in his life. At first I was speechless, but we decided to date a few times. Eventually, I told him that I really missed him, and that I would be willing to try again if he was. After watching La La Land with him, we had our first kiss in years in the parking garage of that movie theater.
In a couple months, I will be marrying that boy. I’m still freaking out that I’ll be a cuffed woman soon, but I can say for a fact that there is no one I’d rather spend my life with. The relationship will be filled with ups and downs, but I know that he’ll make me a happy woman, and I’ll try to make him the happiest guy in the world.
I’ve spent the last few days writing my experiences so that I could share them with you. Whether you are dating someone with depression or other mental issues, or are dealing with these issues yourself, please remember that it WILL get better!
I am not saying you shouldn’t leave them if they are abusive or toxic (you absolutely should). But I am saying that people dealing with depression often have a beautiful core inside of them. These people know how painful things can be, and will never leave your side, no matter how bleak your situation may be.
Please support your friends and family if they are going through these battles, for they will thank you for an eternity. And, in turn, they will shower you with more affection, care, love, and happiness than you can handle! Love is all about sacrifice, and helping one another turn tears into smiles.
Anyways, thanks for listening to my story. Good luck with your finals, and please wish me luck as I go on the alter and say, “I do.”","#25839 As a MIT alumni, I want to share my story about dating someone with depression. Let’s call him Jake for anonymity’s sake.
We met during CPW. At the time, I was dating a boy who was going to UCLA next year. I’ve been with him my senior year, and I was hurt knowing that we might separate. On the one hand, I was excited that I could finally have some freedom (I was raised in a strict, sheltered east Asian family). On the other hand, my boyfriend was the one person I depended on. My everything.
It was at that point that I met Jake. I can’t exactly remember how I met him, but I remember he cracked some jokes and just had me crackling all day. We spent hours in Simmons talking about our lives, and by 3 am he asked me if I was dating someone. I told him the truth, and he just wink at me and said, “lucky guy.”
A few days before my freshman year started, I was crying because my boyfriend told me that he wanted to break up. While I was curled up in a ball in Stata, Jake found me and asked if I was okay. After I explained the situation, he walked me to my dorm and spent all night listening to my feelings. I’ve never met a boy that was so caring to me. He never judged me and never tried to fix my problems for me. He just sat there, listening.
After a few months, I went to a party at Jake’s frat. I never danced before, but he guided me while I was stumbling around like a fool. He held my hand the whole time, and I guess I caught feelings at that moment. After the party, we walked back to his dorm room, and we spent the first night together. I guess you can say we were officially together now.
My parents prohibited me from dating, yet I couldn’t help but adore him. He was a huge restaurant and movie geek, and would take me to the finest places and watch the most “sophisticated” movies. I thought they were all pretentious at the time, but who wouldn’t want to spend two hours with your loved one in the dark? He always told me how much he loved me and wrote me these cringy (but amazingly sweet) poems. I really felt like I was a Disney princess.
At that point, I couldn’t help myself. I told my parents that I loved Jake, and that I would be dating him no matter what they thought of him. As expected, my parents yelled at me, but I was so passionately in love that it didn’t matter. I knew my parents would come around to loving him if they met him.

2285674544834913,"#24385 A story that began on February 5 of last year in The Tech may have died an untimely death as the lead story of last week's Tech Talk, to the eternal detriment of all food consumers on the MIT campus.
Under the headline ""Ashdown Dining Hall to Close December 20"" the Institute, in typically bloodless press office prose pronounced the death of the only worthwhile a la carte dining facility on campus. Every person quoted spoke in crisp phrases.
There was, apparently, no room for the comments of any regular user of the dining hall who would now be deprived of-a civil place in which to eat lunch or dinner. The massive cafeterias of Morss Hall (in Walker) or Lobdell (in the student center) are nice places in which to have a meal in the same sense that a tour of duty with the Marines in Vietnam is a ""nice"" tour of a small Asian country.
Instead, we are treated to the same things we heard last year; consideration of cost deficits remodelling, efficient use of facilities, and so forth,
Balderdash!
Here, once more, it is time for the members of the MIT community to strike a blow for human scale against the unyielding Institute. If all decisions were made here strictly on the basis of losses, then undergraduate education could well have been done away with a decade ago. To borrow words used in the joint Student Affairs-Housing and Dining statement: ""It is with great reluctance that we make this decision; but with *all* factors considered, *including* the present and projected economic situation we face, we see no other responsible alternative other than"" closing down undergraduate education and sticking to sponsored research. We make a profit on that.
I added the emphasis in the statement to highlight my contention that all factors were not considered, and that the word 'including' might more properly be ""excluding all factors, save...""
For that matter, the School of Humanities and Social Science is an inordinate drain on the central funding mechanism of MIT. Yet it is only occasionally that people talk of getting rid of it. There are other examples, small parts Of MIT which are not, in and of themselves self-sufficient.
I bring them up,. not to propose that they too be eliminated, but simply to point out that, when the Institute as a whole decides that some facet of its activities is worth continuing, it does so, usually without regard to is status as a ""profit center"". Why should the dining halls be any exception?
Housing and dining have, in recent years, been given the order, to ""pay for themselves"", and efforts have been made to refine bookkeeping sufficiently to make this possible. It would be unfair not to mention the fact that the administration holds such accountability as an eventual goal for all facets of this academic operation. It would be ridiculous to expect that any small segment which loses money would then be eliminated.
It is however, exceedingly difficult to quantify such things as peace, quiet, seemingly higher quality food, a pleasant view, a low ceiling and soft lighting. Such things do not easily form coefficients in complex demand-profit curves, so they are most often left out when ""all factors"" are considered.
But it is not as if there wasn't a similar facility left: about 1 mile away, faculty members can still go to the Faculty Club, to which some administration members are driven from their offices in building three. If you don't mind much higher prices, a much stuffier atmosphere, and a much longer walk from any area of consequence save Sloan, you can eat there. If you do mind, you'll do what you've been told to do, eat in Walker or Lobdell.
Ashdown dining hall would have been closed this December anyway, while that part of Ashdown was remodelled. Some at least hoped that it would be re-opened afterwards, until the recent announcement. A group lead by Carolyn Ann Ross of the Ashdown House Committee is trying to reverse the decision by applying public pressure. The tactic was successful once before, but that may be more bad news than good for the crusaders; they are likely to meet a ""we tried it before and it didn't work"" attitude on the part of the people who have to decide these things.
But it is worth noting that, as of February 5 of last year, the decision to close the hall appeared final. The news story of that date in The Tech even mentioned a possible future location for some Ashdown employees; the soon to be re-opened Burton dining hall (which was never re-opened). By March 9, 1100 names had been gathered on petitions (Ashdown has 400 people in it) and a campus-wide campaign was carried on to increase business at the dining hall (the article of that date mentions a second floor dining hall in Ashdown which has yet to have been mentioned in this year's discussions).
The fight was apparently successful, as were such innovationis as specialty nights, reported in The Tech of May 11. The decision was made to continue operating Ashdown. People promptly forgot about specialty nights or efforts to introduce new people to the pleasures of dining there. Half of the undergraduates who were here then are now gone, and the effort, which should have been continual and low key, must now become sudden and hysterical, if it is to have any chance of success.
As is true of so many other issues which catch fire in the public mind, the Ashdown dining hall is threatened with extinction due to apathy. It is probably unrealistic to ask any group with a 25% annual turnover to maintain consistent, long term approaches to any issue. But the issue of human surroundings at a time of day (mealtime) in which they have been proven to be critical by medical science should not be so cavalierly treated. If each incoming class, and all new faculty and graduate students, were told, or better yet shown, what it is like to eat there, then such threats would not continue to be made.","#24385 A story that began on February 5 of last year in The Tech may have died an untimely death as the lead story of last week's Tech Talk, to the eternal detriment of all food consumers on the MIT campus.

Enter the bus and nod to the driver three times, while winking your LEFT eye on the second nod. The driver is then going to whisper in your ear the secret password. It is absolutely essential that you remember this word as you will not gain access otherwise. Get off the saferide on the first stop and proceed directly to Quality Mart. Ask for Omar. Lean over the counter and whisper the secret word to Omar. He’s going to lead you to the back of Quality Mart and into the stockroom. At the back of the stockroom is a secret passage that leads to every frat in Boston. Obviously it’s underground and shit so charge up your phone before all this and have the flashlight on the ready. Walk down the passage and take one of the forks in the road. Doesn’t matter which one, just don’t double back because then you’ll fall into a GDI trap and that’s not chill. After a little walking you should come to a ladder constructed entirely out of beer cans. The brand of beer cans indicates which frat you have arrived at. Delts is Keystone, Skullhouse is Guinness, Sigma Chi is Bud Light, and Chi Phi is Natty. Not sure about the other frats. Climb up the ladder. You should now be inside a small room with a hobbit sized door. Look up the founding year of the fraternity chapter that you are visiting. Knock out the year on the door. So if it’s 1860, knock once, eight times, six times, then pause. The door will open and you will proceed into another room. Now wait for music to play.

Also, i know its common for girls to have uneven labias, but it still scares me that my partner would judge me, especially during oral.

2227509993984702,"#22078 I'm an international student and I wanted to share something very important about my home with this community. I can only do it anonymously otherwise I could get into legal trouble in MY OWN COUNTRY.
Growing up, being Tamil or being able to speak Tamil was seen as this horribly backwards thing to be. Indian people in Singapore are taught to hate themselves, are taught to become anglophones and more Chinese. It took years for me to break that kind of conditioning, and I'm proud of my people, especially those of us in the diaspora who still keep our language and traditions alive.
Too many times, 'that's cos we are the majority' is used to justify racist structures and actions. During a conversation with someone, they said this about how Mandarin should be the default or national language in Singapore and it's because 'they are the majority.'
In schools everywhere in Singapore, female teachers outnumber male teachers usually in the ratio of 5 to 1. And yet, there is always a male toilet that accompanies a female toilet in equivalent ratios. If the principle of catering to the majority holds, why isn't there only one male toilet for every 5 female toilets?
The person I was having this conversation with went silent. Because he knows that if he had very few toilets, he would make a ruckus about it in school and expect equal treatment despite lesser numbers.
That's one glaring way that privilege works for the privileged. They are catered to even when they are NOT the majority in any given context. And when they ask for equal treatment despite not being the majority, they are ensured that it will be taken seriously. But in circumstances where women and minorities etc are numerically the majority, we are not catered to. Even when privileged people are the minority, they are always catered to.
""But we are the majority"" only works for the privileged. The principle is never enforced uniformly in all circumstances. It is an argument that propagates inequality and discrimination in the name of capitalist efficiency.","#22078 I'm an international student and I wanted to share something very important about my home with this community.

So back to the whole smoking thing.
I think the biggest issue with what I said on the last post was:
""I wish smoking culture was still popular""
Maybe it is for the best that smoking isn't popular.
I get it isn't pleasant to most people..... BUT
To the people that kept saying shit like
""HER DER smok bad"" & ""Smoke is cancer"" & ""Get cancer on your own time""
I literally fucking said I wish there was a smoking admissible lounge for people that don't wanna freeze when they want a smoke.
Y'all act like the smokers on campus are gonna tie you down and blow smoke into your face.
Here's an idea: if there was a smoke lounge on campus, and you don't like smoke, how about you don't go in? Sounds pretty simple right?
Its not like I was calling for all of MIT to become smoking permitted.
Next time you comment some stupid shit imma go cough into your food

2050209871714716,"#17222 President Rafael Sloan responds to letter on Nazis
October, 1941
To the Editors,
Last week, a group of graduate students in MIT’s Department of Political Science penned a thoughtful open letter to me in The Tech about MIT’s engagements with the Nazi government in Germany. I have responded to the students directly but want to share my reply with your readers as well.
Following the brutal killing of Mr. High Profile Figure from Big Media Company earlier this month [and NOT the Holocaust, only unimportant people are dying in that], I asked Associate Provost Richard Lester, who oversees MIT’s international activities, to reassess our Institute-level engagements with entities of Nazi Germany. On Oct. 15, Professor Lester wrote to the faculty to inform them of his charge and ask for their input.
I appreciate the students’ concerns and understand their desire for action. However, given the importance of this process, I feel it would be inappropriate for me to make any decision or comment further until Professor Lester has completed his review and formulated a recommendation; God-forbid we compromise our highly lucrative buissn---err I mean highly productive educational and research collaborations--- with the Nazis without carefully exploring alternative ways to save face. At any rate, I intend to share his recommendation with the full MIT community after I have reviewed it.
Sincerely,
L. Rafael Sloan

Some context for this little satire: Saudi Regime, at direction of Prince Bin Salman, have lead indiscriminate bombing of Yemen for years now, causing worlds worst humanitarian disaster . MIT is very cozy with the regime, and has been for a while now. Then the prince orders brutal murder of a high-profile WPO journalist, and Oh No! Now we need to ""express grace concern"" and ""assess our relationship"". Grad students pen a letter asking MIT to cut ties and Reif responds with BS. I copied his response and replaced saudis with nazis (and added a few things). Changed Rafael Reif to Rafael Sloan since Alfred P. Sloan did business with Nazis","#17222 President Rafael Sloan responds to letter on Nazis

1963965117005859,"#14195 tldr; MIT Dining is a sham
Let's math MIT Dining to see if it is really worth it:
Say we get the 125 Meals + $290 dining dollars for a semester, for a total of $1950 for the semester.
Subtract the $290 assuming its basically cash, and we are left with:
125 meals for the price of $1660
For an average meal price of $13.28
If you want to pay for a meal at the door, you pay:
$14 for dinner (WOW savings of $0.72)
$11.25 for Lunch/Brunch (You just lost $2.03)
$8.25 for Breakfast (You lost $5.03)
So lets say you really want to make your meal plan worth it;
That means you must always go to dinner and only dinner. Let's say there's 16 weeks in the semester. That gives you 7 * 16 = 112 dinners for total savings of $80.64! wow, but then the other 13 meals you must use on lunch, which brings you a loss of $26.39.
All in all, this means in total you can save $54.25 on dining by signing up for a meal plan; but only if you go to every possible possible dinner, never eat breakfast, and use all of your meal swipes. If you miss a single dinner, that means you just lost at least $2.03 of possible savings from the meal plan.
Just remember, every time you eat breakfast with a meal swipe, MIT Dining is effectively stealing $3-5 dollars from you with their sham meal plan.","#14195 tldr; MIT Dining is a sham

1793875667348139,"#13667 As a moderate conservative, it’s been difficult for me to understand one part of the transgender movement. I’m posting on here because I’m looking for real answers since I know that a lot of MIT students support the movement— please don’t hate on me if I come off the wrong way. I promise I don’t mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(
Anyways, on with the question. I’m confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don’t necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in “female” activities such as putting on make up, liking “girlish” colors, and “speaking” like a girl? I guess what I’m asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?
If this is the case, then why can’t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) “him” a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming “transgender (in this sense)?” Isn’t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?
TLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain “gender,” even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn’t exist according to the left? Please don’t hate on me :(","#13667 As a moderate conservative, it’s been difficult for me to understand one part of the transgender movement.

If this is the case, then why can’t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) “him” a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming “transgender (in this sense)?” Isn’t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?
TLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain “gender,” even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn’t exist according to the left? Please don’t hate on me :(",,1527135120,,,14,3,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1793875667348139&id=462508190484900,

1671403616262012,"#12000 Someone please correct me and let me know where I'm misinformed. I know I'm missing something.
I feel like some parts of MIT's AI startup movement are misguided (and that MIT isn't doing a proper job of teaching ML and educating aspiring AI entrepreneurs). I say this for 2 reasons:
1. MIT AI/Machine Learning courses are either very theoretical (focusing on the math / nitty-gritty of certain ML algorithms) or too broad (they try to cover a ton of ML concepts / essentially take you on a journey through how ML progressed). In other words, their primary focus is on understanding models, not building them.
2. Building your own ML models is another challenge in and of itself, but to (over)simplify things, it boils down down compiling a large (possibly unwieldy) dataset and then applying matrix multiplications, loss functions, and backpropping. Compiling the dataset takes a huge amount of time (not to mention figuring out how to label them), and then tinkering a model to ""do well"" on whatever the initial goal was, then going back and forth between the two, takes even longer. Not to mention that much of it is resource intensive and will have to be done on AWS.
MIT clearly believes in AI / Machine Learning (just based on the number of new courses and the IBM partnership). My concern is that MIT may be overemphasizing the wrong parts, focusing more on the ML models rather than the process of building everything (dataset and model) from scratch. (This could go into a whole other debate on whether its student's jobs to learn these things for themselves / whether internships should cover those aspects, but I'd like to focus more on how MIT is approaching ML).
Basically, TLDR, MIT's way of teaching machine learning provides a good foundation for building 1-shot machine learning tools, not machine learning startups.","#12000 Someone please correct me and let me know where I'm misinformed. I know I'm missing something.

1648611148541259,"#11275 @my earlier confession about being jealous of people who were lonely but then come here, find a group, and blossom:
Constantly looking for a group like this ruins the magic. It's not supposed to be something you look for--following your path, it just happens. It's kind of like how in a lot of stories, a protagonist finds they're magical and then finds a world that loves them. By the finale, they grow in power, and personally.

1637818126287228,"#10956 tl;dr: i'm a relatively affluent person and boy oh boy does money = privilege, this is something i try to be constantly aware of because it has made such a huge difference in my life
I wanted to throw my two cents into the discussion about wealth and privilege, so here goes. My family is relatively affluent, and we live in a pretty well-off town. Both my parents grew up poor, so they've worked to make me aware of how much of a difference money can make. In some sense I've always been aware of this privilege - that I've grown up not having to worry about food and medical treatment and etc. I knew that even when family members were dealing with alcoholism and cancer and depression, we could afford to get them the help they needed. Even though it was awful to see people you love struggle with these problems, it felt like something was being done to help. So I've known that my family and I are extremely lucky to have the access to what we need.
But I wasn't really confronted with this until I came here. I was surrounded by people who were all roughly in the same income bracket as me for most of my pre-college life. After coming to MIT, I think I fully realized that class privilege isn't about the conspicuous consumerism or using the money you have at all. It's all the other things that come as a consequence of just having money - the security in times of trouble and access to resources because you're in the right places.
Because the town I lived in is pretty well-off, we had a really solid public school system - my family never felt the need to pay for private schools or tutoring, because between my own initiative and the support I had in these schools, I got a pretty solid education. I was able to take advanced classes and do research and intern at a company before coming here just by virtue of being in that town and meeting people there. I ASE'd a bunch of subjects because I had had the chance to take higher level math and science classes in high school, which is an opportunity other people just didn't have. Even if I didn't bribe my way into those classes and worked hard to test into them, the reason they were there at all is because my school was funded by the taxes that people in my town pay. I didn't have to pay a dime once I was in the school system, but just by being able to afford to live in that town I got a leg up on people who couldn't and thus ended up in worse schools. I've met people here who didn't have a fraction of the access to education that I did, and it really made me step back and think about the tremendous privilege that I have and how much easier it was for me to get here. That's not to say it was easy at all - but it definitely was easier.
MIT really made me realize that class privilege is not as much about the money itself as it is about the access and support that just having money immediately gets you. Nobody is saying that because you're wealthy your life is rainbows and sunshine (although it might be, and in that case I'm really happy for you). Your problems aren't less valid that anyone else's. It's just also important for you to realize that other people have problems you just have never had to deal with and cannot probably begin to comprehend. And you've had access to things and support that other people haven't had even though they probably really could have used it, and that's huge. Just think about it a little bit.","#10956 tl;dr: i'm a relatively affluent person and boy oh boy does money = privilege, this is something i try to be constantly aware of because it has made such a huge difference in my life

I want to study what I've always wanted to (physics, what got me into this school), and I want to avoid a bad socioeconomic situation afterwards so I'm studying for a CS minor.
I feel like this is pretty unhealthy for me in its current form. A physics major is already pretty hard, and I'm pretty sure I have to study more than most other people to do decently well. Then doing the CS minor on top of that drains most free time I otherwise have left over (I also had no CS background at all, and worse math than most, so those CS assignments also probably take me longer). So then I'm missing out on other things I enjoy doing with my free time. But I feel like if I don't get the CS minor and a physics undergrad degree doesn't cut it (in case grad school doesn't work out, which might be the case right?), then a physics undergrad degree is meh and I might have not gotten as much of an improvement in my socioeconomic situation as I'd have wanted. So I feel like I absolutely have to study CS if I want to get a physics degree.
The alternative is to ditch the physics degree, study something more lucrative (probs CS), and take some physics classes I want to.

On a similar note, though not directly related to the previous incident: There is a significant amount of people at MIT, especially in my residence hall, who have beliefs/practices that are scientifically inaccurate and possibly harmful. Our classes cannot openly debunk these beliefs because that would be considered offensive.

1335626033173107,"#9191 When I was a freshman I converted to Christianity from being raised in an atheist household. The biggest question I get now as a senior is why? Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.","#9191 When I was a freshman I converted to Christianity from being raised in an atheist household. The biggest question I get now as a senior is why? Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.",,1487998920,,,16,16,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1335626033173107&id=462508190484900,

I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’
So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.
‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.
Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.
‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

1196469913755387,"#8369 I've been feeling very depressed lately - eating like crap, not talking to my friends, skipping classes, coming home late, sleeping too much or too little, failing tests and psets, surfing youtube rather than doing psets. I wake up with anxiety every single day. I have days when I spend the time I should be psetting curled up in my room or in a nearby bathroom having an anxiety attack, holding my head and waiting for the dark voices to go away. Sometimes they don’t.
People don’t seem to notice this change. Why would they? I haven’t made any friends close enough for me to open up to to care or notice. It’s my fault I’m so alone. Yet, why do I feel so sad about this self-made situation. Maybe I’m just weak. In terms of workload, I have it super easy this semester. I’ve only had one or two quizzes this week for midterms, but my other friends have 3 or 4 midterms and psets together. They must be more stressed out than I am, but they’re handling it better than me. I’m probably just weak.
I know that people keep telling me to seek out friends because ""you can't get through MIT alone,"" but talking to people just seems so entirely worthless. Even if I do talk to people, it'll just feel like I'm being a nuisance to them; they won't really care. People only say that they care, but after you bother them too much, you just become an annoyance.
I already tried going to MIT mental health, but I got the same vibe from them. When I told the psychiatrist that I was feeling sad, they pried for more information and I felt very attacked. Can’t they just listen to what I have to say without getting so worked up about it? I understand that it’s their job to make sure that I’m not in any “immediate danger,” but at the same time, couldn’t they see me as a person rather than as just another patient they need to hurry up and fix? They didn’t even seem to be interested in what I was saying when I was happy - listening and nodding with the same bored and distant eyes as all the other people who said they “cared.” They don’t really care; It’s just their job. When my hour is up, they would just tell me to wrap it up and ask for another appointment time. If I can't even open up to the psychiatrist without being judged and possibly sent to a mental hospital for the slightest misstep, who else can I trust? After a few weeks, I just feigned happiness and never went back again to mental health again.
Now I’m more depressed than ever. It’s so hard just getting through every single day. Who am I living for? What am I living for? What’s the point anymore? I don’t know what to do. I can’t ask MIT Mental Health help because they’ll just send me to a mental hospital. I can’t talk to friends because they honestly don’t care and will just find my constant depression annoying. I can’t tell my family because I don’t want them to worry. I’m not doing well with any of my psets, tests, or obligations because I can’t concentrate. But at this rate, it’s so hard to just keep living through every single day with a fake mask of happiness.

I can’t tell my family because I don’t want them to worry. I’m not doing well with any of my psets, tests, or obligations because I can’t concentrate. But at this rate, it’s so hard to just keep living through every single day with a fake mask of happiness.

This year both times it happened I just got really annoyed, even though I know they mean well. I've accepted that I'm a C student, because MIT forced me to. I recently switched to the flexible version of my major with a HASS minor so I wouldn't have to take hard classes anymore, but even now on 36 units of easy classes, even with all that extra time to commit to individual classes and the lack of sleep deprivation, I'm still getting that email. But it's still so much better than how it used to be, when I tried to be a normal MIT student taking a normal 48 units while taking all the classes required for my major. I worked my ass off, got lots of help, went to office hours, went to S3, never slept, went to Mental Health and got a prescription for Adderall, generally did everything right and then some, and still barely passed my classes, assuming you count a D as passing. It sucked. Maybe if I went back to that lifestyle on my lighter courseload I could be an A-B student, but I was so fucking miserable, and it's not worth it. If a low GPA is the price for my sanity, I'll take it. My blood pressure dropped almost 30 points from near-hypertension levels back to pre-MIT levels when I made that transition. I refuse to go back.
But I still have to meet with my professor to talk about how to fix my apparently problematic grades, which was a shock because I was enjoying that class.

This professor is so much nicer than other professors too. I'm so used to being treated with contempt by professors, but he treats me with respect and it's such a shock. I don't know what to tell him. Usually the message I get from these meetings is, ""just get higher scores."" Guess I just have to grin and bear it like always and flounder my way to graduation.

1070490503019996,"#6480 So I just read that the US may start forcing women to register for the draft and I think that's fucked up on many levels. The idea is that if women want the same rights as men then we should serve along side men. And I realize that the draft is rarely used but this is isn't even about equal rights and using that as the reason behind this is fucked up. If it was really about equality, then the military officials deciding this and pushing for this bill should not be mostly men. And frankly if the military can't even ensure the safety of women in combat now, specifically when it comes to sexual assault, what do you think is going to happen if women are forced to be there?
I am personally very anti-war and think no one should have to register for the draft regardless of sex. But if this is really going to be about equality, then I want the same men that think it is right to send women off to kill others and/or die to give me and other women the rights we actually deserve. Rights like full access to birth control, feminine products (without a pink tax), equal pay, and the right to decide what to do with my own body without the influence of government.
I get that a lot of people may agree with this bill and I'm not ""anti-America"" for disagreeing with it. I just think it's wrong to use women's rights and equality as an excuse to force people to serve the military, especially when the military is not the only (or often even the best way) to serve your country. These men don't actually care about women's rights. If they did they would have done more about sexual assault in the military and other women's rights issues in the US.
I'm just irritated now. It's late, I'm tired, and what I read just made me really angry so I probably did not develop my points as well as I should have or even used the most proper and/or accurate terms, so I guess you can say this was more of an angry rant.

I wish the best for your future and hope you fulfill all your dreams. You work really hard, and you definitely deserve it! No matter who you end up with in the future, I hope she realizes how lucky she is to have a guy like you.

I am quite honestly astonished by the sheer number of Bernie Sanders supporters at MIT and other elite institutions of higher learning across the U.S.
While I actually agree whole-heartedly with him on social and foreign policy issues, his fiscal and economic policies are as absurdist as a 1972 Luis Buñuel movie. Not only would a 15 dollar minimum wage instituted at a federal level decrease overall social welfare but it would actually hurt the poorest people of the country the most. There would be much fewer jobs for American workers and more jobs outsourced. People that are willing to work for less aren't able to. Of course certain cities/ states can viably maintain a 15 dollar minimum wage which is why it has been instituted at those levels. Then Sanders goes on to say that he would be in support of regulation that would make it illegal for American companies to outsource jobs and would like to see an end to most of our free trade agreements with China, NAFTA, etc. This is almost comedic in stupidity. If that regulation was actually passed, companies would simply move out of the U.S which would hurt the economy even more. Tapping into the global economic ecosystem is crucial for American success in the future and it is a backwards view to isolate ourselves. Finally, at the crux of Sander's economic policy is the villainizing of the rich. It's clear through all the various debates that he views rich people as greedy, evil people that provide no value to society. This simplified and narrow-minded view is ignorant. Yes the previous recession was in part caused by ""greedy"" leaders of banks but from a higher perspective the actual problem was caused by mis-aligned incentives on the part of the federal reserve and U.S government. Additionally, the finance industry is largely responsible for the innovation and growth of the American economy throughout much of the past decade, which Sanders clearly doesn't know/ acknowledge.
No Bernie, I refuse to ""feel the bern"", and I would highly encourage fellow MIT students to consider the consequences of these fiscal/ economic policies thoroughly before blindly hopping aboard the hype train.

Secondly, I find it hard to keep a conversation going most of the times. It feels like people doesn't care what I'm passionate about/I don't care what the people I'm meeting are passionate about. This might also be a big reason why I de so antisocial, but how can I break out of this circle?

First of all, I am an international student who grew up in a vastly different culture from most of the students here. It's literally two opposite corners of the globe, so it is always hard to relate to people based on some key elements from this culture.
Secondly, I find it hard to keep a conversation going most of the times. It feels like people doesn't care what I'm passionate about/I don't care what the people I'm meeting are passionate about. This might also be a big reason why I de so antisocial, but how can I break out of this circle?
Finally, due to spending most of my high school life after some very special extracurricular activity, I am mote used to being in a clique than being in a friend circle that's more of a sparse graph. But it takes time to build a clique anywhere and in the meantime I am feeling awkward and lonely.

Now, a lot of the talk I am exposed to seems so abstract. I hear more about a passionate ""we will overcome this"" mindset than I hear about what metrics are being used.

Instead of focusing on limiting and scolding others for certain actions, focus on asking for a logical, desirable change.

All are welcome and hopefully we'll get a good gender mix of runners along with some spectators to cheer them on. It will be a great way to relieve stress. Please spread the word and like and share this with your friends, dorms, frats, sororities, clubs, teams, etc. Start a tradition of doing the run within your group, or start your own goal of doing 8 of 8 naked runs.
(FAQ: Why down the Infinite and back and not a loop? If someone wants to stop, they don't have to finish a loop. Those enjoying it can even go out and back again. What do I wear when I show up? Clothes or a towel. Where do I leave the clothes? In Lobby 7, since that's where the run ends. Why doesn't the run go outside? Safety in the cold weather - even UC Berkeley stays inside. What about cameras? Spectators and runners alike will probably bring their cameras to document the run and we can't stop them. Do I have to be totally naked?

976487032420344,"#3020 I am an Evangelical Christian here on campus. I don't hide what I am, and most of my friends here are agnostic or atheist. We all get along just fine. One question I frequently get asked, I would like to address here. The question is, ""why doesn't your church do things to be more fun, accept birth control, cohabitation, female priests, and other serious changes"". People usually add to that how those changes would bring back young people in droves. Lets talk about fun, church is not meant to be fun. Church is about learning how to live your life, and to keep you on the right path. Lectures here are not always fun, but you still go, because you understand their need. People who leave church because it's not, ""fun"", are like people who leave lectures here they paid for, they missed the entire point. Next, accepting homosexuality, cohabitation, female priests, etc, etc. The reason we do not do these things is because all of these things are against the core doctrines of our church. We follow the lessons of the bible, the bible strictly forbids cohabitation and birth control violates the spirit of being open to life. We also forbid them because we empathize putting others before yourself, this includes creating stable working families, where you put the needs of the other members before yourself, even if it is at your own detriment. Cohabitation encourages you to seek your own pleasure, above the needs of others. (There is also plenty of psychological research showing this.) Some people have argued against this from a survival standpoint saying we should do it anyway just to get new members. We are not a popularity contest. Jesus when asked if he was king replied, ""My Kingdom is not of this world"". We are not a worldly crowd, nor do we want to be. And even if we were, the majority of students here at MIT would not show up anyway. You would all know that we were changing the doctrines in a cynical attempt to bring you. Did you know there are many new protestant sects that accept homosexuality, female priests, cohabitation, and other things?

Either aboutsomehow ""accidentally"" getting back with you once again and putting myself into reliving the pain, or a combination of that and the last few non verbal encounters we had. I'll get over it eventually, they're just subconscious remnants of trauma. I just really hope you learned for your next relationship. Never treat someone how you treated me. Your last message makes me hope you did learn. You are an amazing person and even though I don't love you anymore I do remember why I loved you and I hope you can share that with someone else.
I want to say the following because there's a chance it can help someone else: No relationship is worth emotional/physical abuse. Emotional abuse is very real, because there was no physical damage I used to think it wasn't real/wasn't really affecting me. But it was. When I see him now I get so scared, but not for my physical safety. I never thought this was possible, a conditioned fear reaction without (much) physical cause. I don't care how much you love them, how good things are usually, how much it feels like you can never love someone as much as you love them. Do not let them hold you hostage by your love. If they threaten to break up with you over something absurd in order to control you, let them. Call theyre bluff, youll see its almost always a bluff. If they threaten to break up with you, let them and say goodbye. Dont take them back, especially not if this happens repeatedly. If they say, ""if you really loved me then [insert something they want you to do/not do]"", realize there's a big chance they are trying to manipulate/control you. Never let someone try to invalidate your emotions or tell you they are wrong/not real. If you repeatedly argue with them about the same things, and its always them attacking you and you defending yourself, its probably not going to change. You'll make up, things will seem fine, and it will happen again. Leave them. Even if it seems like you can't survive without them, you can, you will adapt and grow and you will be so much stronger and happier because of it. Losing them will open room up in your life for so much more. Never let fear control you.
If you are ever confused or unsure about how you are being treated in a relationship, please ask for help, go to VPR. They can help you figure out what's going on, which is usually really difficult if you are blinded by love. Emotional abuse is so hard to deal with alone because even if you know youre in the right, having to always defend yourself really does affect you in subtle ways and gives them control over you. Literally the person I talked to at VPR helped me immensely, even though no one has ever been able to help me work through something before in my life. You are strong, you will adapt, and you are worth so much more.

I still remember but what I can see clearly now is all of the abuse you put me through. That was some text book emotional abuse and it wasn't OK and I will never stay with someone who does even a fraction of what you used to do. That's why its so easy now to forget you. After I stopped caring about you I was alone and it was beautiful. To not have to fucking answer to anyone. And then I met someone and I fell in love again. Its different and so much better.

But to me, when someone makes a joke where the punchline is based on the western born stereotype that ""all asians look the same"" , well that brings up a lot of pain, especially if this person is well respected in a community that students of color are trying to thrive in.

969152453153802,"#2571 Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that this has nothing to do whatsoever with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This confession only has to do with two events I have experienced in the one semester I have been at MIT. I do not have a firm stance on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. I feel that the complexities of the issue are beyond the scope of my knowledge and experiences. What I do understand a little better, though, is hate, and I am very much anti-hatred. I attribute my strong anti-hatred stance to my grandfather who amazingly escaped Germany during the Holocaust as a child. The rest of his family:mother, father, and older brother, though, could not escape and did not survive. Needless to say, this deeply impacted my grandfather. The most important way he influenced me was through his intolerance for hatred. He taught me that hatred is ignorant and could have a devastating impact if not kept in check. This leads me to two events that, although not unheard of, are very alarming and should not be occurring- especially at MIT. The first occurred a couple weeks ago during office hours. I sat down in an empty chair next to a girl whom I had not seen before. This girl was wearing a hijab. Naturally, I have no idea if she is Palestinian, simply anti-Israel, or what her views are, and quite frankly I could not care less. She's a student at MIT, like me, and she is here to learn, like me. She looked at me, and I smiled (even though the socially-awkward side of me panicked as it does whenever someone looks at me and I had to confirm to myself that my breath didn't smell and that I did shower that day). I did notice, though, that her eyes lingered on the Star of David necklace I was wearing. Without hesitation, she picked up her notes and sat away from me. Obviously, I do not know what she was thinking and maybe she simply could see better further back in the classroom. I did not let this bother me, though if you're reading this, I am sorry if I offended you. The second, more concerning event, happened before the ""Israeli Impunity and the Palestinian Reality"" event. Although I do not agree with the angry and perhaps hateful undertones of this event, I do support free speech and I am happy that students and faculty who are anti-Israel feel safe enough to voice their opinions. I was walking down the Infinite prior to the event; I saw a massive line of people and had no idea what was going on. I asked someone what was going on, and she said ""A talk by Dr. Chomsky on the injustices from bloodthirsty Jews"". As she was saying this, the person she was with looked at my Star of David necklace and then proceeded to say something in Arabic to the woman I was speaking with. The woman then proceeded to loudly and angrily exclaim that I was ""venomous"" and a ""disgusting murderer"" to which others in line turned to us. I was so alarmed and taken aback that I quickly walked away. I even felt unsafe to walk back to my dorm alone later that evening. I do not know whether these people were MIT affiliated or not. I do not feel that students should be censored in their political beliefs. I feel censorship can create an environment that could be deemed unsafe to students. What I do believe, though, is that people should be weary of when their beliefs transform into hatred. I am not Israeli nor do I have a strong opinion on the situation, and I have not even been to Israel. Yet, due to my cultural and religious identity I was verbally attacked in front of many people. I have not been here for a full semester, yet I have already experienced this hatred. I feel unsafe to wear my Star of David necklace that I have been wearing for years let alone discuss this matter. We are all students- most is not all of whom have played no role in this conflict. All student groups should be tolerant of each other's beliefs even if there is disagreement. But no student should be subject to personal discrimination and no student should ever feel that their safety is threatened.","#2571 Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that this has nothing to do whatsoever with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This confession only has to do with two events I have experienced in the one semester I have been at MIT. I do not have a firm stance on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. I feel that the complexities of the issue are beyond the scope of my knowledge and experiences. What I do understand a little better, though, is hate, and I am very much anti-hatred. I attribute my strong anti-hatred stance to my grandfather who amazingly escaped Germany during the Holocaust as a child. The rest of his family:mother, father, and older brother, though, could not escape and did not survive. Needless to say, this deeply impacted my grandfather. The most important way he influenced me was through his intolerance for hatred. He taught me that hatred is ignorant and could have a devastating impact if not kept in check. This leads me to two events that, although not unheard of, are very alarming and should not be occurring- especially at MIT. The first occurred a couple weeks ago during office hours.

As a black non-American male who can actually dance, [as confirmed by my awards from dancing competitions] lets say I am actually frustrated by the type of girls I meet on the dance floor at MIT and around the Boston area. (Am 21+) . In my experience, I have met two types of girls.
1) The white, asian [including Indians of course], or black girl who is insecure or probably lacks exposure and refuses to dance with any black male. I make this conclusion because I see them dancing with another non-black male immediately after they turn down dancing with me. And repeat this disgusting behaviour throughout the party. I actually try to watch to see if I can prove myself wrong. Unfortunately, they prove me right every fucking time.
2) The ones who understand that a party is just a party and are willing to dance with anyone who can prove that they got moves.
Now, if you belong to group two, clap for yourself. Those who belong to group one however, should check themselves or their prejudices. Do you prefer dancing with non-black males to black males? Why?...
Do you understand that this behaviour could have a racist undertone? If you act this way because of what the media perpetuates, check yourself. Relax and have fun. Parties are supposed to be fun and not a space to bring whatever racist tendencies you have.
This post about discrimination also rings true for black women and online dating as well... but I won't delve into that for sake of brevity.
I feel like this part of the world is overly obsessed with unfounded assumptions about races to the point where communities at schools like MIT and other schools around the Boston area are so segmented. Lets chill and have fun people, We share more in common than our differences to be honest...

Not only are you distracting the other students in the class, you're being extremely rude to the professor. I pay a lot of money to sit in this class, it'd be awesome if you would shut the fuck up so I can hear what's going on. And if I ask you nicely to be quiet don't give me attitude back.

I have a huge social anxiety problem. And it's cause I hate myself and have no confidence. It’s probably why I never reach out to people for new friends or jobs.

We've all struggled here-okay *most* of us for one reason or another. We've all questioned ourselves and the Institute for what it *claims* to offer.
For me personally, I've constantly struggled here. My freshman year I chalked it up to not having a strong technical background. I didn't take AP Chem or higher level biology and those were the classes I got my fifth week flags in. As I was getting adjusted to just how rigorous (read: how absolutely fucking ridiculous) MiT work can be, sophomore year came. Once again I was flogged by work. Now in my major I chalked up to never seeing the material before, but sophomore year I realized, just like most people realize sophomore year, that something is up. MIT
may be ranked one of the greatest schools in the world but you wouldn't be able to tell that by the quality of the teaching.
See, every homework assignment I've EVER gotten at MiT. I've had to google, I had to Wikipedia, I had to Internet. Every assignment required me to learn what ought to have been taught in class. The problems were never really elucidated by lecture. They just show where the hole is, and the homework throws you in.
After a few years here I've gotten tired of it. When I see professors say ""you'll learn through the Pset"" I realize that's often a poor guise to cover their poor teaching. And as much as people may learn from really hard problems only loosely connected to the lecture, I don't. Relying on excessively hard problems to most of the value to your education is one size fits all solutions that fails to take into account people's differing learning styles or the fulfillment of the undergraduate experience. I learn from teachers. Not problems. Even if I did, with the constant rush to the next assignment or the next problem you don't have the time to dissect a problem for its moral of the story. Let's be honest, you don't even have time to sleep here.
Now say what you will about MiT needing to be ""rigorous"" or hard, but in reality, I've spent years here just googling. Now googling Isn't inherently a bad thing , but when I find other universities with far better notes and lectures than MiT-constantly-I have my doubts about the Institute.
I have my doubts when I see all of us struggling to get by, when I see suicide after suicide, and realize we are some of the smartest people in the world. Yet, collectively we struggle here. Yes, we came here for a challenge and yes struggling is a great way to grow, but clearly the struggle here is an order of magnitude off.
Great researchers don't always make for great teachers. And yes, the idea of having the best in the world teach you sounds great...but I realize being taught by the best *teachers* in the world would be a helluva lot better.
I'm just writing this because I feel others can relate and this sentiment should be voiced

In this instance, the train by default goes straight. Changing the track makes him responsible for the single death, and therefore a murderer. Is he responsible for the five deaths if he does nothing? If yes, then he is responsible for all deaths you could prevent but do nothing about. If not, he has no obligation to pull it.
I think most here would say you should pull the lever. However, if you aren't trying to save as many lives as you can every second of every day when you have the possibility to save them, then you are in some sense responsible for all of those lives. Ignorance of how you can save someone is not an excuse, since you can always use time when you can't save someone to gather more information so that you can.
I'm on the side where I think we should try to save as many people as possible. I also know that I'm not doing as much as I can to save people. Doing this burdens me with extreme guilt, because I recognize that I'm responsible for a large number of deaths.

I completely understand and respect why someone wouldn't want to deal with the guilt of blood on their hands.

My dad finished high-school and never went to college, my mom didn't even finish high-school. They had to work 12+ hour shifts 6 or 7 days a week at dead end jobs to support us. I escaped reality by throwing myself into academics and got here as a result. My friends here have been supportive of me but there have been times where we had to deal with different sets of thinking. For example, both my parents smoke, my older brothers also smoke, and they all smoke in the house we live in. When I casually mentioned to my friends that they wouldn't like my house since it smells of heavy tobacco they flipped out and asked how any parent could subject their child to it and told me that I was an ""abuse victim"". It took a very long, patient, explanation and I want to share it because I feel that a lot of the middle class and rich students here do not get it, quite frankly. Most poor people smoke and are now the majority of smokers. One big reason is poor people don't get weekends, or vacations to a beach house, or yacht club. For many of them, a cigarette is the only break they get. And some people say, well what about 20 - 40 years from now? When you are barely scrapping enough money to pay rent and put food on the table today, 20 years from now is as far from your mind as it can be. And about smoking in front of me, first of all, second hand smoke isn't nearly as dangerous as smoking itself, and if you read the studies, (I have quite thoroughly.) they admit you have to be around it in an extremely concentrated manner for decades to have any tangible effect. What I had, a few family members who would have a couple smokes after dinner at the table, does not nearly qualify. Also, my parents were both raised by chain smoking parents themselves, so this to them is very normal. What I ask my fellow students is to please stop rushing to judge poor people for not following middle class and wealthy people in lock step, money makes a massive difference. And please don't call me an ""abuse victim"".

949064431829271,"#1825 Earlier I posted a confession about the level of sexual acts I have witnessed here. I want to anonymously address two comments there which addressed good points.
One asked if I felt that a womans value only came from her sexual history and willingness. The other asked why I was talking about the women and not the men involved. The reason I choose to address women is because I feel this is an issue that harms women the most. To the women here I will be completely honest with you. The harsh reality is, in our society you have very little power as a whole. Men hold most of it. Sex is one of the few areas you can say no to definitively. Power is the ability to say no. The second you give that up, you lose power. This is not going to change anytime soon. Men have sex for very different reasons then you do. Women for the most part see it as the beginning of developing an emotional bond. Men simply see it as a recreational activity. Sex may be an act of love and fun for women, but for men it's an act of power, control, recreation, and in some negative circumstances, violence. Men tend to get into relationships and marriage for regular guaranteed sex, not so much the emotional bonds that women get into relationships for.
To answer the question of the value of women, no a woman's intrinsic human value is not based on sexual history. Unfortunately for men, her value as a partner in a relationship is. And guilt tripping men trying to tell them to change millions of years of gut instinct is not going to help. What I am recommending to women is to wait for a committed relationship. You have to make your partner wait, treat you well, and value you, and work for you physically. People value scarcity. And the key to dealing with the power dynamic of sex is to get the guy to commit then get sex. That way even though you have submitted and relinquished sex, he has submitted and relinquished some of his freedom. That way even though you have given up the sexual power, he still respects you and treats you well.","#1825 Earlier I posted a confession about the level of sexual acts I have witnessed here.

My new advisor replied that he's honestly excited to get to know me better. He said he was going to work with me to figure out how to survive MIT. He didn't care that my GPA is bad. This unexpected support and acceptance made me sit down and sob for the first time in months.
I didn't know why I was crying at first, but then I realized it was just the relief that someone was finally NOT judging me for my grades. Everyone who has seen my academic record just assumes things about me, because after all, how can you get D's and still deserve to be at MIT?
I realized that this is the first time in two years that I've felt like more than the sum of my GPA and academic achievements. That's how I know this is such a fucked up place. Somehow, the faculty and staff have lost humanity amidst psets and exams and grades. I even forgot that I'm more than a sum of my academic achievements. It's easy to say to each other ""oh, you are more than your grades,"" but when your professors and advisor and faculty and mentors don't echo the same message, that's when things get bad.

Like, I never ever said ""thank you"" to anyone until middle school, when people started pointing out how rude I was to not say certain things.

But then I just kept hearing these recurring stories, like ""blah blah my parents knew this one guy and that's how I started research"" or ""blah blah my teacher got me started in this"" or even ""blah blah oh yeah my relative works in [insert college] admissions, so I'm not worried about getting in"" blah blah blah. Oh and also “blah blah I found out about his camp because one of my friends went here.” Lol I felt incredibly odd for being the only person who found camps by googling stuff with the keywords “science” and “financial assistance.” I don't think those people even realize how privileged they are. To have even the smallest bit of guidance from somebody, or a nudge onto a path of success, or the tiniest bit of assurance that your life will turn out fine even if you do one thing wrong-- those are HUGE privileges.

I probably never would have applied to MIT.

I know, coz I'm a grad student who did undergrads elsewhere.
One thought I really feel like sharing: if you keep failing at something,it doesn't mean you're a failure. It just means that you're supposed to succeed at something else. A lot of us are bad at accepting failure.

Firstly, a Prof at MIT said that if you're at MIT, you must be doing something right. Also, if we step out of MIT, we can clearly see how much better our education here is compared to other schools. I know, coz I'm a grad student who did undergrads elsewhere.
One thought I really feel like sharing: if you keep failing at something,it doesn't mean you're a failure. It just means that you're supposed to succeed at something else. A lot of us are bad at accepting failure.

756960334373016,"#1389 So..the article ""Drunk female guests are the gravest threat to Fraternities"" has sparked a lot of conversation and anger. And so has the response ""Fraternities are their own worst enemies, not Drunk Girls.""
I'm going to be brutally honest. I'm a girl, and I actually agreed with a lot of the things that Bill Frezza was talking about. He went a little overboard on points, but in light of the LCA incident and the frat ban now and last year, he was probably a bit worked up about everything and said things he probably regrets.
Outside of MIT is a different story, but within our school, I believe that a lot of frats here really do try to follow the basic rules. Yeah, they're going to have alcohol, but when it comes to the serious situations of rape and sexual assault, the fraternity as a whole is not going to encourage and support those kinds of behavior. I think what Frezza was trying to say was that fraternities have control over themselves, but not their guests--and there's a larger consequence if something happens to a guest that is a female (which is a whole different topic). There's a potential for a lot of misunderstandings that could blow up into things that could bring down the frat.
I'm not talking about sexual assault or rape cases. That's the fault of the person who committed those actions (but still not the fraternity as a whole). I'm talking about people who are intoxicated who make poor decisions because of their state and end up hurting themselves and blaming the frat. Most of us have been to a frat party. There's a lot of people to watch out for, and a situation like that is really hard to prevent. And unfortunately, the situation is a lot worse if that accident happens to a girl rather than a guy. Politically that's just how it is.
And let's be honest, the response article was a dramatic, exaggeration of the LCA situation. ""an intoxicated girl 'danced out' a frat house window, thereby ruining the party. I'm pretty sure the brothers, all the other frats, and the rest of campus took that more seriously than a party buzzkill.","#1389 So..the article ""Drunk female guests are the gravest threat to Fraternities"" has sparked a lot of conversation and anger.

""If I may add, I personally felt no humanistic compassion from none of the politician speakers: they referred to THEM and US, the bad guys and the good guys (not just bad, they actually used some very negative adjectives: knock-off jihadis, perverse, etc etc). There was too much hate in their speech at times. The sad thing about politicians as I keep noticing from one country to another, is that they don't seem to care much about humanity. their values are very close to only one community, not caring about the other communities- I mean, that's not a bad thing, as long as you remind your community that there is a bigger picture as well, and that all humans are worthy of your love. We are all one. This whole world, the people everywhere are all good, kind people. Some are misled, instead of hating them and giving way to hate, why don't we start trying to fix them. Teaching them to love. Not hating them back and judging them and not giving them second chances.
It's not Boston ONE. It's humans ONE (humans in Boston in our case)- it was the love for people that made those brave Bostonians reach out and help during that catastrophe, it was not the fact that they had to help the Bostonians. Tell me, did those brave Boston men and women ask ""Oh, where are you from? So we know if we should help you or not?"". and it is sad that people at power don't understand it- or even worse, they don't care as long as it helps them politically. Saying things that do not inspire love or care for other people, they don't understand that the majority might just be carried away in those feeling of hate towards some other miserable person that for who-knows-what reasons has been brainwashed and misled into the hate and destruction. Our enemies are Hate and Destruction. Not people. I totally agree with both #440 and #437. And I'm glad looking at some many people think this way. I'm really glad.
