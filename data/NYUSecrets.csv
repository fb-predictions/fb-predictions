Some professors, not all, make hurtful comments such as """"the bad ones will be weeded out,"""" and a standard is being created that allows for excellence to be determined by the performance of others. The 'elite' are defined as such only because they excel when compared to students that may not have access to the same resources and privileges. Industrial, political, and business related problems aren't scaled to be solved by the 'elite,' so it's not right that they treat others as inferior just because they have a higher GPA. Yes, GPA is an established standard, and an indicator of excellence, but it isn't entirely indicative of someone's capability when the method to gain a good GPA is flawed. A good GPA at NYU isn't the same as a good GPA at an Ivy League, or at a community college, so this internal cycle of judgement only hurts us in the end.
Growing up, we're always been told to not compare ourselves to others; to be the best we can be. But we ARE being compared, so what can we do? What's my point? If you have a good GPA, you should be proud of it, but don't look down on others who don't. It isn't difficult to treat individuals, who you know nothing about, with decency and respect. And if you have a low GPA due to circumstances out of your control, I believe you have other strengths, and I don't believe you should be ostracized. We all have something to offer to the world and we need to be focusing on that, now more than ever.

If you have any questions or want to come forward and share your story either confidentially or on record, please either reach out to the page, to me personally via messenger (I’ll be actively checking my DM requests) or via email at clt366@nyu.edu, or contact Li Cohen at liyakira9410@gmail.com or 561-685-6155 (personal cell). There is power in numbers, and I truly believe that this piece can catalyze positive changes that this university desperately needs.
Also, if you’re the person who sent something to me regarding this topic in the fall of 2017 (I reached out to title IX on your behalf), please contact me immediately. Nothing is wrong, I just have an idea.
Thank you all so much, and have a great school year! 💜",,1568048528,,,122,0,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2738684852833688&id=455528264482703,

First and foremost, congratulations to our Class of 2019 Grads!!!! We hope it’s been an incredibly rewarding journey, and we wish everyone the best as they embark on a new journey, whether it be grad school, a job, or otherwise.
Since it’s the summer, submissions tend to go down. Owing to the difficulty of such scarcity, we won’t be posting over the summer. We hope to open up to submissions the week before Fall 2019 Welcome Week, and start posting around Welcome Week.
Have a great summer, and take sometime to mentally refresh when you can. I’m sure many will be starting internships or classes, and it’ll be key to catch up with yourself before you begin that part of your year.
Best,

2498614396840736,"10,927: ""When a girl says that she's too busy to hang out with you, have you ever wondered whether she's uninterested in you or actually busy that week with psets and exams? Based on extensive research, interviews with my fellow female friends, and personal experience (I'm a girl), I have determined a 100% foolproof way to tell. Ready to hear the secret? Here it is: she is interested but actually busy IF AND ONLY IF she tells you that she's busy but suggests an alternate day to hang out with you. Otherwise, if she just leaves her response as a simple ""Sorry, I'm busy"" without a follow-up, she's not interested!
Even worse is when she gives you the second response but you then ask her, ""So when are you free?"" This puts her in an extremely uncomfortable situation because it doesn't give her the option to decline unless she says something like ""Oh sorry, I'm never free,"" which she obviously would want to avoid because it's impolite. So then she panics and says, “uhh, I’m not sure,” to avoid explicitly telling you that she doesn’t want to hang out with you, ever. And you are bewildered by her response and think that women are confusing.
To summarize, here is A Handy Guide on How to Ask a Girl Out, Yet Save Face for Both of You If She Isn’t Interested:
Ask the girl the following: “Hey, I was wondering if you’d be free this ______ at ___ pm to get dinner with me?” Be extremely specific! Don’t say, “Are you free in the next decade?” or worse yet, “When are you free?”. It’s much better to say, “Are you free this Saturday at 6:30pm?”.
Option A: She says some variation of “yes”. Wow, that was easy!
Option B: She says, “Sorry, I have five psets and two exams that week, but how about _____? Does that work for you?” Congratulations, she was actually busy but is interested in you! You also gave her the option to decide on a date that works for her, you gentleman you!
Option C: She says, “I’m a bit busy then. Sorry, I don’t think I’ll be able to make it.” Oof, sorry my dude, she wasn’t into you. Do not, under any circumstances, suggest another day. This is because if she was truly interested, SHE’D suggest another date. Wish her the best with her work and go your separate ways.
For everyone out there who’s afraid of rejection (ie, everyone), this is the perfect method, because by suggesting a very specific date and time, there’s a huge chance that she will actually be busy. This means that her response of, “Sorry, I’m busy” will be genuine, but now it gives HER the power to decide on a further course of action. Essentially, you’ve turned the tables and now she’s the one asking you out! Thus, if she suggests another time, congratulations, a girl just asked you out on a date! If she doesn’t, that’s equivalent to her never having asked you out in the first place, so everything has stayed the same and you have lost nothing.
I hope this helped, and good luck!""","10,927: ""When a girl says that she's too busy to hang out with you, have you ever wondered whether she's uninterested in you or actually busy that week with psets and exams?

The past few weeks she's been doing things that make me really uncomfortable, but I tried to make excuses for her and just hope that she would stop on her own.

I made a list of everything she was doing that bothered me, and after looking at it all written down it seemed insane to me that I hadn't distanced myself from her already. Here's part of that list:
- holding hands/linking arms when walking down the street (all the time)
- touching my hair (without asking and for no particular reason)
- touching my face (without asking and for no particular reason)
- touching my knee/leg (for no discernible reason)
- hugging more often and longer than normal (3-5 minute every single time we say bye to each other, whether it be in between classes or if I'm going home)
- refers to me as her “soulmate”
- extremely clingy/needy/borderline codependent (she doesn't really have any other friends)
- says that if we were opposite genders we’d “make a good couple”
- refers to going out to eat/grabbing coffee as a “date”

Morally, I know it's wrong to long after someone already in a relationship, but I can't shake this feeling like I could be letting something important go. In my mind, he is confused and afraid. But my friends tell me he's just a jerk who is playing with my emotions and doing his girlfriend wrong.

I thought perhaps he was confused about his relationship, but I don't know if it's just me dreaming up scenarios about how we could be together in my head. Sometimes I feel I should reach out and tell him how I feel, in my mind there is a slight possibility he may feel the same way. But I also want to respect someone else's relationship. Morally, I know it's wrong to long after someone already in a relationship, but I can't shake this feeling like I could be letting something important go. In my mind, he is confused and afraid. But my friends tell me he's just a jerk who is playing with my emotions and doing his girlfriend wrong. I think if he knew how I felt it may be different but my friends and therapist tell me he already knows how I feel and is playing with my emotions. Should I forget about this all together? I don't know what to do with all these emotions.""",,1558057020,,,17,11,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2495371643831678&id=455528264482703,

One thing that I’ve struggled with ever since I moved here is connecting with gay domestic students. I feel like gay Americans don’t really like me as much because they think that I’m trying to be “masc” or “straight-acting.” But I think Americans don’t realise that LGBTQ+ international students (particularly from non-Western countries) can come from a place where gay people don’t have the same level of rights as gay people in the US.
I’m trying to get rid of my internalised homophobia after growing up in a conservative country for so long, but it’s hard to feel comfortable openly expressing my sexuality when being gay is criminalised back home. I’m openly gay in the US and I love all of my friends here, but everytime I go home to see my family during break, I’m forced to move back into my closet. LGBTQ+ international students are often faced with having to choose between living our true selves and safety. And when you grow up in a place where the gay rights movement is non-existent and where you can be jailed just for being gay, it makes sense why a lot of us would pick the latter.
And it’s hard for me to accept myself when I feel like I’m being rejected by other gay people. When we’re rejected by straight people, it’s easy for us to think that straight people will never get it. But when it’s from someone that’s of your own kind, that’s hard.
So if you’re an international student who is gay, I just hope you know that there are people who are like you and are going through similar things.

I hear that's a big part of NYU - probably any college. Trying to decide if I should go to a smaller school. Admissions people say there are a million clubs to join and easy to find community. Please talk me into or out of NYU. Thanks.""
R15: ""i’m not sure if i can submit something but i’ll try! i was recently accepted into tisch and it’s my dream school! i even went to the summer program and had the time of my life and grew so much as an artist, even if it was super stressful and challenging.
i want to attend so bad but i was offered almost nothing when it came to financial aid. my family can definitely afford the tuition, and we wouldn’t be taking out loans, but it’s just not ideal. i feel so selfish telling my parents that i want to go solely because... i just want to. i’ve considered the effects towards my education, our financial situation, my career path, and more. nyu is a really good school for my major, and i really want to attend. my parents have pushed me to go to the school i want, and my mother for nyu specifically, but i still feel awful about it. is it selfish to ask my parents to spend this much money on tuition, even if we can afford it?
i’ve gotten way better offers from other schools, but none of those schools are as good as nyu (to me) or as known. i worked really hard to be a good student academically in high school, so going to nyu makes me feel like my studying was actually worth it all these years.
can any current students help me sort my thoughts on my situation? to you, is nyu worth it?""
R16: ""Incoming freshman here. Are there any half asian half straight guys here? I wanna date one so bad""
R17: ""This is less of a secret and more trying to get some more insight into the school. I was accepted as a transfer student to Tandon recently for the Biomolecular Science major. If I were to attend, I'd probably need loans and be in major debt. I attend my current CUNY for free. Is the debt worth it? Is Tandon worth it?""
R18: ""NYU's really gonna tote that the incoming freshman class is representative of 88 countries? If so, I'd love for them to include the median income of these applicants. I don't think it get mentioned enough - the poorer the country you meet an NYU student from, the higher likelihood that their family benefits off of lax labor practices and in some very real cases slavery and servitude.""
R19: ""Does any of the resident hall and the lecture buildings have butt shower/spray? Please make this Asian boy and his butt feel safe""
R20: ""Every time I overhear NYU tour guides giving tours to prospective students I'm always annoyed at how much they mischaracterize the NYU experience. I love NYU, but I feel like they always say things that make it seem way different than it is. I know they're trying to sell the school to kids and parents, but I hear them say things about how everyone gathers as a community in Kimmel and that's just not true. Like I study there sometimes and I'll go to Peet's with a friend, but it's not a center of community life. I've also overheard the things they say in Bobst and in the Park and again I just hear them say things that I would never say to describe our school. There isn't an NYU community and I feel like it's deceptive to give people that impression. I know they sometimes talk about ""microcommunities"" but I also think that isn't a clear way to talk about NYU. I just think they should be more straightforward about the benefits AND difficulties of going NYU.

I hear that's a big part of NYU - probably any college. Trying to decide if I should go to a smaller school. Admissions people say there are a million clubs to join and easy to find community. Please talk me into or out of NYU. Thanks.""
R15: ""i’m not sure if i can submit something but i’ll try! i was recently accepted into tisch and it’s my dream school! i even went to the summer program and had the time of my life and grew so much as an artist, even if it was super stressful and challenging.
i want to attend so bad but i was offered almost nothing when it came to financial aid. my family can definitely afford the tuition, and we wouldn’t be taking out loans, but it’s just not ideal. i feel so selfish telling my parents that i want to go solely because... i just want to. i’ve considered the effects towards my education, our financial situation, my career path, and more. nyu is a really good school for my major, and i really want to attend. my parents have pushed me to go to the school i want, and my mother for nyu specifically, but i still feel awful about it. is it selfish to ask my parents to spend this much money on tuition, even if we can afford it?
i’ve gotten way better offers from other schools, but none of those schools are as good as nyu (to me) or as known. i worked really hard to be a good student academically in high school, so going to nyu makes me feel like my studying was actually worth it all these years.
can any current students help me sort my thoughts on my situation? to you, is nyu worth it?""
R16: ""Incoming freshman here. Are there any half asian half straight guys here? I wanna date one so bad""
R17: ""This is less of a secret and more trying to get some more insight into the school. I was accepted as a transfer student to Tandon recently for the Biomolecular Science major. If I were to attend, I'd probably need loans and be in major debt. I attend my current CUNY for free. Is the debt worth it? Is Tandon worth it?""
R18: ""NYU's really gonna tote that the incoming freshman class is representative of 88 countries? If so, I'd love for them to include the median income of these applicants. I don't think it get mentioned enough - the poorer the country you meet an NYU student from, the higher likelihood that their family benefits off of lax labor practices and in some very real cases slavery and servitude.""
R19: ""Does any of the resident hall and the lecture buildings have butt shower/spray? Please make this Asian boy and his butt feel safe""
R20: ""Every time I overhear NYU tour guides giving tours to prospective students I'm always annoyed at how much they mischaracterize the NYU experience. I love NYU, but I feel like they always say things that make it seem way different than it is. I know they're trying to sell the school to kids and parents, but I hear them say things about how everyone gathers as a community in Kimmel and that's just not true. Like I study there sometimes and I'll go to Peet's with a friend, but it's not a center of community life. I've also overheard the things they say in Bobst and in the Park and again I just hear them say things that I would never say to describe our school. There isn't an NYU community and I feel like it's deceptive to give people that impression. I know they sometimes talk about ""microcommunities"" but I also think that isn't a clear way to talk about NYU. I just think they should be more straightforward about the benefits AND difficulties of going NYU.

Hello everyone.
So today, we posted an NYU Secret, in which the submitter expressed their battle with depression and suicidal thoughts because they had lost a great amount of money due to circumstances largely out of their control. In the comments section, many were quick to belittle the submitter because it seems they had a lot of money before they lost most of it.
This is an incredibly toxic (not to mention dangerous) mentality to approach such a post. Thoughts of suicide and mental health are not unique to certain income classes. Yes, the submitter seems to have a lot of money. That does not make the mental struggle they have expressed and experience any less real. In a similar way, morality is not financially gated when it comes to mental health. If someone expresses suicidal thoughts to you in person, are you going to look at their bank account to check if they're rich before you express sympathy and concern?
We have been deleting comments and banning especially problematic users for the belittling and lack of sympathy they've expressed. In the meanwhile, I hope those who felt their situation wasn't worth sympathy take some time to reflect on your beliefs, and think about what causes you're defending when you express such beliefs.
Best,

For example, I was taught that from a religious standpoint, meddling in a relationship is completely unacceptable and gets you allll the bad points, so to speak. I was taught (and reminded) never to say anything that could break up a relationship and that I could never know all of the parts of a relationship.
This included a note that if someone does something for you, you owe them. Ie. If someone provides a home and food and etc it's a sin and moral defect to not be loyal and repay them.
But that sounds like some bs added by some misogynistic culture to keep women from leaving abusive relationships. (Was told I'm going to the bad place for that comment)
I just spent the last week doing a whole lot of meddling and it's not the first time. A friend is in a long term toxic/abusive relationship and I want her to get out before she marries the guy or gets knocked up and it all gets much worse. I once helped break up an engaged couple (he was hitting her and blackmailing her with nudes). I forced a friend to admit that she cheated on her boyfriend with his friend and another guy (that I knew about). Stuff like that.
I'm not trying to start drama or gain anything or hurt anyone. It's not about stuff that makes me salty, it's about things that check off abusive relationship checklists or put someone's health at risk. I know that some of the time the victim may be gaining financially from the relationship but even then isn't physical and sexual safety and preventing children from being potentially born into that environment more important than an even slightly higher material standard of living? Giving the benefit of the doubt, shouldn't the person being toxic have a chance to get help, reform and potentially have a better relationship as well?
I feel like I did the right thing but the religious guilt and fear is *really* bothering me and I'm not even that religious.
I agree with the base ideas but stuff like this messes with my head and I can't get it out because I grew up very religious.","10,846: I have a lot of trouble figuring out where my religion (and religion in general) fit into modern life.

Today -- for example -- I'm finishing up my taxes, and I have to review the 1099 from my brokerage...and it sounds so stupid, but it's honestly hard to look at; all the emotions from 2018 come flooding back.

R13: Want to know what makes NYU stand out for me?
The Big Dicks.
Allow me to explain a bit. So I transferred in after one year from a community college in Queens and, without a doubt, the average dick size at NYU is bigger. Call me crazy but that's been my experience here. Keep in mind that this conclusion isn't a result of any scientific statistical analysis or anything. (I'm a novice at stats). There could be a number of factors influencing why this has been the case for me. But whatever the reason, all I know is that, on average, the guys at NYU have had way bigger dicks than the guys at my community college. Since I am pretty promiscuous I think my sample size is pretty good. In the three years I've been here, N > 30. At my CC, the sample wasn't quite as large but still pretty big. I also have quite a few friends at Columbia and they've reported that the dicks there are on the smaller-to-average side when we discuss sizes. The same is true at Fordham, though those dicks are reportedly still bigger than Columbia. My friends tell me they're shocked when I tell them about my experience. Our measuring procedures aren't exactly scientific, I know, but hear me out.
At least for me there has only been two guys from my community college who had dicks as big as the guys at NYU. I guess I haven't measured them with a ruler or anything, but I have a pretty good eye for size and definitely pay extra attention to every guy's size. I've been mentally keeping track of dick sizes since I was in high school. It's just this sort of weird, funny ranking system I have in my head. And I've been able to ballpark dick sizes to the nearest 1/8th of an inch. I didn't think much of it all until last year when I realized that the dicks at NYU were way bigger than the dicks from my past.
Anyway back to the analysis. So it seems like every guy I've slept with here, and I've slept with quite a few*, seems to be at least .7 - 1.2 inches bigger than the non-NYU dicks I've experienced. If you know anything about mean penis sizes this is quite significant. The interquartile range for dicks here has been like 6.5 - 7.1 inches erect in my experience, which is INSANE. The average size of an erect human penis in the country is 5.17 inches long, erect. I found NYU dicks tend to be girthier as well. So not only are they longer they are thicker as well, which has made for some great experiences in bed, though I must say that big dicks DON'T always predict great sex. But it does help when you know how to use that thing, just saying.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. Could it be that the guys that I'm attracted to are attractive to me because they are so confident--confidence that stems from the fact that they have a big dick? If this is the case then maybe I'm unconsciously pre-selecting guys (confident guys) who are more likely to have big dicks, thus biasing my sample as a convenience sample. The thing is, though, that at my CC I was also attracted to confident guys and the dicks simply weren't as big as they are here.
Or maybe it's the fact that NYU just attracts students with bigger dicks in general? Students who are in shape, confident (and really smart of course). I think the downtown NYC lifestyle really pressures people to either conform to this lifestyle or attracts people who already align with it. And that guys who end up here are the type of guys who have big dicks, i.e. guys who are happier and more secure and more likely to be all about their appearance and style stemming from their big dick energy and confidence, perhaps? Idk. Lots of conjecture here. But I just want to try to make sense of this with a working theory.
I think big dick guys just want to live in NYC, are attracted to the lifestyle and decide to matriculate here. Whatever the reason, dicks here have been bigger in my experience than at my community college and beyond. And, according to reports from a big sample of my friends at other schools, NYU dicks are bigger than dicks at Columbia too.","MISCELLANEOUS SUNDAY:

Over spring break she slept over for the entire week and since I couldn’t give my dog away for that whole time he stayed in my apartment. I left my girlfriend at my apartment for a day so I could visit my grandmother. When I came back my dog was dead. Just like that. My girlfriend came home later from shopping and acted completely surprised and consoled me. At first I didn’t think anything of it but today it occurred to me that she killed him. Is this crazy?

My high school counselor was the only person I had, in regards to helping me with my FAFSA, college apps, etc. She told me I had 1 extra day to fill out my papers and submit my financial aid documents. I trusted her and submitted the day she told me. I got a letter from NYU saying I was getting no financial aid, and the scholarship I had received wouldn’t even cover 1/3 of the tuition. I’m poor. My parents had offered to take out a loan for me to go to my “dream school”. I couldn’t let them do that, so I applied to marymount manhattan, got in, and started my new college path. I hated it.

I graduated with a physics degree, because I love science and I think it’s important. But I didn’t get it to go off and exclusively do physics research or teach: I stuck with physics because it gave me the opportunity to learn how to problem solve.
I also have a minor in English, because I love to read and it’s important to learn that events can have multiple interpretations, and seeing things from different perspectives allow you to empathize with others better.
I took a Gallatin class, and I learned how to approach problems with different and unique perspectives. I learned how to talk about one type of subject matter in a completely unexpected format.

Hello everyone,
We at NYU Secrets stand in solidarity with those who are suffering, either directly or indirectly, from the actions which were carried out by the white supremacist on a Friday morning in Christchurch, New Zealand. What happened in New Zealand was nothing short of horrifying, and is reflective of dangerous trends existing not only in New Zealand, or the US but in fact the entire world.
We also stand in solidarity with Muslims all around the world who continue to face injustices every day. What happened in New Zealand was not a unique event. For example, millions of Uighurs, a minority group in China which follows Islam, is being held in what can only be described as concentration camps in northwestern Xinjiang by the Chinese government. Standing in solidarity today does not merely limit us to New Zealand, but also has an implicit global focus.
We also recognize the impact that the radical networks which have existed on the internet led to the supremacist committing acts of terror on Thursday. He did not come up with his beliefs independently. Websites such as 4chan and 8chan provide online echo chambers for beliefs such as white supremacy and Islamophobia to perpetuate and become normalized within the community. He reflects the darkest sides of meme culture, and we hope those who feel themselves versed in internet or meme culture take the time to also look inward, and see how memes ultimately can lead to real-world beliefs and actions.
To everyone, I hope this weekend, at the very least, can serve as a moment of healing.

Yes, most high school relationships don't work out. But guess what? Most college relationships don't work out either. We are at an age where it's undeniably hard to have a healthy, lasting relationship because we're all trying to figure ourselves out simultaneously. At this age, long distance may be the best thing to ever happen to your relationship—giving you the space to explore independently and have unconditional support from someone you love all the while.
My advice is that love is a feeling, but also a choice. If you want to choose your high school sweetheart then choose them. Don't let cynical people (there will be many) convince you otherwise. But also don't stop choosing them. Love is sunshine and rainbows for the most part, but it can also be some pretty rough seas. Be willing to put in the work to better yourself (including making lots of friends and learning to become self-secure) and better the way you love. ♡

He’s an army vet, was in the Marine Corp for 7yrs after the attack on 9/11. He’s got such a big heart and a lonely stag life. Maybe I’m just worried about hurting him, or only being so enamored for the fact that he’s a broken soul like me. Or maybe it’s because he reminds me so much of my father (not to get too Freudian, but #DaddyIssues). I just don’t know what to do, is dating someone who is 15yrs my senior a good idea? Should I just leave him be?""",,1541991600,,,25,4,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2186402964728549&id=455528264482703,

I've been interviewing with my dream company for the past two months and worked my ass off to last their final round. I just felt like I've been waiting for this moment for too long. Born and raised in a super small city near the east coast, I felt grateful attending colleges in NY. I just can't wait to start a new life here and make my parents be more proud. Well then I failed. I received a phone call yesterday morning and was told that they wouldn't be able to move my application further. My brain went blank immediately. For all these years, I've been following this comoany and dreaming of starting my career with it. Now it all becomes impossible. And it made me even sadder for “ALMOST getting it”.

It literally felt like I lost all the energy to do anything. I'm also a little sad that nearly all my friends were telling me that it'd be okay. I'd find other amazing ones cuz I'm a NYU kid.

I just can't wait to start a new life here and make my parents be more proud. Well then I failed. I received a phone call yesterday morning and was told that they wouldn't be able to move my application further. My brain went blank immediately. For all these years, I've been following this comoany and dreaming of starting my career with it. Now it all becomes impossible. And it made me even sadder for “ALMOST getting it”. I know I should start looking for other companies since the graduation approaches. But I really felt like shit these days. And it's not only emotionally. It literally felt like I lost all the energy to do anything. I'm also a little sad that nearly all my friends were telling me that it'd be okay. I'd find other amazing ones cuz I'm a NYU kid.

I've gone through various stages and diagnoses, but bulimia has stuck the longest and it has significantly interfered with my life and with me trying to learn how to deal with other mental health issues and disorders (which I believe are where the EDs stem from). Honestly, other than a few better one-week periods, I have been doing the worst ever these past two years. Nonetheless, I have learned a few things along the way. I try to take note of the patterns in my thinking and behavior, and of what triggers them—this includes understanding what situations and conversations/remarks make me feel uncomfortable. So, if you are concerned and aware that someone else's words might affect you in a negative way, and if you know you will be spending time and talking with that person, be clear about your boundaries. If someone doesn't deal with this sort of problem, even if they do acknowledge and try to empathize with you having an eating disorder, they might not understand to what extent their words/actions can hurt, affect, or trigger you. It might seem difficult, but try to be explicit and assertive; and there is no need to feel weird or embarrassed trying to explain how you feel just because you seem to find the subject more sensitive (e.g. as a male) than they do—we all have different perspective. Even if you have been playing along and joking around it, it's never too late to say ""You know how sometimes we joke about my [weight/eating habits]?

The other person should be able to respect that you are dealing with something, even if they themselves do not, and back off. Denying (or trying to determine, oh my) others' feelings or perception is just plain thoughtless and inconsiderate, and it's no point in keeping such toxic relationships long-term. This applies to all struggles and life as is. So please listen to what your friends have to say and, even if you can't relate, you will be able to understand and connect with them—as long as you appreciate, respect, and care for them. P.S. If anyone would be interested, my therapist told me that there is an ED group at the Wellness Center, so look into it if you think it might help you, or if you want to try it out or just vent!

Your parents' job is to love you unconditionally. They have failed as parents if they think that their child is unworthy of love because of something like this.
At least, that's what I tell myself (lol). When I hear my mother speak in disgust when a man acts ""girly"" on TV or when she asks if I have a girlfriend yet, there's no doubt in my mind that she would have a negative reaction to my coming out. But, I've also realized how toxic of a person she can be so meh.
The thing is I don't think I'll ever come out to my family. I wonder if I would be disowned if I ever did. I wonder if my parents would cry about not having grandchildren, or having a ""deviant"" for a son, or whatever they would be concerned about (like damn at least I'm not a drug dealer). I wonder if I will ever be able to live my life to the fullest if I have such a large part of my identity hidden.
Being queer means you get to/have to choose your family.
Being a child of strict non-western parents means the burden of guilt for the rest of your life.

I shouldn’t feel guilty about having money but I do, because for some reason I get automatically bunched into a group with the spoiled rich kids whose parents rent nightclubs for them on Halloween. But I don’t feel happy around upper-class people either because they all want to go out and spend $50 on partying and clubs every weekend, which makes me just as uncomfortable. Where are the kids at NYU that don’t hate rich people but aren’t snobby pricks either?""",,1540166401,,,140,36,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2153361111366068&id=455528264482703,

This is my experience with the mental health center. Literally, earlier this morning, I call the health center to try and schedule a psychiatric appointment. I tell the psychiatrist that I'm feeling suicidal. I tell them that I'm going to cut my wrists open and kill myself. I tell them that the only reason I haven't yet is because I don't want to rush it. That I want to make sure I know exactly what I'm about to do. And that every day I get closer and closer to that tipping point. The psychiatrist transfers me to the front desk to schedule an in person appointment. The desk says they can get me an appointment on the 10th, 8 days later. I ask if there is anything sooner. The desk says all they have is the 10th at the same time that I have class. I ask is there really nothing sooner? The desk says all they have is the 10th. I ask if they have anything available the next day, on the 11th. The desk tells me no, all they have open is the time on the 10th and that's when I angrily hang up.

I've had friends tell me to reach out to them. But how can I burden them with my depression? And what can they possibly say that would make me view the world and my situation any different? Can you imagine talking to one your closest friends about wanting to kill yourself, and then still end up killing yourself because there is nothing they can do to solve your problems or change your outlook on life? Can you imagine what that does to your friend, knowing that even after everything they said, it wasn't enough to stop you from killing yourself. I wouldn't do that to my friends or family. So that left me with one reasonable option, medication. Maybe I can dissuade my suicidal thoughts if I manage to find the right concotion of chemicals.

2127112517324261,"Hi everyone! It's Carly, the former admin.
As some of you may know, an NYU first year student died by suicide this afternoon. It's hard to know what to say when heartbreaking instances like this happen, but here's what I hope you all (especially any freshmen reading this) know.
Starting college and adjusting to adult life can be so hard, alienating, and lonely, especially if you're just moving to NYC and don't have an established support system. Classes are hard and it's so easy to put performing academically above your health. Periods of transition in life are always really stressful, and it's important to check in with yourself and your friends to make sure you're handling big changes in a way that respects our mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing. Just remember that you're not alone and that you are loved.

This is the story of how I stern-failed (got a C in a stern class) a required course freshman year, and it's something I've never told anyone before. It was a few years ago, in a Stern class, and even though I've just about moved on, I'm pretty sure nobody's forgotten. I'd like to preface the story with the fact that I'm not a very bright student (especially compared to some of the other kids in the class). On the day of the final exam (the last day of the semester), after a semester of just barely scraping by, I decided to use up the last of my meal plan at Downstein dining hall. I ate a full meal of fruit and cereal and really enjoyed it, but I had one more swipe that I didn't know how to use. So, I decided to pack a snack for the road and filled a to-go carton entirely with hard-boiled eggs. There must have been at least 15 eggs in there after I crammed them all in there. Come exam time, I started to get really nervous (like I said, I wasn't the most intellectually gifted person in my class). And, when I get nervous, I eat. Like, big time. So, to cope with all of the stress of this final exam (this is literally the difference between a C and a B), I started to eat my eggs, one after another. It wasn't until the seventh lukewarm hard-boiled egg I realized that these eggs had a rather ""sour"" flavor to them. definitely not ideal before an exam. But, being nervous and pressured and consequentially hungry as a fat man on thanksgiving, I decided to bypass the unsavory flavor in my mouth and continue pursuing the eggs. At the time, I was unsure if that was the right move, but I continued to eat the eggs one after another. I was honestly so afraid of failing the exam that my temptation overcame any sense of judgment I could have mustered. Fifteen-or-so eggs later, the carton was empty, and I felt relieved. Unfortunately, this relief didn't last long, as my stomach could only manage to hold down my stress-eggs for about an hour. Thirty-five minutes (and 12/50 questions) into the exam, I was struck by an overwhelming desire to instantly purge all fifteen eggs- from both ends. I stood up quickly and nonchalantly made my way to the aisle when I screamed ""ITS AN EMERGENCY"" and ran towards the door. The TA told me on my way out that I'd forfeit my exam if I left, to which I replied ""egg-scuse me sir It's an emergency"". I'm a little upset that pun didn't work, but that's neither here nor there. What WAS there was a stall in the Tisch Hall UC bathrooms that was completely ruined. Let me tell you, I TRIED to get it all in the toilet, but when both ends are refusing to wait for each other, it very quickly becomes very difficult to control. Upon returning to the classroom a mere forty-five minutes later, I was greeted by the same TA who handed me my backpack, pencil, and calculator, and asked me to go home. It was my first and only C of my college career. I still haven't told my parents, nor have I had a hard-boiled egg since- and to be honest, I don't think I ever will.""","#10,276: ""I think I'm finally ready to tell the world, even if nobody chooses to believe me.

2092621794106667,"#10,265: ""At the end of my freshman year, I hung out with this person from a club I was in who I had always had a secret crush on — though in retrospect, I guess my crush wasn’t that secret; they definitely knew. We hadn’t really seen each other in months — I had quit the club after some time and didn’t really run into them much after that. When we hung out at the end of the year, we ended up hooking up — but this was really only because they initiated. I complied, and I remember feeling at first surprised and flattered that this person, at least in a physical capacity, returned my feelings. The shock was (quite literally) paralyzing.
The thing I’ve realized about some crushes is that they’re better off left as fantasies than enacted realities. I can’t really place why I felt this specific way about this specific person, but I did. And the entire interaction felt so strange. Something was just off. I wasn’t enjoying it. I was telling them, no, I didn’t want to go further, I didn’t want to have sex, but then they kept asking for oral, and I just went with it. After all, I had refused them one thing. It felt uncomfortable to continue rejecting them, especially in a situation that was moving way too fast for me to truly know if I wanted it.
I didn’t really ponder the situation beyond my discomfort until the Aziz Ansari story came out earlier this year. That particular narrative vocalized where the exact source of my discomfort lied: coercion and a lack of direct communication on both sides. In a way, reading about Aziz was like opening Pandora’s box. I can now no longer ignore my experience with the ex-crush and pretend it was “just a bad hook-up”.
They’ve taken some time off and will be coming back. For all surface purposes, we’re friendly. Part of me wants to talk to them, and explain that what they did was wrong, and that they shouldn’t coerce emotionally vulnerable and generally fragile people into sexual acts. I definitely don’t plan on taking it up with the university. They’ve had a really difficult year, and it’s not like I’m traumatized or anything. But I just want them to understand why it was wrong so that it won’t happen again.

I wasn't always like this: when I first got to NYU I took my teaching very seriously. I made every effort I could to ensure my students had a complete and solid formation. I spent a long time preparing lectures, covering the hardest parts of my discipline in a very detailed way. I gave assignments that required a lot of work to make sure students grasped the content, I asked to meet with students who I saw were having trouble with the class 1-1, and I did not let anyone leave the class without being absolutely sure they were prepared for what came next.
The result? Students were falling asleep, or glued to their PC during the lectures, they never showed up for OH, constantly complained about the workload, and were always upset because of their grade. More than half the students I had left the class. I got terrible evaluations, and at some point I was even in danger of loosing my lecturing position. From what I could tell, students were constantly reviling me and my class.
So I started to give in; instead of giving a thorough, deep lecture, I just gave a rough picture. I left little to no work, and in the end gave everyone about three points more than the grade they deserved. By now my lecture is half jokes and anecdotes. I don't think my students are prepared for anything and I don't care. Of course, I stick to the official syllabus, use and standard textbook, and follow all the rules to avoid getting into trouble, but I know that my class fails to transmit anything useful or valuable.
What's the bottom line here? Thank you NYU undergrads, thanks to you I can spend 0 effort giving a class that I know is bad, while having great evaluations, and students that love me. I have time for research, to spend with my family, and of course a very generous salary, courtesy of your student debt.""","#10,235: ""I am professor in NYU, I give the worst class I could possibly imagine and I love it-everyone loves it.

The oddest (and by far the best) of all was being an intern for a very popular social media personality for a semester. She was a spokesmodel for a popular unisex lingerie brand, which sold everything from lacy bras and panties to men's underwear. One day, she asked me to be her personal assistant/ PA on a shoot where they'd be posing with a bunch of instafamous male models. Considering I wanted on set experience and am an 18-year-old girl tryna get some digits, I said yes almost instantly.

When I come back, I hand them to the director and he calls over all the male models. He reaches into the bag and hands one to each of the guys. ""you all know the drill,"" he says. They suddenly start opening up their underwear. I turn away to face the wall, not wanting to invade their privacy. ""Put your dick in it like a hot dog and mold it so it looks like a nice round bulge,"" he says. ""It's not you it's the underwear.""

To this day, months later, I can't even follow hot male models on insta because it's all I can picture when I see them in underwear/ a swimsuit. It's not real, it's just buns.

1807326812636168,"ADMIN APPLICATION
I can't believe this day is here already. Here we go.
As some of you know, I will be graduating this spring and am looking for a new admin to take over NYU Secrets starting in early September (I'll be running the page through Welcome Week). If you're an NYU student, love this page and are interested in this position, please apply by submitting your answers to the questions below to the NYUS Facebook inbox. The deadline is two weeks from today on Sunday, March 11.
It might seem like all the role of admin entails is copying and pasting, but I should warn you that running NYUS is a lot of work. The next admin should be willing to spend anywhere from 10-20 hours a week (depending on the week) running this page, which includes posting secrets, working on advocacy programs, moderating comments, directing OP's in distress to people who can help them, and a number of other random tasks. Let's put it this way, running NYUS is so time and labor intensive that my parents have been begging me to take it as an independent study for three semesters now (sorry mom!). That said, I promise you acting as admin is so deeply rewarding and is worth every minute.
Writing skills, social media experience, basic social work skills, and student government/ advocacy experience are all a plus, but there are only two requirements for this position - you must be a current NYU student, and you must love NYUS as much as Aristo and I do. Undergrads and graduate students are both welcome to apply. The more time left at NYU, the better (looking at you, freshmen and sophomores).
Finally, I apologize for being more vocal in the last few posts. I only have six more months left as admin, so why not have some fun with it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I look forward to reading your applications!
1. Tell me about yourself, including school/major/year.
2. Why do you want to be the administrator of NYU Secrets? 3. What is your experience with NYU Secrets?
4. In your opinion, what role does NYU Secrets serve?
5. What types of secrets would you post? What types would you never post (if any)?
6. Who would you tell about your role as the admin? What value do you place on the administrator being anonymous?
7. What is your stance on bias and censorship on NYUS?
8. Where would you like to see NYU Secrets by the time you're ready to pass it on to the next admin?
9. Do you think the role of NYUS admin should included advocacy? why or why not.
10. If you were admin, when and why would you reach out to NYU administration?
11. What is your experience with other forms of social media? What apps do you use most regularly?
12. You get cursed at, people write mean things about you, there’s a ton of pressure. Seriously—WHY do you want to do this?
13. Anything else you'd like to say or that you want me and Aristo to know?","ADMIN APPLICATION

This is going to sound aggro, but I'd be happy that the University is at least doing something for your heritage. In my four years, I haven't seen NYU (or any institution, for that matter) give so much as a solitary fuck about Asian-American/Pacific Islander Heritage Month (May). We are invisible. We are ignored.

This is going to sound aggro, but I'd be happy that the University is at least doing something for your heritage. In my four years, I haven't seen NYU (or any institution, for that matter) give so much as a solitary fuck about Asian-American/Pacific Islander Heritage Month (May). We are invisible. We are ignored.

Flash forward a month or two and our first paper is due. The professor agrees to meet with students outside of class to go over our topics and answer any other questions. So my two friends and I discuss a meeting time with him after class one day and he suggests a bar near by (this was abroad so legal). We go to the bar and it’s chill we’re talking about our papers having a couple well drinks etc etc. All of a sudden he’s suggesting we do shots and well I’m a bit annoyed because I really did need help on my paper but you’re not gonna turn down doing shots with your professor on a week night right? Everything is a bit of a blur but soon enough we are closing out the bar trying to find our way home (which was miles away). Except plot twist: every public transportation is shut down. Our professor suggests we just sleepover at this place ya know no big deal. So yep me and my two friends take the bed, he takes the floor. Honestly the whole thing seemed to make sense at the time. We wake up the next morning and obviously everyone feels #weird. We end up leaving sooooo awkwardly and uncomfortably as one does in the morning hungover at a home that is not your own. The silver lining to this hot mess is that we were supposed to have class later that day but I think everyone felt a bit too hungover and awkward enough that he ended up canceling per our suggestion. I could go on about this prof but those are other people’s stories to tell...so yeah that’s the story of the time I slept over at my professors apartment and nothing was the same.

This could be anything from your extremely drunk aunt going on a long (and partially musical) rant about her love affair with Henry Kissinger in the 60's, to your grandfather loudly and unapologetically farting in your face as he gets up for seconds (both true stories from my family). Whatever it is, send 'em on in. Happy Holidays!

My roommate then went to open the fridge, which is directly behind the couch, where I and the topless girl were, giving him a full frontal view. At this point I was stunned that he would go this far given that she's practically naked. I then ask him what he is making, to which he said ""peanut butter sandwich"". He put the sandwich in the microwave for literally 4 seconds, not enough time to make any actual impact on the temperature of the sandwich, then grabbed a bag and left.

Upon meeting both of these women, it was immediately clear that they deeply care about the wellbeing of NYU students and truly prioritize improving the NYU Wellness Exchange in any way possible. They were incredibly kind and more than willing to listen.
After reading through the submissions regarding NYU Wellness, we came to the conclusion that through the protections of anonymity on NYU Secrets, a lot of the critiques, though in some cases very disturbing, could not bring about the necessary change. Without details like dates, and names of counselors, it’s impossible for the NYU Wellness staff to investigate what occurred in those instances and make necessary interventions accordingly.
For this reason, NYU Secrets will be introducing a new forum, where students who have had a negative experience with mental health services at NYU can send an overview of the incident anonymously to the page, where I, an unaffiliated third party, will essentially act as a middleman between OP and NYU Wellness. The process can be as brief as sending in an incident report along with the time and date it occurred, or as involved as having me act as a liaison in reporting the incident - it’s all up to OP. These submissions will not be posted publicly, nor will any personal information be shared with Wellness without explicit permission from OP.
Of course, students still have the ability to use existing channels to provide feedback such as contacting the Patient Advocate at the Student Health Center. The email address is health.feedback@nyu.edu.
As we’ve seen, NYU Wellness, just like everything else, is not perfect, and there will always be ways they can improve to help better serve the NYU community. That said, don’t let the negative posts dissuade you if you’re thinking of getting help. As we’ve also seen, some student have great experiences with them. Wellness is an incredible resource that has positive impacted many student’s lives - mine included. Hopefully this new forum will be another way to make sure NYU Wellness is the best possible resource for NYU students and faculty.

He was always kind, sweet, supportive, and I felt I could trust him with my life. He was (and somehow still is) my best friend, and I've been trying my best to move on and forgive him. I watched a video today about the ""adorkable misogyny"" of the Big Bang Theory among other films and TV shows and I started crying, because I feel like I've identified part of why he did it.

Having your freedom completely stripped away and constantly being told that it's for your own good is such a traumatic experience. If you've hurt someone, or are a danger to others, then I could see how this would be a beneficial system. But I didn't and neither did any of the other children in their with me.
I spent the entire time there reading about my rights and trying to figure out the fastest way out. I missed an entire week of school and had to beg the nurses to allow my mom to bring me my schoolwork since visitors were not allowed to bring anything into the facility. I was not allowed to see an actual therapist or psychiatrist and instead my family was threatened that if they did not find me one I would be taken away by social services. With my anxiety in overdrive from being a new place with people I didn't know or trust, I was unable to sleep on the uncomfortable beds. I wasn't allowed to stay awake and write, which always calms me down, either becuase I wasn't allowed to have pencils in my room. My bathroom door did not lock and during the day I was only allowed to go into my room if I wanted to lose points. The point system separated the ""good"" kids from the ""bad"" kids and you only got points for being social. If you complained, you lost points. If you woke up too early, you lost points. If you didn't participate, you lost points. Only the ""good"" kids were allowed to eat lunch together. Everyone else had to eat alone in the TV room in silence.
Before I was sent there, I was placed in a halfway room at the local hospital. The room is no bigger than the average NYU dorm. The bathroom is large but only because the toilet is in the shower. They sat us in front of a TV for 12 hours and gave us, a group of 12-17 year olds, dolls to play with. The boys and girls aren't separated and there is never a second of privacy. Not even in the bathroom where a female attendant had to sit and watch me pee. In the bathroom, where I was forced to strip to prove to these people who were not doctors that I had never harmed myself (and then do it again when I arrived at the actual facility).
All in all it was the most dehumanizing experience of my life and there are details I don't even feel comfortable sharing anonymously. The only good that came out of it was that I made a couple of real friends. I read all the hand outs they gave us and I would share the information with the others. We were forced to take medication without knowing anything more than what they were named so I read all the medical handouts I could find and explained to all of them what the drugs were and what side effects to look out for. I also told them their rights, which unfortunately were not many, because no one had explained it to them.

The summer before my freshman year, I was sexually assaulted at my best friends house by her boyfriend, Adam*. That night, Adam stole my virginity in a very public setting while people I’d known since kindergarten watched. I don’t even remember what happened, but one of my ‘friends’ told me that people heard screams and they all ran over to find Adam on top of me. Everyone thought it was scandalous because I was such a ‘slut’ and that I ‘fucked my bff’s boyfriend’. Rather than say that he raped me and that I couldn’t remember anything that happened, I kept my head low, my mouth shut and counted down the days until move-in day. I kept trying to rationalize the assault, telling myself that it was my fault because I had been drinking and wearing revealing clothing.
During welcome week, I met Joe*. At the time, I had never met anyone like him before. He was cute, funny, he really liked me and when I was with him, he made me laugh so hard that I forgot, at least momentarily, about my past. We fell for each other fast. We started dating shortly after and I had never felt this way about anyone before.
One day, we started talking about our past relationships. His were so normal; stories about proms, movie dates etc., and it made me so jealous and scared—so I lied, to Joe and myself. I said that I had dated Adam in high school but that we broke up because he was pressuring me into having sex and that I was still a virgin. I wanted him to think I was normal too, I didn’t want him to see me differently, as the ‘slut’ my friends from home now thought of me as, or as damaged goods and scare him off.
Eventually, Joe and I broke up; actually I broke up with him. When I broke it off, I’d never seen someone look so hurt before. I never even gave him an explanation as to why I was ending things, I just said, “it’s not really working between us anymore” and he said something to the affect of, “I should have known, I felt you pulling away for a while now, I just wish there was something I could have done to keep you from leaving”.
I broke up with him because I had become extremely depressed and unable to come to terms with my assault. I was a horrible partner to him, and while we both made mistakes in the relationship, I would ice him out and treat him terribly for what would seem like no reason but it was because I couldn’t deal with my own emotions. I wasn’t ready for a relationship, but I so desperately wanted to be normal and have someone who loved me during this stressful time. I really did love him, but there were some things I just couldn’t tell him, or even tell myself.
I started going to therapy, prioritizing my mental health and being honest with others and myself about my past. I’ve told my friends about what happened and they’ve all been very supportive.
But, I still think about Joe. I feel so guilty for the way I treated him. To this day, he still doesn’t know the real reason why I ended things with him, and it kills me that he might think it was his fault. Part of me wants to tell him and maybe try to explain why I was so cold and mean to him when he only offered kindness. Part of me feels like it would be selfish to re-open the past, it’s been almost two years and he’s happy with a new girlfriend and telling him this might just make things worse.

Thank you all for everything 💜""",,1495411694,,,217,12,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1487553694613483&id=455528264482703,

Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school,
three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
You did come back different.
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!
- Bee-men.
- Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...
...9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies.
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
Will we pick ourjob today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
Our top-secret formula
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
into this soothing sweet syrup
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
Honey!
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Oheck it out.
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.""
Okay, I'm done with shitposting now.","#9525: ""According to all known laws
of aviation,
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!

Hello?
- Barry?
- Adam?
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.

I met this guy my freshman year and from the very beginning he made it clear he was into me. I felt the opposite. He was awkward yet cocky and he just went about expressing his interest in all the wrong ways. I was very clear about saying I didn't like him but nevertheless he persisted. We worked together so I couldn't really escape him. He never crossed any lines and wasn't creepy but I always felt awkward around him. I figured with time he'd give up, find a new interest, or realize he was gay.
Nope. About halfway through our senior year we started connecting again; we'd get lunch every so often or we'd talk at work. Then senior week happened and that changed everything. After 3 years of distant distain I actually started to enjoy his company. I guess we both just grew up or I misjudged him or something. I also had gone through a really bad relationship and realized I deserve better. Turns out he was the ""better"" I was looking for.
We took some really cute pics on the roof at senior cruise, then drank together at strawberries and champagne, and then at senior formal the friend I was with left early so naturally he found me by myself and kept me company the rest of the night. That night was the first night we held hands when he grabbed my hand to bring me to the dance floor then up onto the DJ booth to dance with him and his friends. We had one last lunch planned for the semester but that turned into dinner where he officially asked me on a date. The thing is, I was already seeing someone else, not exclusively, but still. I said I couldn't.
He respected that but we still ended up seeing each other almost every single day. After he brought me my favorite food in Bobst while I was studying (he'd never go to Bobst on his own accord) and a couple other cute things I agreed to go on a date with him. I eventually chose him and broke up with the other guy.
There were 18 days between our first date and the day he left to go to his new job across the country. We fell in love knowing full well we'd be worlds away soon. Still it was nothing short of magical. He took me on the most epic, romantic date I've ever been on. Central Park, picnic, champagne, the whole nine yards. I ended up crying in his arms that night after something triggered a bad memory from my previous bad relationship. He just held me and told me everything would be okay and he would still be there for me no matter what. It was a day straight out of a rom com. On our last day together before he left when he told me he loved me. And told him I loved him too.
We kept dating for a bit after he left trying to visit each other as often as we could but we realized that long distance doesn't work if one of you has 0 vacation days and you probably won't have jobs in the same city the next 3-4 years of not longer. So we broke up just before our 6th month anniversary.
If you're reading this, I still love you and I still have hope that we will be together again. Someday. A la prochain fois.

I was relieved by this institution, with its liberal atmosphere and a diverse body of international students, but I know that the same racism that haunted me, still exists. It was there all along, and all of it exploded to ensue a situation like this where families and friends are separated and are in total grief.
I am not generalizing though, and there are of course good, inviting Americans who appreciate the values that founded this country. However, the rude, condescending looks of Airport securities ruin the whole barrel. Saddening really.

This was a ROUGH night for me. It was my first night studying abroad and I had just finished watching most of the Bronco's beating. Several other students & I decided to go find some weed, since we had just moved to the abroad site and needed a new connection. We had heard that several bars around the city sold weed, so we decided to try finding one. This was a lot harder than it sounds, as the language barrier between us and the Uber Driver landed us in a random location in the city. I'm upset about the Pats loss... bummed we couldn't find a bar that sold weed... and very intoxicated.... so, decide to ask strangers on the streets in they could help us find some weed.
THIS IS WHERE SHIT GETS FUCKED!! Some dudes like ""yeah my buddy is coming through in like an hour and can sell you some weed... here, I am a bouncer at this club; you guys can wait inside for free"". Being fresh outta New York, a free club sounded nice, especially if it would result in a weed fix. We go in, and I immediately go to the bar to grab a beer. Its all women sitting at the bar and two start grabbing my hand and reaching it towards their pussy saying ""Sex!?"" I'm like word this is easy, so I go to touch one of the women, but she stops me and is like ""Nope, pay first"". Realizing we are at a Brothel, I go sit down with my buddies to share this story. Anyways, five minutes later, one of the women came back and sat down with us, trying to persuade someone to buy in. Silly drunk me caved, and grabbed another prostitute to join us.
Uhhh... worst experience of my life. I spent $80 on each prostitute for 30 minutes, another $80 to stay for ANOTHER 30 minutes (so $240 so far).The sex was so bad and forced, I didn't finish. I then paid another like $80 to take my fucking condom off, so the sex would feel at least somewhat decent. And I think another $40 for some other bullshit. My friends I came with (who I literally just met that day) were like yelling my name, thinking I was gonna get like killed, I'm not answering, it was just a whole damn mess.

(Yeah I know grades don't define you but when recruiters are scanning resumes, I can't help but think that's the first thing they weed out when you don't have any other relevant experience and sure, call me salty and bitter but it sucks to be in the minority of college milestones and possibly be a statistic of the small percentage of students who don't have plans after graduation).
The Career Center didn't help and all their suggestions are things that I just don't have the resources to have access to. I'm sorry that my parents aren't well off with connections from work who can get my foot in the door like some of the students here (""Oh yeah I only got this internship at XYZ big company because my mom knows the XYZ senior VP - otherwise I'd be totally screwed""). I've tried LinkedIn for alumni connections but I don't get how they're going to help me when they're trying to hold onto their first job themselves and have no power in upper management? And yes, I know I'm not entitled to a job just B/C I go to NYU. How do you get experience without experience?

1. People are good.
2. There isn't enough understanding between us. We (as NYU students and beyond) look for too many reasons to divide ourselves. Look for the good and you'll find it.
3. We should love each other more and love each other better.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I'll remember this experience for the rest of my life.

NYU Secrets is more than just a social media project on gossip. It's the beginning of something profound.

888977634471095,"#8997: ""I’m a senior who is graduating this spring and I want to tell my true NYU story. I haven’t told my friends this because I don’t want to burden them with all of my regrets. Me not living up to my potential is college is my problem and will be my problem alone. Also my friends wouldn’t see me the same way if I told them this story. They know pieces of it but not the whole thing.
To understand my freshmen year it’s paramount to understand my senior year of high school. I went to giant high school over 2000+ students. As a freshman in high school I was bullied a lot and only had friends who were special ed. I myself was not special ed but I noticed I trusted people with Asperger’s more than I did mainstream people. I found them very shallow. I was a judgmental SOB throughout high school. The bullying stopped sophomore year. However I was so timid and shy I made barely any friends in high school. I was also academically terrible. I went to an academically competitive high school and my grades were shit. This troubled me because I noticed all of the students who got high grades also partied a lot and had great social lives while I had no friends and studied all of the time and did very poorly.
By the time senior year roll by I was depressed. I did manage to make a lot of friends junior year. However at senior year I realized I did not live up to my social and academic potential in high school. I did become however a better student by senior year and took very advanced classes. However I was still depressed because everyone was making memories that will last a life time there senior year while all I did was work. I was so depressed I didn’t even go to my own Prom. I graduated high school with barely any friends and noteworthy memories. I was very depressed my summer of senior year. Not suicidal but very depressed. By the time I started NYU I got over my depression and was ready to start anew. I made some mistakes though. I never went to any freshman events and never met any of the incoming freshmen.
As a commuter it was tough to make new friends but I compounded the problem by not joining any clubs or anything. I also lived in a very poor area where NYU students don’t live in. My biggest mistake though was my arrogance as a freshman. I only wanted to be friends with people who I believed were of my intellectual caliber. As a senior I took lots of advanced classes and because of that as a freshman in college I didn’t need to take the large lecture hall Freshman classes. Instead I took sophomore and junior level classes my freshman year. Even in these classes I didn’t try to make friends there. I would also look down and mock freshman who had to take typically Freshman classes because I was so advanced. During my first two years I had a 4.0 GPA. I was really arrogant because I was the number one student in my major. I let it go to my head because while in high school I was always the worst student in the class. The bottom of the bottom.
This caused me to have a very bad attitude towards people and turned them off from me. Also I wanted to redeem my high school experience and try to become friends with the popular kids. In this endeavor I did succeed in and I usually hung out with my high school friends. However I would only see my high school friends during breaks. I however made very few friends at NYU and again this was due to my own tragic design. I never had a girl friend or anything here. Starting my senior year I saw the error of my ways and dropped my attitude and slapped my freshmen self in the face for turning so many people off of me. However now it’s too little too late. I did make a lot of friends my senior year but I’m graduating now and as I look back on all of the fun people I know had in college I feel sad that I didn’t get to experience that because of my own terrible attitude. I am thankful for all of the friends I made Senior year and I hope to keep in touch with them after college.
I just wish all of the girls I know didn’t all have boyfriends they met freshman year or sophomore year. FYI my crowd isn’t the threesome with Cocaine hookup crowd. My crowd is Nerdy with a capital N and I’m happy for that. During junior year I hung out with crowd that did hard drugs and my grades suffered. That killed my chance of being valedictorian. I didn’t do any drugs myself but whenever they got into stupid shit I had to help them clean up the mess. When I finally purged them from my life mid junior year I was upset again that I now had barely any friends. An example of their shenanigans was driving around New York City high on Shrooms and seducing a NYPD officer to not arrest their asses. It actually worked amazingly. These are not the type of people I wanted in my life. If I made friends my freshmen year instead of not talking to them and being like ha ha you’re taking such basic as shit classes look at me I’m a freshmen taking Senior level electrodynamics it would have been different. Also my problem is that I never struggled through college.
I’ve noticed that the closest friends circles in NYU are those who struggle together. I know a group of people in a certain engineering major who are so tight. They are tight because they would spend time together in the Library studying so hard. Having those hard nighters and pushing themselves. After studying super hard together for the exam they would all party together. I never struggled like that. I never struggled with someone to get work done. Every time someone asked to study with me I would tell them no because I thought they would slow me down. I didn’t realize that studying together with someone can help build a friendship.
I’ll be graduating college in my opinion not having a complete college experience. I did not live up to my social potential in college which saddens me.""","#8997: ""I’m a senior who is graduating this spring and I want to tell my true NYU story.

875842282451297,"#8822: ""This long and windy post is in response to the freak-out about the cost of an NYU education. It’s not as simple as multiplying a year’s tuition by 4. You have to account for the varying interest rates of each loan, as well as subtract any scholarships & grants included in your package.
I am **not** assuming that nobody understands how interest works — I just want to paint a transparent picture for those who don’t, especially 2019 prospectives. And no, #iamnotstern.
As a senior who’s about to graduate, I’ll use my package as an example.
My general school scholarship and pell grant cover roughly half of my tuition each year. Out of a $66K tuition, that leaves just about $33K in loans annually. Let’s see the interest rate of each loan:
1) Stafford (Subsidized) Loan: 3.40 ~ 4.66%
2) Unsubsidized Loan: 3.86 ~ 6.80%
3) Federal PLUS Loan: 6.41 ~ 7.90%
The reason I listed a range is because the interest rate changes each year depending on a host of factors. When I was a freshman (way back when) the economy was still recovering from the recession — this screwed over anyone who wanted to borrow money at the time, as banks needed to hedge against the risk of the borrowers defaulting. Thus, my PLUS Loan interest rate over the 2011 - 2012 academic year was a nightmarish 7.90%.
At that rate, the $100,000 you borrow will balloon to $213,901 in 10 years, $457,540 in 20 years, and $978,685 in 30 years.
As scary as this sounds, you’ll at least be reducing the base amount you owe (principal) with each monthly payment. And even though your PLUS loans comprise the majority of your total loans, the lower rates of subsidized and unsubsidized loans should somewhat help.
I’ll return to my example. Upon graduation, I will have a grand total of $130,901 in loans under my belt. The weighted average interest rate on this amount will be 6.59%. Here’s a set of years, monthly payments and total amount required to repay this in its entirety:
1) 15 Years - $1,155 / month. $207,900 total. Debt-free by 37.
2) 30 Years - $842 / month. $303,120 total. Debt-free by 52.
3) 40 Years - $783 / month. $375,840 total. Debt-free by 62.
Let’s incorporate this into a salary.
I’ll be making roughly $70,000 / year. After taking into account both state and federal tax rates, this will be slashed to $56,000. My estimated monthly rent, utilities, and credit card bills will be $2,000. I plan to pay back $1,000 towards my loan each month. I hope to save $500 each month for vacations or general emergencies. This leaves me with about $300 for my own spending each week, or an allowance of $43 per day for food, groceries, metro, etc.
Notice how I have yet to consider getting a car, getting a mortgage, or helping my parents out with their own bills — all things I will need to do in the future.
Some key takeaways and TL;DR:
1) If you are a full-time, four-year undergrad with 50/50 in scholarships/loans, you will need to pay $800+ per month to be debt-free in 30 years. This will obviously look a lot worse if you’re covered through loans only.
2) Borrowing $130,000 means you’ll end up paying back double, triple, or quadruple that amount depending on how quickly (or slowly) you choose to repay it.
3) If you’re a prospective student and you don’t think you'll be able to afford this upon graduation, consider a cheaper degree.
4) If you’re a current student and don’t think you’ll be able to afford this upon graduation, you can either consider transferring, or taking on loan deferment and/or forbearance.
5) If you do qualify for loan deferment/forbearance based on a low salary or familial emergency, realize that interest will continue to accrue regardless. You’ll be paying less today but more overall.
6) In rare cases, you can qualify for loan forgiveness. This usually entails working in the public sector.
Other considerations and highly biased personal advice:
1) Be wary of grad school, which tends to be more expensive. I’m not sure how the interest rates differ but you may potentially double your debt. That said, you’ll obviously receive a salary bump with the extra degree.
2) Invest your savings if you can. You may be scrambling to make ends meet at first, but once you get some extra income it could make a world’s difference. In recent years, the U.S. market has returned well over the rate at which you’re borrowing your loans. One way to do this would be to set a disciplined schedule to invest your savings (e.g., $100 / month).
3) Finally, understand that the overall price tag represents not only the NYU degree, but the NYU experience based on your perspective. People often ask me whether I regret choosing NYU, but I honestly don’t. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed each and every year here. I’ve met amazing friends, connected with amazing professors, enjoyed amazing academic and athletic facilities, and eaten amazing food unavailable anywhere else. I think of my loans as the cost I've incurred to enjoy what may be the best four years of my life, in a place I think is the greatest city in the world. Of course, there are others who aren’t as fortunate. If you think New York City or NYU is overrated, then clearly the cost of going to school here is not worth the benefits. But I do believe that it’s possible to make the price worth it by actively enjoying the fuck out of your four years.""","#8822: ""This long and windy post is in response to the freak-out about the cost of an NYU education.

You can't have it both ways. Either you think that soldiers are doing the right thing - killing civilians identified as insurgents which somehow relates to our freedom - or you think that soldiers stationed in places like Iraq and Afghanistan are doing fruitless work and that the military is wasting trillions.
In the War on Terror, the American military has killed HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of 'terrorists' and just as many civilians. But only several thousands of American troops have fallen in combat, and only a fraction of our veterans have ever fired a weapon at an enemy combatant.
The American military is mostly comprised of non-combat roles. Overall, being employed in the military is far less dangerous than being employed in other American industries such as industrial logging and fishing.
In conclusion, don't support blind veneration of American veterans. Most veterans don't go into combat. And those on the front lines who do go into combat and kill people and who are killed themselves DON'T NEED TO.

I understand that my views are labeled as outdated and wrong and I respect that most people do not agree. I usually try to stay away from those types of conversations completely. But most people who I do talk to, know little about my side of the argument which I feel is quite concerning. Before you blatantly reject something maybe take a moment to think about how much you understand of what they believe in rather than simply following what information has been fed to you. I actually enjoy talking about my views when the subjects bring up two-sided conversations rather than one-sided convictions. I believe that if more people were open to having discussions about these types of ideals--and listening to both sides--we would all learn more about the subject as a whole and the traditions/beliefs of those who still hold these views. For example, just because I'm republican doesn't mean that I hate the poor (there was a period in my life when my father was homeless; his income is now about 10k a year), just because I'm Christian doesn't mean I think God hates gay people, and just because I think women should submit to men doesn't mean that I think men do not need to completely respect women.
Sometimes in our defensiveness, we close ourselves off to conversations. The thing is, having a conversation is not always about figuring out who is right/wrong. Sometimes it's simply about getting some insight about a view that you do not agree with and trying to understand why those people hold those views. It does not mean that you have to agree at the end, but usually, if you still don't agree, you at least leave with a better understanding of why you don't agree and why you choose to believe otherwise.
One of the greatest pieces of advice that I ever received was from my Modern Problems teacher in high school who said, ""You will never fully understand what you believe until you fully understand what the other side believes. How are you supposed to prove you do not believe the other side if you never took the initiative to learn their argument in the first place.""

He is me in canine form. He doesn't like people, is very attached to mom, and eats too much. He was depressed for a little bit but got through it. I think also that he has homosexual tendencies.

I'm an introvert. I have trouble being outgoing, especially when I don't know anyone at all. So, freshmen year, I was slow to make friends. I thought I was hopeless. I thought it was just me; something must be wrong with me because everyone else seems to be making all these amazing friends so quickly.
Freshmen year, I went home for winter break without one true friend. I had some kinda sorta friends/classmates, but no one who was genuinely excited to see me again come January.
That first semester made me question a lot about myself. Looking back, though, I think it's just that everyone's experiences are different.
Two years later, I honestly don't talk to anyone from freshmen year. I still look back on it and kind of wish I'd met more people, gone out more, and really put myself out there. If I had, my freshmen year would have been better and more fun.
But, if I had that better freshmen year experience, I don't think I would have applied to study abroad. At the very least, I wouldn't have applied to start my sophomore year abroad. A big reason I applied was because I thought the smaller number of students would make it easier and less overwhelming to meet people.
Studying abroad ended up being one of the best experiences of my life. My mediocre freshmen year led me to a great opportunity, where I made some of the best friends I've ever had.
Everyone's story is unique. Don't worry too much if yours is unfolding differently than you expected. Transitioning to college can be difficult and it takes time (usually not as much time as it took me, but still).

First of all, it is one single test that students will have to take to get into any of the specialize high schools. It is either you get the questions right and score well, or you don't get it right and not be accepted. There is nothing subjective about that. There is no method more objective than a standardize test for any sort of admissions.
Blaming the test and calling it unfair because rich families can afford expensive, high quality test preps for their kids to give them better chance of being accepted while poorer families don't have the luxury to do the same is one of the most ridiculous arguments ever. For one, my family went through the struggles of sparing aside enough money here and there so that I can get all the help I need to have fair shot of going to one of the schools. They did it despite knowing that it will financially cripple them, and that the chances for me to score well with only two years of schooling in America are extremely slim. But they did it anyways. Because they believed that education is the key to success and any amount of money will be worth it in the end. And this is the case with many other families as well.
Instead of changing the already successful testing system and further punishing those families for their hard work, change the way middle schoolers are being educated in school. Instead of complaining about not having the money to afford quality prep, have the kids take advantages of the free tutoring program in schools, and go to libraries and study with the books there. Don't blame the test system just because you don't want to go down the hard road of success and want to change it to cheat your way to success. There are no shortcuts in life.

I also heard a boyfriend abusing his girlfriend in the room next to mine. He put his hands on her, I heard a paroxysm of distress, and as I got out into the hallway to investigate, it had ended. I had heard, however, the boy telling the girl about how she was wasting HIS time in the relationship. How she was not taking it seriously, and that whatever the issue was, was her fault. It was rather convincing, and I do not for a second doubt the penchant for manipulation that abusers have.
Some minutes later, the girl cried that she didn’t feel safe and that she was leaving. The boy yelled, NO, and the door slammed as he grabbed her by the arm to keep her there. I ran out of my room, pounded on the door and brought NYU authorities up to investigate.
This is, I should say, the second time I’ve heard screams from the room. That incident was also reported, and I reminded NYU that this was not an isolated occurrence.
Unfortunately, what the housing department did was: knocked on the door, and asked the girl if she was okay (only the girl answered, the guy always hid although it was his room). Of course, being in the same room as her abuser, she assured them everything was fine, through red cheeks and eyes wet with tears.
I was told that Housing later had a meeting with the girl, privately. That’s all I ever knew. On her Facebook, it says she’s still dating her abuser.
The previous NYU Secrets posting was accused of victim blaming. I understand that someone who has never been in an abusive relationship will never understand the fears that accompany being in one. I also understand the frustration that reporters of domestic violence have since everything is dependent on the admission of the abused. I want to know what would be an improvement to the system we have, one which would make admitting to being a victim to relationship abuse a safe and beneficial one - and on which cultural, individual, psychological, and institutional levels those changes would have to be implemented and acknowledged.
I am also interested in ways in which colleges can make students safer. The abused student lived in the same dorm as her boyfriend. Where was there for her to go? I understand her options were - if they aren’t still - limited.

Dear OP from Secret #5015.
First, thank you for an important question about our campaign. That question is simple: Why I, Too, Am NYU?
https://www.facebook.com/NYUSecrets/posts/684850021550525?comment_id=6764300&notif_t=like
As students of color at an institution that is predominantly white (despite President Sexton's belief that there is ""no racial majority at NYU"" as stated at the MLK Week Campus Wide event in February), our Blackness, Brownness, Latinoness, Nativeness, Asianness, our color, NEEDS to be magnified. If not, everything we bring to this campus will be undermined, undervalued, and underrepresented. This campaign is all about challenging the idea that NYU is an inclusive space for students of color. And yes, that means non-white. We recognize the effort on NYU's part, but something needs to be done about including student's voices in that attempt to increasing diversity and a sense of inclusiveness here. That is what we are doing.
You stated that the campaign highlights a black-white binary. That is simply not true. We've featured people of all races and ethnicities, including Black, Latino, Native American, Asian, people from the Caribbean, Middle East, Africa, South America, Europe, South Asia and so on. This campaign very well could have been about Black and Latino students, but it is not. Just as NYU considers itself a global university, we consider this a global campaign, including many, many different voices.
As for your statement about having our issues raised, it's interesting that you did not exactly deny that such issues actually exist. We face real micro-aggressions, stereotyping, and discrimination on a daily basis. We think that you would agree that we aren't just making noise for the hell of it. We're tired of keeping these discussion in house and ""preaching to the choir"". We are allowing our communities to vent. We will empower ourselves and voice our frustrations, anger, and concerns about life as a student of color at NYU until the entire University really gets it, and until it begins to make real change in how we are served.
We've only released 10 photos, so hopefully your early judgement of our campaign as ""stupid"" will change once we've actually released the remaining 100+ photos.

We aren't making generalizations about people's experiences. We are letting people speak about their own feelings and experiences. If there are overarching trends across racial and cultural backgrounds, what do you think that says about our experiences as students of color at a PWI (predominantly white institution)?
To our supporters and participants, we are committed to being here FOR YOU. Continue to reach out and engage the rest of the community in discussion. The hate and criticism this campaign may receive will never match the outpouring of love, support, and passion we have seen from our communities. We, Too, are NYU.

Turns out, I forgot to hit the damn button. Even more so, someone using the top dryer stole my dollar, thanks to NYU's lovely ""pay for your choice of 2 dryers"" policy. I paid another dollar (that's $3 total now), and this time I made sure to hit that damn button: the machine started spinning.

Several years ago, my sister was raped. Up until last year, she wasn't able to tell anyone about what had happened because she is non-verbal. She is non-verbal because she has cerebral palsy and has no motor control. She is in a wheelchair and can only communicate with her eyes - up for ""yes,"" down for ""no."" Anything that she wants to tell anybody has to be extracted from her by assumptions that lead to yes or no questions that can be asked of her. So when my family tried sending her to a summer camp for disabled kids and young adults a few years back (which we were very reticent about, because the majority of the kids at camps like these have some sort of mental handicap, whereas my sister was only PHYSICALLY disabled -- not that that ever stopped people from talking to her like she was an infant), she had no way to voice her concerns. That's why, until last year, we never found out that a male employee at that camp broke into her cabin and sexually assaulted her in the middle of the night. On multiple occasions. And he was able to do that because she had no way to voice what was happening. When my family was FINALLY able to figure out what had happened to her, we were devastated. Not only because of what she went through, but because for SIX years, she had to carry that trauma with her, with no way of communicating that to anyone, no outlet.
As a female, I always passively considered myself a feminist, because for me, it was just a given to be supportive of equal rights for everyone. When I came to NYU, though, the self-proclaimed ""feminists"" that I met, encountered, and heard about, were so extremely ""vocal"" that there was no space to disagree with them without being called bigoted or an unconscious victim of the omnipresent system of patriarchy that they claim to exist and to pervade all walks of life, thus endlessly and unrelentingly oppressing all females by sheer default. At first, it caught me by surprise. But soon, it just started to offend me. In every possible way.
Marginalized groups should always have a voice. That's a given. Everyone with a story to tell should be able to present that narrative to the world so that a conversation can be started that has the potential to invoke serious change. The thing that I found with this new wave of feminism, however, is that their aim is not to reveal their narrative to start that conversation to start change. Whether it is intentional or unintentional, what they truly end up accomplishing when they ""give a voice to their cause"" is merely oppressing the voices of other subjugated groups. They witness a lingering environment of misogyny and suddenly declare it to be this transcendentally significant and urgent issue that needs to be everyone's focus so that everything can be fixed immediately. Now, I don't mean to generalize. I realize I keep saying ""they"" as if all feminists are the same types of people constantly throwing this type of temper tantrum to get the spotlight shown on their stories and ideas. I understand that not all ""feminists"" are like that, and I don't mean to attack anybody who assumes that identity. What shakes me to my core, though, is when the more radical feminists - the ones who are mistreated in the work place, or who are raped, or who feel that women are just treated unjustly altogether, and are thus compelled to hate all men and share their opinions on how awful they are - feel the need to use their ""voice"" so goddamn much that they can hardly talk about anything else, and who feel the need to twist everything they see into yet another injustice against them.
Yes, feminism is important. But when you spend all your time, shouting at the top of your lungs about how awful the world is and how much of a victim you are, you are not trying to incite change. You're only trying to gain recognition for what YOU feel is unfair. My sister was raped. I've been harassed by men. I've seen the lingering air of misogyny affecting things all over the place. But I still don't feel the urgent need to shove these experiences down everyone else's throat and say, ""HEY, I'M NOT BEING OBNOXIOUS, WE JUST DON'T GET ENOUGH RECOGNITION AND I'M JUST BEING THE RADICAL VOICE OF CHANGE THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS TO TOO IGNORANT TO HEAR""
You know what? Get over yourselves. Rape is bad. Patriarchy is bad. All these things are undeniably bad. But your narrative is NOT the only narrative there is to tell, and don't you dare let yourselves believe that YOUR narrative is under-recognized. What about my sister and the other people like her? What about THEIR voice? All of you guys (or girls, I should say), are so overwhelmingly vocal all the time, and you think that that's going to help things. But... spoiler alert! It's not doing a goddamn thing. You're marginalizing any other group of marginalized people who are the victims of other injustices. You're marginalizing my sister. You're marginalizing any victim of sexual assault who wasn't targeted merely because they were a woman. Because, in case you were too egocentric to realize it, victims of rape don't get raped just because they're girls. They're targeted because they appear vulnerable to the perpetrator in that moment. The proportion of the disabled population who are victims of sexual assault is shockingly higher than the proportion of women who are victims of sexual assault. And as I'm sure you know, men can be victims of sexual assault, too. IT'S NOT JUST YOU.
My intent in this secret is not to go on a tirade, or as new-wave feminists would call it, ""raise my voice"" for the cause of disability rights. My intent is to say that, just because you are a victim, doesn't mean that you have a right to ""raise your voice"" about it and assume that that will provoke change. Because you know what? It won't. Have your narrative, have your story. Tell your story. But have the humanity to recognize that OTHER people have their own narratives and their own stories, too. And give them space to let those be known as well.
So in NYU colloquial fashion, I will close by saying:

This isn't a secret. I would proclaim it to the world if I could. And I tried with pictures, but even a thousand words per picture isn't enough to convey this:
Since I was born, my mother put my sister and I before herself. She left everything she knew behind and moved to a country that was at first completely unwelcoming, where she had to learn everything for herself-from the language to buying a house. She left behind the career that was her passion, her family, and her financial stability so that my sister and I could have the world at our feet. As we grew, she stayed home with us while my father worked, helped us what homework she could, and attended every violin or ballet recital we ever had. She drove 2 hours every weekday so that my sister could train with the best synchronized swimming team in the nation, all the while studying to obtain her real estate license, and working from her laptop in the car as she waited for the 4-hour practices to end. When my sister moved away to train for the Olympics, she would drive the 6 hours to and from San Francisco 3 times a month to work the team fundraiser to pay for her trips around the world. When I left for college, I left her behind with my father's degenerative Parkinson's, my sister's intensive training schedule, and the bills through the roof.
My mother could never edit my english essays, my cover letter, or my resumes. She couldn't tell me how to study for the SAT, the ACT, or how to apply to college. When I was younger my classmates would ask my why she talked funny, and why she didn't get TV references.
But my mother is what every girl in the world should aspire to be. Because she is the glue that holds me together. She is the fuel that wakes me up at ungodly hours, and chains me to Bobst every weekend. She planted my family in the United States 17 years ago, and she has fought every single second of every single day to keep us growing in every way possible. I hope everyone has the fortune to have a woman like her in their lives, who will stop at nothing to bring happiness to the people she loves.""","#2011: ""Four months ago, I wrote on this page about how I was getting into Medical School, or would die trying.

That said, it takes a great deal of willpower to not censor a lot of the shitty things that people say. Please try to remember that, even though you're responding to ""just a number,"" the person behind that number is probably reading what you write. This page is meant to engender community at NYU, not divide us more. I'd really love it if we could keep up the great thing we have going here.
Second--I think there's a misconception that I post every secret I receive. I've seen pages who post everything they get and they're, for the most part, not pretty. I simply cannot post everything--either this page would devolve into news feed spam or I'd be about a month behind on posting secrets.
Third--I'm aware that some things I post are not secrets per se. I'm actually okay with this if I think the post has otherwise an important message or is something worth sharing. Similarly, I am also okay with posting secrets from non-students if they are still about NYU.
Lastly, I want to thank you guys for helping me build such a strong community here. Between the articles that have been written, the feedback I've gotten, and the way people react, I think what we're doing is really great for the university.

This is to every pre-med kid who sent in a suicidal/self-doubting/self-loathing secret, second guessing their career of choice, and if you're metaphorical enough with it, I suppose it can also extrapolate to others with challenging undergraduate programs.
I will tell you as the creator of the Henssler Meme (#OrgoJoke) that you should tell anyone who tells you you're inadequate, or encourages you to drop out to respectfully FUCK THEMSELVES.
Because being a doctor is about two things:
1. Knowing how to deal with the pressure that classes, cases, attendings etc. throw at you, but also and perhaps more importantly,
2. NEVER stopping to get what you want. Think about how many doctors exist. Do you think that all of them breezed through Orgo or Molec the first time through? I can tell you from asking every physician I've ever visited about their undergraduate experience that they didn't. I have had my advisor tell me countless times that I should look into alternative carreers, blah blah. I tell her I'll think about it to shut her up but inside all I'm doing is counting down the minutes until the appointment is over so I can go perform animal brain surgery in my research lab.
Being a doctor is a game. And part of that game, is getting so close to quitting that the true test of strength is whether or not you had what it took to get up, and not let anything or anyone tell you that ""maybe it's time for you to stop"".
I've wanted to be a neurosurgeon since I was 9 years old, my GPA isn't perfect, and Orgo destroyed me physically, emotionally, and socially, but I can perform electrolytic and pharmacological lesions on live (anesthetized) rats at 20 years old. So excuse me if I'm not going to let one possible class retake tell me that I don't have what it takes. I AM pre-med. And I'm not going anywhere.
Finally, in the words of the pre-med bible show Grey's Anatomy: ""Each of you comes in today hopeful, wanting in on the game. The 7 years you spend here will be the best and worst of your life. You'll be pushed to the breaking point. 8 of you will switch to an easier specialty. 5 of you will crack under pressure. 2 of you will be asked to leave. This is your starting line.

I'm an international student from Korea. English is my second language. Sometimes when I participate in class discussions I misuse articles or say something that sounds awkward in English, but sounds perfectly normal when expressed in Korean. Even as I type this message, I'm afraid I'm making grammatical mistakes.
When I make mistakes, some kids in my class would laugh. They make fun of me (from behind, but I can still hear them) imitating my accent .
But the thing is :
(A) I have smarter things to say than at least half of the class. I'm not being arrogant. I'm simply stating the truth. Many kids skim through the reading materials. They discreetly brag about how LESS they invested on reading before the class starts: ""I dunno. .. like.. I skipped thru most part...I mean.. I couldn't be bothered.. I was so stoned last night ..""
I invested 4 hours reading that same material looking up English-Korean dictionary at least two times per page. No wonder I have so much to say during class discussions despite my clumsy English.
(B) Most kids in my class cannot speak a foreign language at the level of my fluency in English.
Also, my roommate thinks she is somehow cooler than I am because she takes her grades far less seriously than I do. I respect her choices. I hope she shows the same respects to my priorities as well.
Yes, ""most"" Korean kids take their grades seriously than ""most"" kids at NYU. But please take note of this : Most of my Korean friends, including myself, take grades seriously not because we were raised to consider A=success in life, but because we actually care A LOT about the stuff that we study at NYU. We flew all the way from K-Land, paying MORE tuition.
So whenever your fellow English as-Second-Language Student (aka ESL students) participate in class discussions.. show some respect by paying attention to what she is trying to get across rather than petty grammatical mistakes she makes. Also, stop judging your (okay, maybe a little nerdy) Korean roommates who seem to study way harder than you think it is necessary.

Even though I love my sister more than life itself, I hated being there and I moved away. When I finally did, I had never felt so alone in my life. It seemed like people were always watching my every move; I had to dress up to impress people, and every day was more difficult than the last. Everyone I met was cutthroat. I swear everyone was out to get me. My only true friend was a younger girl who reminded me of my sister. After she died, I became reacquainted with a boy I'd gone to elementary school with. Eventually he told me he was in love with me, and even though I didn't feel the same way, I felt trapped.

I swear everyone was out to get me. My only true friend was a younger girl who reminded me of my sister. After she died, I became reacquainted with a boy I'd gone to elementary school with.

He's an amazing guy, however and shows me he loves in in various ways daily, but I can't help but think that he'll fall in love with the city life and forget about me. We miss each other so much, but sometimes I feel like I miss him more. I love everything about New York City and can't wait to attend school there next year. I hope I don't sound like a jealous bitch, but it just sucks being apart from your boyfriend who's basically your best friend of years whilst watching him enjoy a new life with new people.

Holy moly, this thing is incredible and funny, but some of these secrets are totally heartbreaking. Some of you freshmen and sophomores (which I'm assuming a lot of
you are, given that you haven't gotten out of/been systematically removed from the dorms yet
and are still intimidated by the trendy Koreans in Bobst) are really struggling. Here's the real secret: This school, this city and the extreme combination of the two are not for everyone. New York City will break you; it will chew you up, spit you out and Kanye shrug on the daily. Your dorms will barely suffice as a safe haven, and this school will absolutely not hold your hand. You see, there's no break from it: there's no super cozy student-run lounge, or fences around the quad to keep the noise outside.
A homeless person may/may not threaten to eat your face as you try to sunbathe and read Foucault in WSP.
We don't really have enough sports teams or fraternities or people who care about that shit for you to have colors to hide behind, or mascots to help guide you in the shaping of your identity. A quarter of your floor freshmen year may or may not end up in rehab, or the psych ward, or the wellness center, or back home. You may feel inclined to join them. You will at some point feel lonely. You will
wonder if this city and this school is for you. For some of you, it isn't. What's important is that you figure that out right away, before you land yourself in thousands of dollars of debt or completely break your family's bank. Don't feel shame in accepting and realizing that you're not where you need to be right now. Go and be happy.
For those of you who choose to stay: It gets better. Not to sound like Glee, but it does. This university has amazing scholars and professionals teaching at it, willing to use this city to help give you a learning experience you will never get anywhere else. And they do give a damn, believe it or not! You just have to find them. Does your random general studies department at CAS suck? Then switch to another school! Take other classes, be creative. Check out
SCA, or transfer to MCC in Steinhardt like everyone else does. Switch your studio and join the crazies at ETW, or become one of the Gallatin elite. The good thing about NYC and NYU is that there is absolutely a place for you here, you just have to find it. It wont be easy and is kind of like the easter egg hunt from hell, but once you find it you will be happy. This place will become home and in four years, you're going to be in Yankee Stadium or Radio City Music Hall or some other iconic New York venue and realizing that you graduated NYU and you graduated NYC. You're a true ""violet"" and a hell of a New Yorker, and you are only stronger for it. So chin the fuck up, keep procrastinating those papers, stay jacked up on Redbull in LL1 and cry a little here and there. You're gonna be alright and you're gonna make it and it's gonna be worth it.

Of course, on Christmas Day you're out of the house all day visiting family, so the true best day of the year for a little kid was December 26th, when you could actually play with all the good shit Santa's fat ass brought you. So I woke up at like 7am the day after Christmas and ran downstairs to get my rasslin' on. I must've played nonstop for around 3 hours (my family is still asleep) before I noticed I really had to go to the bathroom. But I was way too busy beating the shit out of people as Stone Cold Steve Austin. So I held it in. Finally I reached a checkpoint and was able to save the game. I really really really had to go now, so I took a break and ran upstairs to the bathroom. And when I pulled down my pants, I realized that my once virgin snow pure white tightie whities were now soiled a thick chocolate fudge sludgey brown. Yes, I had shat my pants at the age of 9, all in the name of Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, The Undertaker, and other assorted wrestling legends of my childhood. Everyone was still asleep and I didn't know what to do. I was panicking and the only thing I could think of was to yell for my dad. Somehow he heard me, and somehow no one else was woken up, perhaps it was divine providence. He came down and I explained my situation through a crack in the door. He went back upstairs and brought down a fresh pair of clean briefs, passing it to me with the door cracked open. I wiped the excess shit off my ass and put on the underwear. But now, what were we going to do with the dirty pair? Our solution was to bury it in the garbage can under a pile of excess toilet paper. With the harrowing task completed, I looked into my father's eyes and he knew.
