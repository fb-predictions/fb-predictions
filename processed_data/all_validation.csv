At university, and at all universities, students are in an isolated bubble and seem to forget that they are part of a larger world with more problems than assignments, your next exam, that one hot guy, that perfect girl, etc. One of the biggest issues right now is Syrian refugee crisis (you've been living under a rock if you haven't heard about it). Countries can't even seem to figure out a cohesive solution to approach the problem. Everyone is so wrapped up in themselves that no one seems to remember that these are people with basic needs. But you can help.
Kickstarter recently launched a campaign to aid the Syrian refugees through the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). They are waiving all fees (except credit card charges) so all donations go directly to the UNHCR and you will not need a Kickstarter account to help out. All your donations are 100% tax deductible and would go to help someone in need. Please consider giving at: hyperlink

I was so taken aback by the eye contact we made on Comm Ave that I thought one of the buttons on my coat was left open. The zipper is broken so I have to button it up all throughout winter. I was about to go up the stairs to StuVi one and heard someone yelling ""excuse me"" only to see that it was you. It all happened so fast so I don't remember everything you said but I do remember that you told me I looked very elegant. I was so nervous and I did not know what to say or even how to thank you for the compliment, so all I said was that I am taken by someone else. Even though this is true, I wish I had handled the situation differently or at least gotten your name. I have fantasized about this exact situation happening to me and I can't believe things like this really happen outside of movies. As soon as I stepped into my apartment, I turned right back around and went downstairs to see if you were still there. Of course, you were gone.

I watched the first video because I was glad that they were getting the word out and attempting to lessen the stigmatization of mental illness. What I wasn't happy about is how they portrayed anxiety. Sure, you can get anxious about a test or homework or grades or anything really; that's normal. But that's not what an mental illness (like an anxiety disorder) is like. It's not stressing about one thing and then feeling relieved when it's over; it's uncontrollable worrying and stress that actually interferes with a persons ability to function on a day-to-day basis. It's the constant feeling that says something bad will happen, you'll fail, you'll fuck up, even when you're doing everything right.

I feel like I have to put in extra effort to be clean, well-dressed, and carry myself well because I don't want to perpetuate any of the ""Indians are dirty/poor/trashy"" stereotypes. No one realizes how a country of 1.23 billion people is going to produce an immensely wide spectrum of people. It also bothers me when my friends make fun of the ""Indian"" accent (there are multiple accents all across India and not a single white person can get any of them right) and dance weirdly by shaking their heads and giggle about it. I understand cracking jokes about stereotypes - hell, in India, there are people that mock the American accent and the obesity problems in this country, etc. - but I think that they cross the line into offensive. Don't get me wrong, they're great people and I am glad I met them, but I wish people in this country were more accepting of foreign cultures than weirded out by things they don't understand. I have a feeling that this post will get attacked as well by people that don't realize that they are being offensive when they are. I wish I could talk about how awesome India is and how warm our people really are. But I suppose I would end up talking at uninterested walls.

As some of you may know, an university first year student died by suicide this afternoon. It's hard to know what to say when heartbreaking instances like this happen, but here's what I hope you all (especially any freshmen reading this) know.
Starting college and adjusting to adult life can be so hard, alienating, and lonely, especially if you're just moving to NYC and don't have an established support system. Classes are hard and it's so easy to put performing academically above your health. Periods of transition in life are always really stressful, and it's important to check in with yourself and your friends to make sure you're handling big changes in a way that respects our mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing. Just remember that you're not alone and that you are loved.

I didn’t think I’d be able to live the life I have now - stable, calm. And I don’t feel numb, I still feel like me - just without the mood instability, without waking up feeling like it hurts just to be alive.
I’ve seen at least six psychiatrists prior to my current one, and all of them had long waits for initial appointments and difficult availabilities, especially for students.
But now, I just started med school and in about 6.5 years, I’ll be a psychiatrist.
People think of MDs physically saving people. But I wish more recognized the importance of mental health and that people are dying because they don’t have access to necessary care. Hell, most of the time, therapists refer you to a psychiatrist. But actually getting in to see one and feeling comfortable enough with them and their ability to listen and work with you in an actual team effort... well that’s nearly impossible right now.

The amount of time I spend on vapid busywork OVERWHELMINGLY outweighs the amount of time I get to spend with my floor, who I sense is now pretty disconnected as a result of me being often absent due to the enormous pressure I'm under. To be honest, I have never been so unhappy at this school, but I'm sort of locked into this job due to my family's low income (university literally costs more than they make in a year). The only things that keep me sane are the handful of residents who actually attend my programs and my amazing/kind/funny coworkers.

The times you sacrificed study time to check in with a friend youre worried about, and the time you spend just trying to arrange plans to meet up. This is for you.

Where they value your love and care and return it as well. If theres a ""friendship"" or any relationship in your life where you dont feel like you are valued in, drop it. Sure, you might think youre ok with it now, but when push comes to pull, they arent going to be there for you when you have a bad day or do poorly on an exam.

I’m graduating high school, and university got the last laugh as my tuition fees are used to develop drugs that cure parasitic infections. I cannot be a parasite for much longer...

It has been a strange week.
Reasons why:
1. I mistakenly recycled a pen in ""Paper"" instead of ""Plastics.""
2. I was in the washroom washing my hands after doing my business, when I glanced in the mirror and saw urinals. With surprise I thought ""Oh! university has a co-ed washroom?"" Then a guy walked into the washroom and our eyes met in the mirror for a split second and in that second I knew: I was in the men's washroom. I glanced at myself in the mirror hoping that perhaps I could pass for a guy but nope, I definitely look like a girl. I glanced at the guy, who was smiling but not looking at me. I furiously finished washing my hands and almost ran into a guy coming in on my way out. To the men using the urinals: I did not see anything I swear.
Now I am safely at home where there is one bathroom and I can easily correct my recycling errors.",1516204800.0,128,22,0,179,"Like,Haha,Love",2018,1,2,8,2.0943951023931953,0.9330127018922194,0.2500000000000001,0,0,1,Vancouver,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20797.671114397897,201,0.009664543635409778,171,866,1,0,0.092,0.108,0.8,2.8958333333333335,2.7372549019607844,0.7112821338290214,2

Youre right, no one does care how their profs day has been, and you certainly dont tell coop company interview that you only care about getting a coop job + getting paid. but when you dont have real interest in something, if you want to establish a relationship you gotta fake it.

idk what it is about the math building but because I stay there sometimes, I've heard people say multiple times throughout the year that the toilet is overflowing. Something is going on there I swear. I've never heard of the male bathroom having similar problems but we really need a new math building. Also does it hurt that much to have warm water for hand washing...
Other times I have cpsc labs in the icics building. The male bathroom smells like people pee on the walls, or maybe they should design better algorithms for urinal flushing. It literally smells just as bad right after cleaning.
When I'm at ikb I avoid going to the bathrooms there, it's a high population density area with less than optimal sized bathroom. But nice design at the bottom of the door so I can open it without using my hands (please add to more locations).
At the end, I know this isn't happening but can we try to leave the next paper towel hanging out? If the dispenser requires spinning to eject the paper towel, will you kindly help to get the next piece out of the dispenser using your used paper towel?

university is, apparently, home to a seemingly huge number of rude, poorly raised and honestly disgusting guys.

One day, it wasn't just the sun; a new beast came in its wake, rearing its ugly head to proclaim its arrival. One by one the people locked themselves in. Women and children shrieked in terror as the beast run rampant across the land, its long and terrible claws cutting down people like flies, as it moved across the country. university, the prison of the northwestern coast, shut down; their great and glorious leader Santa Ono had abandoned the site as soon as the beast had appeared. Blind and terrified, the prisoners escaped the prison, never to return again.

I was playing ukulele on campus when a random ass dude came up to me and asked me if he could play my uke right in the middle of a song I was playing.

Now I was hanging out with my stoner friends so there was a bunch of pizza coupons lying on the ground. The dude then picked up the pizza coupons and shoved them into my personal space saying he'd exchange for my uke. At this point, I was completely annoyed and my space was being invaded. I kept telling him no, eventually he got impatient and gave up thankfully. But before he left, he then said that once I was done to come find him so he could play.
First off, FUCK YOU! You are not fucking entitled to my ukulele or any of my possessions for that matter. You do not fucking ask to play my instrument when I'm right in the middle of playing a song.

Hi, how is it going? Actually, I don’t really care because you’re probably too busy partying to even respond – Just like in the project group chat! Anyways, here are some suggestions that I highly recommend you to follow in the future when you’re working in a group project:
1) Please don’t say that you’re okay with an idea and then change it at the very last minute. It’s very annoying, just like you.
2) Don’t use that “I didn’t see your message” bullcrap. Newsflash, Facebook messenger shows whether you have seen the chat or not. Lying is not a good look for you sweetie.
3) When you asked me to check your work at 3:00 AM in the morning, when the due date was literally within a few hours, I was close to crying. I may have a kink for vampires but that doesn’t mean I don’t like my sleep. Please ask ahead of time.
4) Be a decent human being. Don’t scroll through your Instagram feed when someone is speaking to you. Show some respect.
What I’m trying to say is… You disappointed me, so please don’t drag your future unfortunate partners down and create more victims due to your inconsiderate acts.

And even if I did they ended up being commuters that don't wanna come back up onto campus to hang out or do anything really. For the most part people in res don't even talk to each other so it gets pretty lonely. Yup people just go back into their rooms without even saying hi to each other... The concrete structures don't help with the mood either and everything is all squished together! Why on earth was a uni built on a mountain? (Look at other universities most of them are spacious , angry.) university would've been fine on the mountain if there was some social life here. The school is pretty bad at planning social events and where are allll the parties at?

Hello, I have confession to make. With all the rapes things going on in university residences. I was physically abused when I was a 1st year at university residences. They said that they couldn't do anything unless I made a report to the rcmp. I made a report and nothing happened within residences. He keep living on campus, going to Dh and they did nothing. Then residence gave me a level 5 for no reason and said that I manage wrongly the situation. I always thought that they gave it to me because I called the police and that was bad advertisement for university reslife. Through out my time at residences I have seen girls been abused and come to me to ask for her because they know res life don't do anything. I am mad for the rapes at residence because they could have prevented! They should stop spending time busting people for drinking in the common room or smoking outside he building and do something about physical abuse!!!!",1466303000.0,22,9,0,45,"Like,Angry,Sad",2016,6,5,19,5.074544800173513,0.03243239515699409,0.6771455189988577,0,0,1,Vancouver,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8271.66339681533,54,0.006528312070917988,171,923,1,0,0.158,0.006,0.835,2.8958333333333335,2.9607843137254903,-0.420875734948013,1

Eat arugula. Do you feel ugly and undervalued by your new university friends? Eat arugula. Are you too shy to ask that boy/girl out? Eat arugula. There are several reasons for this. Not only does it keep you happy(tool against depression) by giving you the power to shit whenever you want, but it also gives you more confidence because we all know that a bloody anus is the worst. After a while, you'll also become more attractive cuz trust me people are much nicer and much more open when they realize you don't eat dogs, but eats arugula instead. You will also get that number when you say I don't have sex with other humans, but I have sex with apache helicopters....

It has come to our attention that you are being sought after by the cricket-playing rugby rejects of Cardiff AKA the brown boys.

Firstly, defrosting their mum’s butter chicken does not count as cooking and secondly don’t let their STEM degree mask the fact that they can’t engineer a connecting beard. On the bright side though, they really won’t be able to give you chlamydia because they’ve never actually got that far.

The next morning, I bought it up with him and he answered me clearly and concisely -

This is a hard confession to make, but I have been witness to multiple and continuous thefts of food by my closest friends in my flat, stealing food when others aren’t in the kitchen by simply sticking their hand in and grabbing what isn’t theirs from my other flatmates’ cooking or fridge items, gobbling down the contents with the fridge door ajar. I believe this to be revolting and unacceptable (which I have told the thiefs) and yet the finger-sticking-in-and-licking continues exponentially with no sign of stopping.
I came here to ask whether I should expose these snack-snatchers, these pasta-pickers, these goody-grabbers, to the affected flatmates, or whether I should remain tight lipped while this heartless and quite frankly selfish treachery continues.

1303,"Fish and Chip reviews - Cathay’s Fish Bar
A little known fact is that in Ronald Reagan’s famous speech about the shinning city on the hill speech actually refers not to the United States but to Cathays fish bar “whose beacon light guides freedom-loving people everywhere.”
Unfortunately freedom in this case is the freedom to make poor life’s choices, like eating at Cathays fish bar.
Like America ,Cathays Fish Bar’s portions are oversized, unhealthy and (judging by how greasy the fish is) can only be sustained by exploiting oil rich nations.
However there are a few positives to Cathays fish bar, the food is cheap, the chips are decent and unlike Khan’s fish bar they have haddock (which is better than cod if you disagree then start your own fish and chip focused media empire.)
Overall this adds up to a thoroughly average eating experience to which I attribute a 5/10

This message was passed on from Durham police who have said it is in breach of the lockdown rules. The rules state that you may only move addresses for exceptional circumstances like work, domestic abuse or child care issues: I don't think 'celebrating the end of the year at uni' would come under one of those exceptional circumstances. I understand we are all gutted that we can't be in Durham at arguably the best point in the year, and as a finalist I am extra upset this can't happen. However, it's so upsetting to see students blatantly ignoring this so they can have some fun with their friends and are willing to put the local population at risk to do so.

'edgy peeps' - pretty self-explanatory; think that if they keep taking pictures with an analog it will make them original (everyone does it Daisy, grow up), probably have instagrams with their artwork and/or makeup

Hey guys,
First of all, thank you to the people who have sent us feedback! At the moment you're engaging with Durfess' more than ever - around 200,000 times per week - and we need your help to make sure that we catch the hate speech that some people insist on posting in our comments and hidden in Durfess submissions.
Our moderators try extremely hard to make sure that what gets posted meets a positive standard but obviously we make mistakes. If you see any posts that you think shouldn't have been published, or if you see comments spouting hate and making Durfess a less pleasant place for students to engage with then we'd really appreciate it if you let us know.
You can highlight these issues to us in any of the following ways (in order of the average response time):
1. Inboxing the page on Facebook (Usually <10mins)
2. Emailing the page (durfess.legal@gmail.com) [Usually <6h]
3. Sending an anonymous submission to the page (Usually <24h)
Again, a huge thank you to the people who have taken the time to help us make Durfess a better and more engaging place - it means a lot!

351,"A real confession here: this year has made me totally ashamed to be a member of castle. We were given a principal who actually cared about the welfare of students and the entirety of the jcr took to mocking him on Facebook groups and did all they could to get rid of him. Drinking culture is an issue in Durham, its an issue everywhere - people drinking till they puke or can't walk is not healthy for the individual, and for people who don't drink and arnt used to seeing people in that state it can be a really disturbing experience. The first term of this year was the first instance in my 3 years at Durham of feeling safe when going to college events but the student body, who always claim to put welfare first, would rather be able to drink until they blackout than do anything about it.
At the end of the day what you put in your body is your own choice but belittling someone who was genuinely trying to help is just ridiculous! If you want to do that to yourself then go ahead but you shouldn't expect the college to idly let that happen.

If anyone has any advice, please help me, I don’t want to get to the end of uni feeling like I’m desperate for something to happen but haven’t got the confidence to make it happen.",1529081804.0,4,1,0,12,"Sad,Like,Love",2018,6,4,17,4.694935687864747,7.615242180436521e-05,0.49127379678135824,0,1,0,London,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,10090.041778852767,13,0.0012883990259828335,169,875,1,0,0.118,0.203,0.679,2.8541666666666665,2.772549019607843,-0.2565223799083236,0

187,"The two are completely different based on circumstances. The point is that police are supposed to be a public service employed by the government to protect the people, paid by our money. But the systematic racism and protections within the police department protect officers who incite violence, racially profile and murder members of the public. Other cops have the power to stop it while it's happening, and then also have the power to hold the offending officer accountable after the fact. But this is rarely done.
Replacing cops with Muslims or protesters is not the same sentiment since protesters and Muslims are not public service workers and don't have power over both the public and other members of the same group or religion.

183,"In the 1st year Law class there are 4 distinct groups:
The Cabinet: First four rows, attend every single lecture, buy every textbook, swarm around the lecturer with notes and questions. Quintessential first-benchers in school, they arrive between 10-20 minutes early to get the best seats and save two more for their ""gang gang"". High chance of actually getting a first.
The Commoners: The middle part of the theatre, attending lectures is an obligation: they sit half zoned out typing away into an editable lecture handouts doc until they give up 20 minutes in. Make up 95% of the Law Ball first year attendance and post shiny pictures on the gram. Might pull off a first.
The Graduates: Always in the back corners of the lecture theatre. Usually North American and are the only people to scream out the answers to the rather rhetorical questions of the lecturer. Seem ancient and distant, seldom to be seen in Hive or Atik. First year actually counts for them rip.
The Backbenchers: Pop up at lectures once in a while, completely zoned out, have crocs and pajamas on. ""i cba"".

62,"So I’m a Leeds fan and I’m happy that leeds are going up. But I was just told that you can’t be mad about the football celebrations in Leeds when I wasn’t mad about the BLM protests.
Let me just explain why I can be mad about this.
Football celebrations are celebrations, their aim is not to change anything, you can have those celebrations in a smaller settings. You can’t do this with a protest.
Additionally all the pictures of the blm protests people were sober, socially distanced and most were wearing masks. At these football celebrations you can see drunk strangers hugging each other, during a pandemic. Not okay.
And finally, there is a shift in power here. The people who attended the BLM protests (families, POC etc) were treated with hostility by police and the media. The majority of football fans are white men, police let these celebrations happen, the media are referring to these white men as just ‘enjoying themselves’. Not saying they are risking lives, that it’s unnecessary or hooliganism, phrases they used to describe the BLM protesters that were calling for change, for something that really matters.

I've been using them for 2 years now and have really got to understand the benefits of them in comparison to tampons and pads.
I understand they're not for everyone but they definitely have a lot of good qualities! For example:
- They usually only need changing in the morning and before bed (a lot less maintenance than alternatives)
- They're reusable. Most can last from 5-10 years. THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU CAN SAVE! One cup costs £20 but just think of it as a long term investment. Also this means they are way better for the environment too! It's a win-win!
- They're better for your body. Tampons are often bleached meaning chemicals are entering your bodies and harming them! By using a cup there are less toxic substances going into your body, leading to less chance of infections!
- They reduce the chance of toxic shock syndrome
- You can still go swimming when you wear a cup! In fact, you're less likely to leak using a cup than a tampon
- People worry about not being able to insert the cup properly but it is a lot easier than it seems! It's a very flexible material and sometimes it just takes a little practice at first and getting used to - trust me!

I understand there must be fear to speak out even in the UK but I strongly believe we need to stand up against the CCP and with the people of Hong Kong. Perhaps through demonstrations on campus.
This is also of great importance as the CCP is getting a greater hold of uni’s here in the UK and forcing universities to do their bidding, which i encourage others to research.",1594147985.0,188,6,0,211,"Like,Love,Haha",2020,7,1,19,5.205444494073087,0.05955463089730706,0.7366598335924214,0,1,0,London,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,30273.26225037345,217,0.007168041495010109,123,692,1,0,0.031,0.157,0.812,1.8958333333333333,2.0549019607843135,1.5677294000118527,2

They’re talking of a second wave in August now, right when I will no longer have to shield. It’s clearly the governments fault for lifting restrictions too early (practically all virologists say it is too early) but when people you know well can’t even make tiny sacrifices to give me a chance at some sort of normal life eventually really pisses me off. However having said all this at the same time I’m conflicted, part of me wants people to just mingle as much as possible so we can get some natural immunity going.

First of all, the reason you stopped going into uni and can't get back into it is probably a bit to do with anxiety, so take some time to look after yourself. Have a day where you have orange juice and lots of vitamins, do any washing up and cleaning, wash your bedding, shower, and put nice fresh clothes on. Get some ABBA on while you do it to keep you pumped.
Pack a bag the night before with everything you need, and write a list of what you'll do in the morning step by step, e.g. eat pancakes, brush teeth, get dressed, set off
In the morning, get up as soon as your alarm goes off and follow your list.
If you're still struggling, reach out to your tutor, lecturer, or friends and ask them to help encourage you.

355,"Advice pls. Should I message my friend who has a girlfriend (just to check-in)?
One of my friends has been quiet on the group chat. It's a big group chat with lots of people in, so it's not that odd that he's been so silent. Still, given the circumstances I kind of want to check-in to see how he is and make sure he's alright.
My dilemma is that he has a girlfriend, also in the group. I actually knew her first, and only really came to know him as a result of knowing her. I never normally message him, but I would normally see him around uni, and obviously, I can't do that now.
I'm pretty sure his girlfriend wouldn't care but I'm worried it will make him uncomfortable if I message him. I'm not interested in sliding into him DMs, but I'm concerned he'll worry that's what I'm doing. I just want him to know that his friends care about him.
I'm 100% overthinking this but would appreciate others' input, especially if you're in a relationship.

- The local, it’s not for students and you’ve got to respect that.
6) Old Grindstone
- Decent after the renovation, could be livelier but the pool tables are always available which is good.
5) The Closed Shop
- A good venue, very nice food. Beer garden is a bit small but it’s a lovely place for a nice pint.
4) The Springvale
- A good venue which is always lively, if a bit cramped when there’s a match on. Are the cheap pints worth the walk back up Springvale Road though?
3) Hally House
- Name another pub with as good a selection of board games. The range of pints available is great too. A well deserved 3rd place.
2) The Ball
- The gentrified Grindstone, good pints and good food. Lively, especially on quiz night.
1) Cobden View

Tell that its owner well his audience read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless ket-heads,
The nose that snorted, and the mouth that drank;
And on the doors, these words appear:

I just thought that this is just my experience anyway.
Unfortunately I’ve come across people who have experienced very similar ignorant attitudes.

You do realise that there are other ethnicities we could belong to for example:
Middle Eastern, Israeli, Arab, Iranian, Turkey, North African Arab countries too, South American; Brazilian, Colombian, Central Asian; Mongolia, Kyrgyz, Uzbekistan, Afghani, South East Asian; Indonesian, Burmese, Thai, Malaysian, Philippines, Sri Lankan, Nepalese etc

116,"Hey, no offence. But Don’t you think that your behaviour is selfish and inconsiderate to your friend and her bf? She deserves to have her stable and committed love for a longer period to hopefully make her family with her man. Your behaviour is nothing other than intervening her relationship and sticking around her by taking advantage of ‘the friend frame between guys and girls’. If you were a real just friend, then when your female friend has a bf, don’t contact her necessarily. Rather refrain from contacting. Just pray for her to live well, which is a righteous gesture. Your needs of wanting her at least as a friend (in your term) cannot be a justification to intervene them. Please remember that you are also a man. Do fair play for her bf and her. Behave with integrity.
Believe in yourself. Live your life. A life long friend will come to your life. The person could be your friend or your future partner.

It's certainly not the Chinese in Wuhan who sold the infected animals at the animal market because their intention wasn't to spread the virus (plus they had no idea if the animals were even infected). But can someone plzzzz tell me why in the fucking universe is a BAT ORIGINATED VIRUS infecting other animals in the first place????? Wtf are they even selling in this animal market???? God knows what type of nasty shit that's going on in this market but let me remind you that same shit has happened in early 2000s with SARS epidemic from the bats. So many have died from SARS and yet these Chinese animal markets STILL haven't mf learned to not fuck with the bats. And if another epidemic starts from China in the future from the bats???

1382,"This is not Berkeley related but I just have to get it off my chest. Unions are evil. *Modern* unionized labor is just another form of racial oppression. Many unions have a system which favors those who have seniority, not those who are the most qualified. They may preach inclusiveness and diversity and they may even back bills that demand diversity in work places, but when it comes down to it, those in power are those who have been loyal to the system for the longest. In other words, since racial discrimination was at its worst only a few decades ago (it’s still there but it’s clearly improving in many industries), minorities with the most professional qualifications are often mostly in the younger generations. However because of unions, oppressed minorities face compounded institutionalized racism as they are often not favored by the unions pretending to protect them due to their lack of seniority. This means when budget cuts roll around, old white folks (who probably can’t even operate their iPhone let alone the computer they need for their job) keep their position but younger more vulnerable and more diverse workers get the axe.
Remember, unions are the ones that pushed for the whole protection from that “age-ism” bullshit just to keep unproductive dinosaurs from losing their jobs.",1547703000.0,8,9,0,21,"Like,Haha,Wow",2019,1,2,21,5.6286868376817125,0.19561928549563956,0.8966766701456175,1,0,0,Los_Angeles,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12703.530265778043,30,0.0023615482761368154,217,1306,1,0,0.182,0.072,0.746,3.8541666666666665,4.462745098039216,-0.020303336926472366,0

However, I've come across people that instantly snapped at me or became rude to me before I even had a chance to apologize. I guess I'm confused as to whether the only thing that matters is how my words are received, or if my intent plays any role in how acceptable my words are. I just wish that someone was more patient and educated me when I was first trying to understand preferred pronouns and gender identity instead of just snapping back and getting angry.

A little over a week ago, I was hospitalized for having a panic attack after deciding I wanted to kill myself. They put me in a psych unit, of course, and I spent several meaningless days there taking new medications and being mentally evaluated like some subhuman prisoner. The thing is, medication hasn’t worked for me in the past. I feel like I’m slowly descending into a truly empty existence. Maybe it’s already empty. I don’t know why I’m writing this. I guess I’ll say, I don’t blame Cal or CoE, even though it would be so easy to after meeting a few other Cal students in the hospital. Berkeley didn’t do this to me, though. I also don’t blame “the hand I was dealt with.” I was worthless long before having to endure any part of the last couple years here. The only person to blame is myself. I think I might’ve accidentally chosen to stop caring about myself or what happens to me along the way. I was going to ask for help but it doesn’t seem worthwhile anymore. I hope this confession is a weird cry for help because that would be some evidence of me caring, right? I can’t tell anymore.

Can we talk about something really important??
Let's stop minimizing abuse experienced among us Asians. Really, for all races, but the stigma around physical and emotional abuse is ridiculous.

I know a lot of us grew up being slapped or hit with other things, but it doesn't mean we should invalidate what we've been through, or that much of that was likely traumatizing.
I have opened up to friends before, and they would either deny that it has happened to me, or say ""oh, but all of us grew up with it.""
I understand that for some people, it stopped at a certain age, or it never really bothered them.
But still, it's fucking real for some of us. I'm not asking for you to say anything really, I'm just asking you to accept it, accept how it's changed me, and NOT deny it. I hate the fucking stigma that if we open up about it, we're being dramatic or something.

Trump very well could win this election.
But that didn’t break me. I was not broken.
Until my sister told me, in excruciating detail, that she just tried to kill herself.
She won’t even let me see her. She’s getting help, and she’s safe for now, but there’s absolutely nothing I can do. Whenever I try anything, she gets angry and defensive.
God knows she’s not perfect. But she is the only, only thing in this world that I love more than my own life. I would happily give mine up, if that meant she would want hers again.

363,"Tips on how to be friends with an ex by a girl who is friends with all of her exes, and even set two of them up with other friends:
1. Understand that you're under no obligation to stay friends. Be sure that it's what you want
2. Take some time after the break up to heal and recover. Don't talk for 2-3 weeks, just to get over the initial pain. Make sure that when you come back, being friends is what you both want
3. Make sure you're not staying friends with them just in the hopes you'll get back together. This can turn toxic and usually ends in tears
4. Don't view them as 'your ex that you're friends with'. If you do, the fact you have a history will always taint your friendship. They should be your friend first and foremost, and the fact you dated should be something laughed and jokes about

I for one as a Hickling resident, and I also speak for many others in my flat, do not come from a rich family. I will leave here with the same debt and job prospects as the rest of all of my fellow students, and that's all that counts. Whoever made the comment about working hard for money clearly doesn't understand how the world works as the majority of my friends are scraping the barrel when they work insane hours AND have university degrees. This university though is a new environment for all of us, where our backgrounds don't matter but our academic ability AND work ethic does.

All of my sexual encounters have been when I have been blackout drunk, and most I barely even remember. When I think of seeing any of those guys again I feel scared and don’t want to see them - one of which was in one of my seminars - and I felt uncomfortable when I was around them. I know consent wise someone who is blackout drunk cannot consent, but also I don’t feel like it is assault? Because it’s not like I didn’t want to have sex? And they were drunk too... but recently I’ve been thinking of my pervious sexual experiences (quarantine got us all a bit more obsessed with sex) and I feel like I’ve not had a good experience, and honestly I don’t think I could have sex with anyone unless I was really drunk.

1991,Sorry but are people actually seriously equating the height thing with being size 6 like wtf. I would never want to make someone feel insecure about their height and don’t think it should be a massive factor in attraction but it’s not as risky a thing to encourage. People develop eating disorders because of the idea that only size 6 or only size zero is good enough. It’s really damaging to society. I’m not aware of anything similar happening to people who want to be taller. It’s something you have to learn to accept. Honestly I can’t really defend people sticking a height requirement nor the people who specify races beyond like if you are both of a certain race if you’re really integrated in the cultures it can be supportive but woooow it’s just not the same as asking someone to be size 6,1544120966.0,10,6,0,11,"Like,Haha",2018,12,3,18,4.838925351154279,0.003997525160142512,0.5630994845679148,0,1,0,London,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,7714.493039114213,17,0.002203644479787094,145,799,1,0,0.114,0.195,0.691,2.3541666666666665,2.4745098039215687,-0.47123534025427366,0

1744,"You're at a Christmas party. You're talking about your favourite things about Christmas. Favourite foods, favourite traditions, what type of meat you're eating this year, which of your relatives are the most enthusiastic racists.
Then, the dreaded topic comes up. Favourite Christmas movies. Perfectly acceptable answers are put forward; ""Elf"", ""Muppets Christmas Carol"", ""Shrek the Halls"", but you're waiting. You're waiting for that one guy. That one guy who thinks he's original. He opens his mouth, your back tenses up and you start convulsing. Red foam starts erupting from your mouth and nostrils as you anticipate
""My favourite Christmas movie is Die Hard.""
I swear to god. I swear to fucking God. Everyone in the world has heard this, but every goddamn time someone says it they think they are the comedy messiah. It's always delivered with a shit-eating grin and bulging eyes, and an obvious belief that they have blown the minds of everyone listening. Well guess what, you haven't. We know. Everyone knows. My old alzheimers grandfather's dying words were ""Die Hard is a Christmas movie"", because after he said it I immediately unplugged his life support as he had clearly finally lost all mental traces of originality.

2034,"here's a hot take on a men's officer at the guild:
if men's issues are apparently covered by existing officers, are there specific events for men who need assistance in these areas? i know at other universities that the womens n non-binary associations offer support/consciousness raising groups for men to discuss how toxic masculinity and other patriarchal structures negatively affect them and counter this.
i've only ever seen events that are women & non-binary people only - i completely agree that these are necessary, but have the guild considered organising a space for men to discuss these things? wouldnt have to be organised by wanba, could maybe be organised by welfare officer or disability officer.
forgive me if this already exists and i am unaware
i don't think it's helpful to shout at people whenever a men's officer is suggested. i disagree with the concept, because it suggests that the problems men face are the same as the systematic oppression faced by other minority groups.

1247,"To any freshers (or above!) who are worried about pre-established groups or ‘cliquey’ societies, please know that it isn’t because they don’t want to get to know you! I was so intimidated joining societies with really tight groups last year but if you stick at it then it becomes less scary - from my experience it’s because they’ve become good friends and hang out outside of the society, not because they’re not open to new people. There’ll always be friendly people who will reach out if you feel a bit lost (committees are a good place to start if you’re apprehensive, their whole thing is helping bring new people to the society) and you’ll meet some amazing people, I met some of my closest friends in societies!",1569605405.0,3,0,0,3,Like,2019,9,4,18,4.843288674284265,0.004277569313094809,0.565263096110026,0,1,0,London,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,10094.145855150176,3,0.000297201966669558,127,718,1,0,0.071,0.218,0.711,1.9791666666666667,2.156862745098039,-0.2561514347214025,0

1062,Me and my boyfriend are long distance. We call about 4 times a week for 20-30 mins. We see each other every 3 weeks or so. The problem is more often than not while we are talking he is also playing a Steam game or scrolling through Facebook or reading BBC sport and I can tell he’s not listening. I can hear his keyboard tapping away too lol. I’ve asked if he is too busy and I wouldn’t mind calling a bit less if it meant it was a quality call but he wants to call this much!!! I’ve brought it up but he doesn’t stop.
