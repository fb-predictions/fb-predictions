In my opinion, Boston was just as much of a strong community on April 14th as it was on April 15, yet not too many people took notice. I am by no means saying that it is wrong to show support in this time of despair; in fact, I think that is exactly what we need. But who says this support has to suddenly stop in a week or two? Its amazing that sometimes it takes a tragedy to show us what we really care about. Boston was there all along. Every single person who you texted or who texted you today was there too. It really only takes a little compassion, some empathy, and maybe holding open a few doors. All I am asking is please don't let this tragedy go unanswered.

We know that these cancer-sticks are bad for us — it’s written on the fucking pack. After a long day, we like to unwind with an oral fixation that calms our nerves. If you have another way to unwind, GREAT! I’m glad you don’t have to torture your lungs for relaxation but if I choose to, that’s my fucking choice. I can’t speak for all smokers, but I always try to avoid blowing smoke into a crowd of people and don’t even take puffs if children are in the vicinity. If you’re worried about second-hand smoke, move the fuck away. Don’t walk behind a smoker. Smoking is illegal in all enclosed areas so the second-hand smoke you all must be talking about has to be outdoors, in which case, unless you’re within 18-inches of the fucking person, you’re fine. Most of you can’t even walk that close to a person in general without feeling awkward. If people smoking indoors or right by entrances are your problem, then I agree.

A week or so later, we started hooking up regularly, and despite how most friends with benefits arrangements end, we stayed friends, even through a couple of pretty bad fights. I think it's mostly because neither of us really wanted an actual relationship, and we get along so well that the sex part just sort of fit into our friendship. It got to the point where we were pretty much a couple in everything but official name, and we tried to break it off. It didn't work.
Our friends think we've stopped hooking up, but we really haven't. The two of us are still best friends. So we spent Valentine's Day together because neither of us felt like wallowing in self-pity with our friends, and afterwards, I came to a very significant conclusion:
I am in love with my best friend.

I almost wanted to laugh because it was so painful to listen to. I know she really doesn't care, but she was still so worried about saying something wrong.
Just because you're not homophobic or racist doesn't mean you know the correct vocabulary to use. And I think too many people are afraid to ask because even asking how to not be offensive can feel offensive.""",1422397968.0,142,5,0,142,Like,2015,1,1,17,4.590215932745087,0.003726924179338953,0.4390653282974264,1,0,0,New_York,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8817.21529506699,147,0.0166719304316231,178,936,1,0,0.148,0.107,0.745,3.0416666666666665,3.011764705882353,-0.37156625914712565,1

We're celebrating movies like Black Panther and Hidden Figures as inaugurating a new era of diversity (and rightly), but still the closest Asian people get to the Oscars is being the butt of Chris Rock's racist jokes. The largest mass lynching in American history was targeted at Asians, and the US literally nuked and bombed our part of the world to all hell, but we are but a footnote in your history.
This isn't to diminish the validity of what the complaint against university Dining. BHM should not be reduced to a caricature; black culture is more than ribs and and collard greens.

And that's a problem cuz I went from being able to do whatever to basically going back to high school where I have to share a room with my brother cuz both my sisters share a room. That's a problem cuz in a house with only one bathroom I have nowhere to jerk off.
So I do it on the back row of HEBB in the aforementioned seat. So please don't sit there cuz you may sit on my seed. And if you are waman, I don't wanna get you preggers by you sitting in the wrong place during the wrong time of the month.

In my Econ class, I met this insanely cute korean girl. We talked a little bit here and there. After the midterm, she saw my mark, a solid 99.5/100 ( this was my first ever university exam). Then she said more than once we should study together for the next time and for other classes that we shared in common. I never took her up on this though, because I was too nervous. This was uncharted territory for me. Was I going to just be a friend of hers and nothing more ( just like every other female friend I have), or could this be the stepping stone to something more? Now that was last November. I've seen her in Buchanan walking by a few times the last sem, and I've thought time and time again about just messaging her on facebook to kickstart conversation. Yet, doing that would be uncharted territory for me. Any other guys have similar experiences? Or will I be forever trapped.

Is it because of my severe acne? Has dating gone this far mad that superficial characteristics such as weight and looks are considered high above all else and not character, not stuff that actually matters such as how much of a good person I am?
Why can't I be born in the 50s when superficial looks didn't matter and technology like iPhones didn't exist so that boys could stop using apps like Tinder and actually try to have meaningful, fruitful relationships.
I've tried Tinder. But I either do not match or match with people who have less than admired characteristics or bots that literally swerve me.
Heck, I have Yeezy shoes, Gucci tops and Supreme backpacks and listen to k- pop and khip-hop like TWICE, BTS, Zico, Dean and DPR live. I find them all so boring but I do it because now, I can do k-pop covers.

So I volunteered to help out with move in day a couple years ago. And this mousy looking girl who looks to be 14 or 15 comes wandering over. She says she was on the beach, and doesn’t remember her name, and doesn’t remember where she lives. She has a phone number written in black sharpie on her arm. So we call it, it’s a friend of hers who lives IN SURREY and is coming to pick her up.... but she’s coming BY BUS so of course it’s going to take forever and I am asked to take care of this girl. So I’m talking to her, and trying to get some more info out of her. Apparently she did shrooms by herself on the beach. She keeps trying to kiss me and hit on me, and when I try to take her to the bathroom she ends up peeing herself.
I don’t think the volunteer coordinator thought much of it. I think he thought that from a heteronormative perspective, me taking care of this lost child made sense.

262,"Okay so about 6 weeks ago I got into a pretty severe car accident which resulted in a broken rib, a concussion, and pretty bad whiplash. When I went to the hospital, they advised me to take about 2 weeks off so that i could heal from my concussion and to take it easy. If my symptoms were still bad, they told me to take more days off and ease back into going to classes. BUT. university IS ABSOLUTE SHIT. When I told my academic counsellor about my situation and emailed all of my profs, they just said ""Your assignments won't be cancelled, the deadlines will just be pushed back. The weight is the same. FOR. ALL. 5. OF. MY. COURSES. So of course I only took like 4 days off because I have to keep my grades up which SIGNIFICANTLY worsened my condition and made me feel like shit every day. So a word to university—don't say that you want to make students feel safe and mentally/physically healthy when you really don't. I've been going to physio 4 times a week and my therapist told me that added stress and sitting down/studying for a long time would only worsen my condition, but university really doesn't give a fuck.

Essentially, anyone that decided to read the syllabi at the start of term and prioritize certain exams over others, was completely misinformed about how their grades would be allocated and is now likely going to suffer for it. To put this in perspective, some of us had profs that specifically told us that if we did poorly on the midterms, they would re-weight them to the final if we performed better on that than the midterms. So, some of us decided to prioritize studying for other classes with midterms that same week.

990,"As an university graduate and alumni, one of the biggest regrets that I have is having neglected to develop the social & romantic aspects of my life while I was a student. Dating and forging friendships are tremendously more difficult while out of school/working compared to being on campus, where you are surrounded by like-minded peers who share the same struggles and aspirations as you.
Granted, there certainly are upsides to bootstrapping your romance department post-school, such as less academic/parental pressure and greater emotional maturity among those in the dating pool, but I cannot help but feel that starting this late in life (I'm ~24 by the way) has been far more of a rocky climb than I had anticipated.
My advice for younger folks who are in university is, while focusing on academics and professional development are undoubtedly the most crucial part of your life at this stage, please don't forget to nurture your social and/or love life; treat the latter the same way you would your academics (although not necessarily to the same extent). After all, the ultimate goal of having a post-secondary education is to have better things in life, and I cannot stress the importance of friendship & intimacy in this pursuit.",1548259201.0,164,87,0,194,"Like,Sad,Wow",2019,1,2,8,2.0943951023931953,0.9330127018922194,0.2500000000000001,0,0,1,Vancouver,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29164.73237365588,281,0.009634924689170939,206,1233,1,0,0.076,0.169,0.755,3.625,4.176470588235294,1.467535399577176,2

I've been to many universities around the world in different countries in US, UK etc. and NEVER have I ever heard students chatting loudly in libraries - if they do at all. They would be courteous and step outside and bring the conversation somewhere else.
Some of my high school classmates who go to university elsewhere are always confused when I tell them that I can't study in university libraries because of the noise volume.
Sure, you might say that I've studied here for 4 years and should be used to the noise by now or found a silent study space on campus. At the same time, I simply don't understand how students casually meet up in libraries for a chat. Sure, IKB is a learning centre with classrooms and that's a different story.

I still see her from time to time, and she has never treated me any differently. We had a class together this semester and she even friended me on Facebook.

405,"Ever meet someone who is basically a carbon copy of another one of your friends? It can be different things – sometimes they look the same, sometimes they act the same, sometimes it’s the same personality. It’s like talking to one of them constantly makes you think “oh ya, they talk/act/gesture just like…”. Well this past semester I met someone who carries themselves a lot like one of my friends. It’s in the hand gestures and the stance – it’s basically identical. I noticed it one day when we were hanging out and he was telling a story and the hand gestures he used, the angle he held his head, it was a dead ringer. Which is ironic, I guess. Since the friend he reminds me of is dead. The craziest thing is that my friend passed away sometime in the early summer, and then right in the fall I found this new guy who seemed to be an echo of him. Like he just left and came back as another person. Right after I noticed this – it became hard to talk to him. Like pulling teeth. Everything he did reminded me of how I lost my person. We don’t talk anymore (Puth, 2016), and I never gave an explanation – probably because I can’t talk about this too long without crying. There is no ending to this story, I guess. I hope that I don’t lose more people to this. It sucks. He was nice.

The same day, he apologized so I decided to give him a second chance because I have no self respect and agreed to see him the next day. I went over to his place and had a typical tinder date, after the date he practically ghosted me and messaged me again weeks later because he wanted to get his dick wet again. I gained a little bit more of self respect for myself so I ignored him and he blocked me. A year later (few days ago) I saw him on campus and he UGLYYYYYYYYYY (thank god) Karma got him well.

On the other hand, I'm obviously grateful that I have a place to live and food and everything I need is provided for me. But the threats and the name calling really have to stop. They happen so randomly too, which makes it super hard to avoid. (Maybe once a month or two months.)

I realise they can be expensive! I use the organicup which cost £21 for 2. Other companies such as the heygirls cup only cost around £9 and although I haven’t used it myself I’m sure it’s just as good! Last I checked you could buy them in ripple living!

What is everyone's opinions on splitting bills during this lockdown time. Understandably, 3 out of our 6 person household have returned home to self isolate with their families, leaving 3 of us still in our house in Cathays. Of course we've all signed a contract to split everything evenly, however those who are not here think that they should pay lower bills.
Is this fair?
Some of us do not have the same opportunity as others to go home home, and even if the house was empty there would still be bills that need to be paid as the house is still generating electricity/ connected to sewers, etc. Also the people who have left have the option to stay in cathays but have chosen to leave?

Denying that racism exists is something only a deluded or actively malicious individual of privilege can do. As a result, to ensure that Durfess remains a page where people feel comfortable engaging we will be permanently removing individuals who actively deny the existence of racism from the page.
Until we find a mechanism to ensure that posts on these issues are productive and informative (since even posts designed to be exactly that were met with a problematic response) we'll be moving this discourse to non-reach driven platforms like Overheard.

Has he not learnt from his days at St Olave's? Last year he was booked to do a talk with another former student on 'White lives matter's, in an attempt to make a mockery of the black lives matter campaign that was prevalent in the news at the time. The posters used for this campaign featured neo-nazi imagery, white supremacy and racially divisive comments. The actions of the current and former student body led to the talk being cancelled.

Forcibly entering students’ rooms to put their possessions into bin liners if you can’t collect in 5 days isn’t fair and certainly not within my contract? I understand the tricky situation but shouldn’t the system be opt-in? With no word about compensation for current students, I don’t understand why I’m paying to have somebody else stay in my room, use my kitchen utensils, help themselves to my food and I haven’t even consented to it?? My college haven’t even given me an opportunity to opt-out of this. I can’t afford petrol or a train ticket to come up and retrieve my possessions, and I’m worried they might damage my possessions that I left behind. I asked whether I could move back and self-isolate / social distance in Durham for the next few months in order to prevent this, but was then told that I was not allowed?? How is this legal?

I have 2 NHS workers as parents and have been categorised as a high risk for getting this, in the past 3 weeks I have watched my parents come home from 13 hour intense shifts, then have a 12 hour reset to go back out and do it all over again. The worst part of this job? They can’t hug their kids or spend quality time due to high risk of infection.
This is just my experience however. There are thousands like me, NHS or not, who can’t spend time with family due to COVID19. Hundreds of thousands are dead, their families not able to even say goodbye or mourn at their funeral. Jobs are being lost yes, but any more lives lost will be more upsetting. Jobs can be replaced, new jobs will come and you’ll be able to get back up for it. However, a human life can not ever be replaced or regained and you want to compare deaths to the economy?? What? You see how idiotic it is right?
I don’t know if this will even get posted but please listen; stop complaining about the economy, stop making unnecessary trips, stop spreading this virus and please show your appreciation for Healthcare workers of any form risking their health and sanity for your safety.

247,"Responding to edifess I don’t think it’s entirely fair to call students of a whole degree ‘selfish’ for wanting to know the direction their degree goes in for a couple of reasons:
1. For many people, the year abroad was the most attractive thing about the degree and perhaps they wanted to study languages for the sole purpose of being able to practice it abroad.
2. The immersion into the country and being able to talk to locals all the time is the most important part of your language learning
3. I don’t think it’s any different from people wanting clarity from the government vis à vis the state of the country; languages students wanting to know the outcome of their degree is entirely the same.
4. It’s so over the top to say it’s ‘the most selfish thing you’ve ever seen’, we all care about our respective degrees so don’t deny you’d be just as worried if it was your degree xxx

1981,"The Higher Education Policy Institute calculated Gini coefficients for the Participation of Local Areas (POLAR) in the 2016 UG admissions cycle. They ranked all UK higher education institutions in terms of their coefficients. A coefficient of 0 means that the institution is “perfectly equal” and a coefficient of 1 means that the institution is “perfectly unequal”.
“The best measure on equity of participation in the UK is the POLAR (Participation of Local Areas) system. Based on the higher education participation rates for individual areas, the POLAR system ranks wards according to their participation rates and then divides them into five groups (quintiles), each of which holds an equal proportion of the young cohort. The quintiles are numbered 1 to 5, with quintile 1 areas having the lowest participation rates and quintile 5 the highest.”
The University of Edinburgh: 0.42
Edinburgh Napier University: 0.35
For context the best in the UK was the University of Hull with a coefficient of 0.03 and the worst was the University of Cambridge with a coefficient of 0.48. The average for a UK institution was 0.18.
BOTH of the universities have issues with class and University of Edinburgh is the superior university in terms of academia in almost every measure (See QS world rankings and methodology). It is not as simple as classifying students as classist when the university they are criticising for being less academic also have a MAJOR problem with admitting students from working class backgrounds.

606,To me it seems unfair that the group of people who self identify (into the categories of liberation officers) are able to control such a large part of the EUSA committee. The liberation officers are still representatives of the student body as a whole and NOT just for the marginalised groups they represent. As far as I’m aware the liberation officers had just as much of a role in voting for solidarity with the strikes as any other member of EUSA . So if they’re able to vote on everyone’s behalf like that then everyone should be able to vote for them. It seems odd and counter productive that in a liberal university we are willing to discount the voices of roughly 1/2 the student body. Furthermore who is there to voice our concerns?

I looked at him and he looked at me, I think in passing. And then when I got to the top of the stairs, I looked back at him for a second and saw him looking back at me. Not wanting to imagine it all, I sat down at a computer.
Then I realized I had a sock stuck by static to the inside of my fleece which was open. I don't know how it got there. That probably explains why I thought he smiled at me.

Last year my boyfriend at the time sexually assaulted me (I think). We’d had a drink and he started trying things when we were in bed. I really hate sex whilst I’m drunk because of a traumatic previous experience, and he knew this. I tried to stop him verbally at first and he kept going, putting his hands down my pants and kissing my neck when I wouldn’t kiss him back so I had to physically push him off of me. He stopped after that and went to sleep. I felt off around him for a few days afterwards and eventually brought it up, to which he said he couldn’t remember it happening but he did actually apologise for it and so I tried to forget about it.
We dated for maybe 3/4 months after this but we didn’t actually do anything sexual. I still thought we were happy and blamed other things for the lack of sex. We broke up eventually (he cheated on me lol) but we stayed friends because we got on well and had a lot in common.
But lately, I’ve been rethinking everything and should I really have forgiven him just because he was drunk and said sorry? Should I talk to him about it again even though it happened last year? I kinda just needed to get this off of my chest because I’ve seen a lot of people speaking out lately, and also because I really could do with any advice at all , sad.",1593521708.0,15,4,0,36,"Like,Sad,Care",2020,6,1,13,3.6433748135381627,0.25950561554030627,0.0616366221462461,0,1,0,London,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,30080.74547930589,40,0.0013297542784475897,253,1308,1,0,0.148,0.083,0.769,4.604166666666667,4.470588235294118,1.5503288537125128,0

143,"Have just graduated, and I am super emotional.
These last three years have genuinely been the best of my life; despite my second week of first year literally turning my life upside down.
My best friend died and I wasn't sure whether I could carry on, or meet any new people. And without doubt, I have had serious issues over the last three years; however, the people that I've met have gone above and beyond their duty in helping and supporting me through some tough times. I would like to think that I have repaid the favour.
So, if you're a prospective student and/or someone who's just finished first year, let me tell you this. There will be tough times, there's no denying that. However, there are some truly sensational people at Leeds who I know will help anyone through anything.
Enjoy it, and make the absolute most of it. I know it sounds like a cliché now, but before you know it, you'll be in my position, graduating; and literally begging for those three years again.

Many cultural societies are widely inclusive, providing a space, community and a home from those missing their home and/or for those wanting to learn about other people's cultures and traditions! Although some societies may have their own problems with inclusiveness, let us not forget the importance of cultural societies at the university!

1576,"Before I start, this does not reflect my views on homeless people in general. Only a select few.
I've been at university for about two years now. In my first week, I was with a friend and was approached by a homeless woman who told me her story and basically asked for money. I said I had no change and only had money in my card but my friend gave her a couple of pounds. She then turned to us and asked us for more and said to me ""there's an atm nearby, we can go there and you can withdraw the money"". At which point I walked away and didn't think much of it.
Up until today where I saw the same woman doing the exact same thing to other people in the area. What I don't get is how this person has made zero progress in their life over these two years. I decided to stand nearby having my lunch and eavesdropped and her story was the same word to word. What little shred of sympathy I had got lost instantly since she appears to be a professional rather than someone in genuine need of help.
I'll probably be judged for writing this but beginning to lose sympathy for the homeless people around university since I've been seeing the same people for the past two years.

Is it a case of people unwilling to change or our government being shit?",1544828339.0,18,1,0,24,"Like,Sad,Wow",2018,12,4,22,6.012659273120464,0.366380811960871,0.9818152266043114,0,1,0,London,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,14093.463084413223,25,0.001773872032037956,251,1280,1,0,0.05,0.089,0.861,4.5625,4.36078431372549,0.10532514847517636,0

Every time you listen through again, you hear something new and and realise just how much betrayal and just pure shit she's had to take from men in her life for the past decade. Just the fact that so many tracks sound happy while having lyrics that are depressing as hell is so damn poetic and I relate to it so deeply. 2017 was the year of revival for old pop punk and emo bands, and Paramore definately led the way, I'm so sad they didn't receive the recognition they deserved.",1521497245.0,13,6,0,19,"Like,Love",2018,3,0,22,5.790129793491189,0.2633401664075784,0.9404453691026928,0,1,0,London,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11019.214531174755,25,0.002268764250779566,175,965,1,0,0.191,0.063,0.747,2.9791666666666665,3.1254901960784314,-0.17253949671738328,0

1672,"> Since there's been some posts about body positivity, as well as some news articles, I thought I would say this:
I know it's a sensitive issue for people, and of course no one should have to feel awful about their image. But 'bodypositivity' can also lead to the trap of embracing an unhealthy life. Being very overweight has clear risks and dangers associated with it, not to mention costs to others in the form of socialized healthcare. It's fine to be positive about yourself, but it would be foolish to use that as a reason to do nothing about your weight. Pretending that there's no problem, or implying that being overweight is just ""another shape"" is wrong, because that involves lying to yourself and to others. Being honest with yourself is the first step towards living a healthier life.

I couldn't handle doing what my gut told me to do and then making things worse.
My confession? I still care about her more than any other person in my life, including me. I think about her all the time. She's the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about as I fall asleep. I wonder if she's doing well, going to class, drinking water, and feeling good. I wonder if she thinks those same things about me.

1371,"Confession 1325 is right. The dominant culture at Berkeley is East Asian culture, and the Asians students here do try to make others feel inferior. The funny thing is, out of all the people I've known at Berkeley, the only ones who for the most part don't make friends with people of other races have been students of East Asian descent. Many of the Asian ethnic orgs here besides VSA (VSA honestly does the most to celebrate their culture and its the only one where I've seen non-Vietnamese and even non-Asian people join and actually be accepted), are just excuses to self-segregate and party. Even clubs that aren't ethnic orgs are clearly recruiting along racial lines. If you look at groups like Innovative Design, Circle K, Ascend, AFX, and countless others, the officers are members are ALL or mostly all EAST ASIAN. I love Asian culture and I'm glad I grew up around it, but honestly the hardcore Asian vibe and lack of diversity here has really ruined the experience at Cal for me. It shocks me when Asian students here complain about all these racist white people and say all of these racist things, but when I hang around white people, latinx people, and indian people I almost never hear a single hint or word of racism out of them towards East Asians or other groups.

Before I begin, let me say that I'm a korean-american male in STEM, and I certainly believe I was treated unfairly by college admissions.
However, I think we (asians) should support racial affirmative action.
The big con: it actively hurts us and favors white students over Asians. No one seems to talk about that specific detail.
Here's the thing though. It helps every other minority group. I firmly believe that the only way Asians will be respected in this country is if all minorities are respected. AA is an issue that divides Asians against other minorities and puts us on the side of white people. This is a tactic that oppressors use to, you know, oppress. Divide and conquer all the groups and convince them that these other groups are the enemy. Remember the LA riots, where the police basically blocked off a section of the city and let Koreans and black people kill each other? So AA might be less dramatic than that, but it's still important.

There is a HUGE cheating problem at this school and professors overlook it because of “paperwork” and other administrative things. It fosters a toxic environment and an unrealistic representation of tasks faced in the real world. For example, I’m a student in the college of chemistry where the course material is very very difficult and many people switch majors after the first year. There are students in my class who are known cheaters and have been seen on tests with writing on their arms, phones out, notes on the floor. And when people go up to report them, the GSIs claim to do something about it but do nothing. Saying they lack substantial evidence. All you have to fucking do is walk up to a student who is accused of cheating and watch them... look at the floor for notes, look at their arms for notes, see if THEIR PHONE IS ON THIER DESK.

783,"It's quite funny how I screwed myself over in my first semester at Berkeley. I probably did pretty poorly in my classes, but that's because I threw in the worst way possible.
I did decently well to set myself up for mid-range grades in each of my classes across all our midterms, through hard work and grinding it out in the library consistently and efficiently.
Then, during dead week and finals week, I just completely lost all motivation to study. Couldn't get myself to go to study sessions or to do even a single practice test, nop. I literally sat in my room and played games, went to a friend's dorm, nap, socialize, whatever it was so I wouldn't have to study. Then when the wave of finals started to roll around, I did some last minute studying and pushed out some cheat sheets idiotically like a fart coming out unsure of whether to be speedy, smelly or noisy.
Now that I've finished finals and gone home, I don't even have a desire to relax and play games or watch TV shows.

1020,"Hey fellow bears. I'm a girl, and I want to have casual hook ups just like anyone else...but I personally know that I'm not ready for vaginal sex yet. A) It hurts and is kinda uncomfortable (yeah I know, more lube no need to tell me, and no nothing is wrong with my vagina tyvm) and B) I want to experience that with someone I have an emotional connection. I'm a romantic. Sue me.
I don't know if this is really true, but I feel like hook-up culture is based on the idea that the girl is willing to give/receive vaginal sex. I want to let out my inner hoe (and UST) but I'm scared that any partners I meet won't be interested in doing other things, and that I won't be able to give them a good time. Are these actual issues? Is it all in my head? Any advice for me?

So can anyone tell me about the process of getting counselling? I'm interested in options OUTSIDE UEA. I've heard so many things from different sources. One of these is that you can go to your gp to have some sessions prescribed that will be on the nhs? (I think 25 max or so) But I'm concerned that they will not give this to me solely on the basis that I think I need it. Who do I go to that can decide what sort of therapy would be best and what exactly my problem is? Should I just straight up try to get an appointment with a psychologist? Any recommendations?

Everyone had to work so hard to get into university from different situations of quality of teaching and family support and income. And we’re all in the same university investing in ourselves. We are all dedicating our education to a certain field that suits our learning, our individual skills and for a career for ourselves.

1825,"I'm really hating being home for Christmas. My family switched mine and my sister's bedrooms around whilst I was away, all my stuff is packed away and my new bedroom is smaller than my one at uni now. It feels so lonely being away from my friends, and I had a full on breakdown earlier because I felt so unwelcome and separated from my family. The only reason I'm staying is because I've made a commitment to my manager to work , which I genuinely look forward to more than coming home, and that my boyfriend is nearby when he normally isn't whilst I'm at uni. I'm honestly just missing being alone and away from my incredibly annoying younger sisters.
My family push the family aspect of the festive season too much for me, I'm now at a stage where I wish I could just spend christmas day with my boyfriend and my cat, rather than be forced to spend time with extended family. Basically, I'm dreading Christmas this year.
If anyone has any ideas as to how to cope with this please let me know, I'm seriouslt thinking about going back to uni because I'm just that upset.
And yes, I have spoken to my parents about it - my mum told me to grow up. For context, my boyfriend is pushing me to seek treatment for depression and I think I either have autism or BPD.

Today, I heard about some truly shocking behaviour that occured within earshot of my friend, and without regard to how she may have felt in regard to this.
I find it almost unbelievable that young people in this day and age feel the need to inflate their own egos by belittling others (particularly women) just because their mummies and daddies have paid for them to get here.
Little gestures and comments such as 'are you sure you're right?' and automatically correcting women in any environment is completely unacceptable. We need to put a stop to this!
